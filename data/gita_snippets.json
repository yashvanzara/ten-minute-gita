        "Dhritarashtra said: \"O Sanjaya, assembled on the holy field of Kurukshetra, eager to fight—what did my sons and the sons of Pandu do?\"",
        "Sanjaya replied: \"Having seen the Pandava army arranged in battle formation, King Duryodhana approached his teacher Drona and spoke.\"",
        "\"O Teacher, look at this great army of Pandu's sons, arranged by the son of Drupada—your wise disciple.\""
      ],
      "commentary": "Think about this for a moment: the Bhagavad Gita doesn't begin with Krishna. It doesn't begin with Arjuna. It begins with a blind man asking a question from his palace, miles away from the battlefield.\n\nDhritarashtra couldn't see. But his blindness wasn't just physical—and that's precisely the point.\n\nThe day before this war, the sage Vyasa came to Dhritarashtra and offered him something extraordinary. \"I can give you divine sight,\" Vyasa said. \"You can witness everything that happens on this battlefield.\"\n\nDhritarashtra's response? \"No, thank you. I'm comfortable as I am. But if you're offering, give it to Sanjaya instead.\"\n\n*I'm comfortable in my blindness.*\n\nHow many times have we said the same thing, in different words? We don't want to see what's really happening in our marriage. We don't want to acknowledge what that habit is doing to us. We'd rather not look too closely at how we're living our lives. Chosen blindness feels easier than facing difficult truths.\n\nThe Gita begins here because this is where most of us begin—not wanting to see.\n\nNow look at the first words Dhritarashtra speaks: *\"Dharmakshetre Kurukshetre\"*—at the field of Dharma, at Kurukshetra.\n\nHe calls it Dharmakshetra. The field of righteousness. He knows. Somewhere deep down, Dhritarashtra knows exactly which side represents Dharma in this war. He's not confused about right and wrong. He simply can't bring himself to act on what he knows.\n\nThis is one of the Gita's earliest teachings, tucked into its very first line: knowing what's right is not the same as doing what's right. Dhritarashtra knew. He just couldn't act.\n\nThere's something else hidden in this verse—a single word that reveals everything about why this war is happening. The word is *\"Māmakāḥ\"*—mine.\n\n\"What did *my* sons and *Pandu's* sons do?\"\n\nBut wait. Weren't they all grandsons of the same man? Weren't the Pandavas also descendants of Kuru? Why aren't they all simply \"Kauravas\"?\n\nBecause Dhritarashtra couldn't see them that way. *My* children versus *their* children. *My* family versus *those people*. This is how he saw the world. This is how the world always divides itself before it goes to war.\n\nWe do this too, don't we? My team versus their team. My community versus outsiders. We draw these lines constantly, and then we wonder why there's so much conflict. The Gita is pointing at something fundamental here: this *mine versus yours* thinking is the seed from which all conflict grows.\n\nIn verse 2, the scene shifts to the battlefield. Sanjaya begins his narration, and immediately we see something curious: Duryodhana, the mighty king with the larger army, is nervous.\n\nHe had eleven akshauhinis—massive military divisions. The Pandavas had only seven. By any calculation, he should win. Yet look at what he does: he rushes to his teacher Drona, not to the commander Bhishma, and starts anxiously pointing out the enemy's strengths.\n\nWhy would someone with such an advantage feel so unsettled?\n\nBecause numbers aren't everything. Duryodhana knew, in some part of himself, that he was on the wrong side of this fight. He had stolen a kingdom. He had tried to kill his cousins. He had humiliated Draupadi in open court. All the military might in the world couldn't quiet that knowledge.\n\nThis is something worth sitting with: when you're doing the right thing, you can face challenges with a certain peace. When you're not, no amount of external advantage makes you feel secure. Duryodhana had everything going for him—except the one thing that would have given him real confidence.\n\nAnd then comes verse 3, where Duryodhana speaks to Drona. On the surface, he's just pointing out the Pandava formation. But listen to his words more carefully: \"Look at this army, arranged by the son of Drupada—*your wise disciple*.\"\n\nThere's an accusation buried in that phrase. *Your* disciple. The one *you* taught. Duryodhana is essentially saying: \"This is your fault, teacher. You trained them. You gave them the skills they're now using against us.\"\n\nThis is how it works when we're not willing to own our choices. We blame the teacher, the parents, the circumstances, the system—anyone but ourselves. Duryodhana never once stopped to ask: \"How did my own actions lead us here?\" Instead, he looked for someone else to hold responsible.\n\nThere's a deeper teaching embedded in the structure of these opening verses that often gets overlooked. Notice how Vyasa, the author, chose to begin the text. He could have started with Krishna's teaching. He could have opened with some grand philosophical statement about the nature of reality. Instead, he begins with a question born from anxiety.\n\nDhritarashtra asks: *\"Kim akurvata\"*—what did they do? He's desperate to know. He can't bear the uncertainty. And this desperation reveals something crucial about the nature of attachment.\n\nWhen we are deeply attached to an outcome, uncertainty becomes unbearable. We need to know. We check our phones constantly. We ask the same questions over and over. We cannot rest until we have information that confirms or denies our hopes and fears.\n\nDhritarashtra is not simply curious about the battle. He is terrified. His whole sense of security—the kingdom he helped his son steal, the dynasty he hoped to establish—depends on the outcome of this war. No wonder he's asking questions before a single arrow has been fired.\n\nThe Gita begins this way to show us something about ourselves. How much of our mental activity is driven by this same anxious need to know? How much of our day is spent checking, confirming, seeking reassurance?\n\nSwami Chinmayananda used to point out that Kurukshetra was not just any battlefield—it was considered sacred ground. The name literally means \"field of the Kurus,\" the ancestral dynasty. But it was also called Dharmakshetra because it was a place where great sages had performed austerities and spiritual practices for generations.\n\nThere's a profound symbolism here. The battle for dharma—for right living—doesn't happen in some pristine spiritual environment away from the mess of life. It happens right here, on the same ground where our ancestors walked, where our family dramas play out, where the stakes are highest and the relationships most complicated.\n\nYou don't get to choose a convenient time and place for your spiritual growth. The battlefield finds you. It might be your workplace, your marriage, your relationship with your aging parents, your own health crisis. The question is never \"how do I avoid the battle?\" The question is \"how do I face it with clarity?\"\n\nConsider also the role of Sanjaya in these verses. He's the narrator, the one with divine sight, granted by Vyasa. Throughout the Gita, Sanjaya reports what's happening on the battlefield to the blind king.\n\nSanjaya represents something important: the possibility of true seeing. Unlike Dhritarashtra, who chose blindness, Sanjaya accepted the gift of vision. He can see the truth, and he reports it faithfully, even when that truth is painful to hear.\n\nEvery one of us has access to our own inner Sanjaya—that part of us that knows the truth, that sees clearly, that isn't fooled by our rationalizations. The question is: do we listen to it? Or do we, like Dhritarashtra, prefer to remain comfortable in our blindness?\n\nThe Gita is, in one sense, an invitation to become our own Sanjaya—to develop the capacity to see our lives clearly, to witness our own dramas with some degree of objectivity, to tell ourselves the truth even when it's inconvenient.\n\nOne more thing worth noting about these opening verses: the emotional tone. There's urgency here. There's anxiety. There's blame. There's defensiveness. The battlefield hasn't even begun, and already we see the full range of human reactivity on display.\n\nThis is intentional. The Gita doesn't pretend that we come to spiritual teaching from a place of calm readiness. We come to it desperate, confused, looking for someone to blame, terrified of what might happen. We come to it exactly as Arjuna will come to it in the verses ahead—overwhelmed and unable to function.\n\nAnd that's okay. That's the starting point. The Gita meets us where we are.\n\nFinally, let's consider the setting of these opening verses from a practical perspective. Here is Duryodhana, about to fight the most important battle of his life, and instead of focusing on strategy or inspiring his troops, he's complaining to his teacher about the enemy's strengths.\n\nThis is what anxiety does to us. It makes us focus on threats rather than possibilities. It makes us rehearse worst-case scenarios. It makes us seek validation for our fears rather than courage for our actions.\n\nDuryodhana had assembled the greatest army the world had ever seen. He had legendary warriors on his side—Bhishma, Drona, Karna, Ashwatthama. He had every material advantage. And yet here he is, fixated on what the other side has, unable to appreciate his own resources.\n\nWe do this constantly. We have health, relationships, skills, opportunities—and we obsess over what we lack. We have support systems and capabilities—and we fixate on the obstacles. This is the Duryodhana mind at work, and it never leads anywhere good.\n\nThe antidote isn't positive thinking or denial of real challenges. The antidote is clarity—seeing what we actually have, what the situation actually requires, and acting from that clear seeing rather than from anxiety and complaint.\n\nThat's the journey the Gita will take us on. But it starts here, with recognizing where we are: blind like Dhritarashtra, anxious like Duryodhana, looking for someone to blame. Only when we see this clearly can we begin to move beyond it.",
      "reflection": "So what do we take from this into our own lives?\n\nFirst, there's the question of sight. What are you choosing not to see? What uncomfortable truth are you avoiding because ignorance feels easier? Dhritarashtra's tragedy wasn't his blindness—it was his refusal of sight when it was offered. We have that same choice, every day.\n\nThen there's the *mamakah* problem—the way we divide the world into mine and not-mine. Pay attention to this in yourself. Notice how often your thinking draws these boundaries. My department versus theirs. My kind of people versus those others. These divisions feel natural, but they're the source of tremendous suffering.\n\nAnd finally, there's the matter of confidence. If you find yourself feeling anxious despite having every advantage, it might be worth asking: Am I on the right side of this? Real confidence doesn't come from having more resources or more power. It comes from knowing that what you're doing is aligned with something true.\n\nThe Gita opens with a blind king, a nervous prince, and an army poised for destruction. It opens this way because this is where transformation begins—not in some serene mountain retreat, but in the mess of human conflict, fear, and confusion.\n\nThe battlefield isn't just Kurukshetra. It's wherever you are right now, facing whatever you're facing. And the question the Gita asks is the same one Dhritarashtra asked: What will you do?"

      "commentary": "We'll be discussing bhagavad Gita. Chapter 1, Arjuna Vishada Yoga Yoga of Arjuna's Grief. In our scriptural system, there are two types of scripture. They're divided into two major categories. One is called Shruti. The other is called Smriti.\n\nShruti means herd and Smriti means remembered. So the scriptures which are considered heard by the great sages in their contemplation, in their inspired moments, and then given out to the world, are considered Srutis. And then based on those scriptures, the truths found in those scriptures in Sruti, the system in the society, the laws of society, the customs and traditions of society, they developed by the scriptures, are called smrutis. So Shrutis are typically considered as Prasthana trays. There are three legs of Sridhi. One is the Upanishads, which we have all learned.\n\nThey come at the end of the Vedas. Vedas generally describe all types of sciences which are in nature utilitarian or material which one can use in his lifetime. But the end of the Veda, there are dialogues between students and teachers. They are called Upanishads. They deal with this fundamental question we all ask, knowingly or unknowingly, who am I? Is there someone who has control over my life and what is my relationship with that controller?\n\nSo they are called openly set. So these are dialogues between students and teachers. But they are set in an environment of a serene Himalayan valleys. And both students and teachers are highly evolved seekers. The teacher is a realized master who has gone through his Sadhana and realize what the truth is. Student is also highly evolved seeker who has gone through Sadhana and now finding his final answers.\n\nThe truths in Srutis are immutable. Rather, they cannot be changed over a period of time, from one age to another. The Shruti does not change. The truths revealed in Srutis do not change. Smriti, on the other hand, are the laws created by society, by the leaders of the society. The lawmakers in the society are adaptable to the new environment in the society.\n\nSo the two mains we hear about are Parasara and Manusmriti. Mainly manusmriti is the one which we hear most, we heard most about. In fact, if I'm not mistaken, the laws in India before independence and somewhat after the independence were structured based on Manusmriti. Laws for Hindus were Hindu laws and they were based on Manusmriti. And laws for Muslims were based on Syria. So the Manusmriti was considered the code of conduct for the society.\n\nAnd as we know that we don't apply Manusmriti as is in our society now. Even in India the laws have changed, society has changed. The basic structure may remain what Manusmriti says but lot of things we have updated to fit with our current needs. On the other hand, the facts revealed in Shruti are unchangeable. It is something like I can use mathematics in my life right from my childhood to my old age, depending on my own needs. I'll interpret mathematics accordingly.\n\nBut the fundamentals of mathematics do not change. 2/2 remain 4 when I was in my kg, it still remains 4 when I'm an old man and consider myself to be a wise person. The spiritual tenets in Shruti are like those rules which are unchangeable. They remain constant no matter how you look at it, how you try to prove it. But the application of those laws can change according to society. So mathematics, the way I used in my childhood is different than when I used as a high school student, then as a college student and then as a professional are different.\n\nMy applications are different based on my own situation. So Smriti are like those adaptable sciences which we can update as we go along in our society. So Manus Smriti, maybe the fundamentals may remain same but the application is completely changed in our society now. So there are three, three aspects of the Sriti Upanishad as we talked about Brahma Sutra. And third is Bhagavad Gita. So Bhagavad Gita is considered Upanishad by itself.\n\nAnd therefore at the end of every chapter we'll say Upanishadsu Bhagavad Gita. So it's considered Upanishadh by itself because it reveals the truths which are revealed in Smruti. So it's considered part of the Shruti. The uniqueness of Bhagavad Gita is also considered Smriti. It's a combination of Shruti and Smriti. Therefore it has a unique place in Prasthantri.\n\nIn Prasthantari, if you just learn Upanishads, they are transcendental. It transcends my day to day life. It really tells me what the ultimate truth is and how it relates to me. And they are set in a very serene environment, as I said before. Bhagavad Gita on the other hand, is completely in a different environment. It's still dialogue between a student and a teacher.\n\nBut here the student teacher are also not a great master in a lowly seeker who is now trying to understand. They were two friends with a dialogue between two friends or two cousins. One was great, but he did not act like one when it comes to his friendship with his friend. So it's a dialogue between two equals set in an environment which is completely different from Himalayan valleys. It's on the battlefield. So some commentators think that the whole Mahabharata was written by Bhagavan Ved Vyas.\n\nTo have a platform for Bhagavad Gita, to have a Bhagavad Gita, he had to have a proper background to convert that into a scripture which can guide mankind. So entire Mahabharata, which is hundred thousand verses as we now know it, originally started out as book called Jaya and It is only 24,000 verses. But it did have Bhagavad Gita in it. So Bhagavad Gita is the central crown jewel of Mahabharata. Mahabharata became the greatest epic of all times for Hindu culture and for India and for the world because of Bhagavad Gita. You remove Bhagavad Gita and Mahabharata becomes another story of a Kuru clan.\n\nYou know, at the same token, you remove Mahabharata and Bhagavad Gita becomes merely a poetry, something similar to Upanishads. So they have a symbiotic relationship, the Mahabharata and Bhagavad Gita. Mahabharata converts Bhagavad Gita into a Smriti which can be used in a day to day life. Mahabharata gives us the background of human society, a human conditions, human aspirations, human shortcomings. So it is generally said that Mahabharata contains all human situations. If you don't find that situation Mahabharata it does not exist.\n\nYou may find the situation find in Mahabharata other works of art, but not other way around. So Mahabharata sets the stage and we all know the story so there is nothing really much to talk about how we get to the point where the war was about to begin. We all know the story Kauravadhan Pandav, the cousins they were fighting for the rights and Duryodhan said I'm not giving even a square inch of a land even though rightfully Pandavas were the claimant for that kingdom. The war is about to begin and we are now going to see a dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna because we all know the background story. So in the first chapter called Arjuna Vishadhi Yoga there are no great philosophical revelations so therefore one should not seek for philosophical Explanations in Chapter 1 Bhagavan Shankaracharya in his Gita Bhasya he does not start Bhasya till verse 11 of chapter 2. He didn't think it was worth his time to talk about chapter one and the first 10 verses of chapter two.\n\nBut for us common folks context is very important. Without context we lose the meaning of what we are discussing so we need to have context. It is very important to know the context. Chapter one gives us the context for the dialogue which is going to take place between Krishna and Arjuna. So as we now know Krishna and Arjuna are the two main characters in this dialogue but there are two other people who were involved in Bhagavad Gita One is Dhritarashtra and another is Sanjaya Dhritarashtra as we know was the Emperor of Hastinapur or King of Hastinapur and Duryodhan and other 19 and Kauravada his sons and he could have avoided this war by just his own declaration but he did not. He was blind from his birth and therefore he was not considered worthy of being the king but because the situation occurred with Pandu younger son he was made the caretaker king and Duryodhan became the effective king like MBS in Saudi Arabia.\n\nSo Duryodhan was the actual guy who was making the decisions and he obviously was not going to give up the kingdom which he has already been enjoying for last so many years. So when the war is about to begin Dhritarashtra is still sitting in the palace because he's not taking part in the war but he's curious about what's going on. He knew that on the Kaurava side there are 11 Akshoni Sena Pandavasa 7 Akshoni Senna so 11 plus 718 so you will see the 18 is the magic number for some reason there are 18. There are 18 books in Mahabharata. The war lasted 18 days. There are 18 chapters in Bhagavad Gita.\n\nAnd apparently one Aksoni has 21,870 chariots, the same amount of elephants, three times that of horses and five times that of foot soldiers. If you take any of these numbers and add those digits, they will add to 18. You take those numbers 21870 and add up. It will add up to 18. You take multiply that by three and they add up to 18. Again, multiply the five.\n\nSo if you do the math, there were about 4 million people on that battlefield. Now I know I've never been to Kurukshetra. I can't tell you they're large enough to hold 4 million people alone. But according to this calculation, the There are about 4 million soldiers ready to fight now. The war is about to begin. Dhritarashtra knew that his side is much stronger, 11 Akshoni say, whereas Pandava is only 7.\n\nBut he also knew who is on the right side and who was on the wrong side. So that gives you a little bit of a pause in thinking what is going to happen. He wanted to know what's going on and he had an opportunity. The day before Bhagavan Vidya stops by his palace and said, you really need to see what's happening and I can give you divine vision so that you can see that. But he said, I'm comfortable in my blindness. I really don't want to see.\n\nBut if you are really kind enough, give it to my minister Sanjaya the Divyadrasti Sanjay get the divine vision. Now we do not know how all that happened. Maybe Sanjay was on the battlefield and reported back. But it is believed that Sanjay has this divine vision. Not only he can see things which are happening on the battlefield, but he can also see what's going on in people's mind. He can hear, he can see and he can perceive.\n\nTherefore it's called Divya Dashti because he has much greater capacity than average person or even average person who has an ati Drasthi means he can see even further than a normal person. So Dhritarashtra knew that Sanjay can see everything. So the very first verse starts with Dhrutarastra Ovacha. You can see that Bhagavad Gita did not stand with Krishna Vacha or Bhagavan Vacha or Arjuna O Vacha. He started with Dhritarashtra. Dhritarashtra is the blind king These characters are there in Chapter one and in Mahabharata.\n\nSo we can identify with the situation. I may not be able to identify Darjun, but I can probably identify Dhritarashtra as a father. Maybe I have done something with Dhritarashtra did and therefore he suffered.",
      "reflection": "Consider a situation in your own life where you face conflicting duties—where doing right by one person or principle seems to require doing wrong by another. The Gita doesn't offer easy answers to such dilemmas, but it invites us to face them honestly rather than avoiding them.\n\nToday, notice if there's something you're choosing not to see because the truth would be uncomfortable. Dhritarashtra's tragedy wasn't his blindness—it was his refusal of sight when it was offered. What truths are you avoiding? What would happen if you faced them directly?\n\nThe battlefield isn't just Kurukshetra. It's wherever you are right now, facing whatever you're facing. And the question the Gita asks is the same one Dhritarashtra asked: What will you do?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter one, Arjuna Vishada Yoga Yoga of Arjuna's Grief. As we had discussed before, this is a chapter which gives us the context for the dialogue between Arjuna and Krishna. We have seen that Bhagavad Gita is part of the Prasthanatrei, one of the three legs of our philosophy, the Upanishads, Brahma Sutra and Bhagavad Gita. Bhagavad Gita has a unique place as we have discussed that it is not only a Shruti because it reveals the Brahma Vidya but it is also applicable for a day to day living a social order. Therefore it is also considered Smruti. So in that context we're seeing this chapter one as the study in comparison of how different people react to the same situation.\n\nSo we started this Bhagavad Gita with Dhritarashtra's query to Sanjaya what's happening at the battlefield? Dharmakshetra, Kurukshetra, Mamakaha, Pandavaschain. The very first thing we notice is how Dhritarashtra is thinking this world is divided into mine and yours, mine and rest of the world Mamakaha, mine and Pandava's. So this is the one issue which we deal with in philosophy that in our Advaita philosophy the root cause of all our problems is the duality. This duality which I have as I as an island by myself and then world is out there creates this friction between I and the world. So the very first indication, the first word is where we stand in this.\n\nWe are in the Dhrutrastra Sthiti. We see this world as I, mine and rest. And then as we further go into the chapter we see Sanjay's narration. Sanjaya starts his narration with what is Duryodhan doing? So we are seeing now the world from Duryodhan's perspective, same situation. The two armies are facing each other.\n\nWar is about to be started. We all know the background of why they are there very elaborately. The Mahabharata describes what happened before we came to this point of two armies facing each other. Now Duryodhan is looking at the situation. He sees the situation from a very different perspective. He sees from perspective whether the winnable or not winnable am I in a winning position or am I in a losing position?\n\nThe same situation as we say further in the chapter Arjuna looks at it very differently. He looks at it as whether right or wrong to be here. So it gives us various perspectives how we look at our lives when we face any situation depending on my own mental condition we look at the situation that way. Swamiji used to say the Scriptures are nothing but the mirror of our mind. Every time we read the Scriptures we see our own reflection in it. So we have seen that Sanjay first says that looking at the Pandavas army Raja Duryodhan went to Drona and told him thus.\n\nAnd then he discovered what he told Drona. First of all, as we know the commander in chief on Kaurava's side with Bheeshma Pandava side with Drishtudhumna, Drupad's son. So if Duryodhana had to go to anybody, if he had any question, doubt or explanation he should have gone to Visma and said let's make sure that we are in a winning position. But instead of he goes to Drona who was his teacher. That because it seems he felt that there is a soft spot. Drona is as powerful as Bheeshma and Arjuna in terms of his prowess in warfare.\n\nBut he knew that he has soft spot for his students. Every teacher has soft spot for his or her best student. Arjuna was Drona's best student. Not only that, all other people who are the great warriors on the other side are Drona's student. So he is now questioning whether he will be at his best when Drona fights this war. It seems therefore he goes to Drona and tells him look at the army on the Pandava side.\n\nIt is commanded by able commander like Drushtudumna, your wise student. Then he said all of them are your students. They know as much as you know or you are the one who trained them. So we have seen in the first six verses he describes who are on the Pandava side. Then the next six verses he described who are oversight. But now he is putting it in a way which seems slightly odd that he says Asmakam tu Visistha e Tanibhoda Dwijottama.\n\nHe addresses Drona as Dwijottama best among Brahmins. He is not here as a Brahmin. Here he is a warrior. And Drona, even though he was born a Brahmin spent his life in the art of warfare and he's the greatest teacher. That's why Bisma actually replaced Kripacharya who was supposed to be the Raj Guru. But he realized that Drona is a better teacher for his grandchildren all Kauravas and Pandavas.\n\nSo Drona was the best. But here Duryodhan goes to him and says oh, best among the Brahmin. It seems like a compliment but it's a backhanded compliment that look at the end of the day you're a Brahmin. And Brahmin are known to be softer. They can't tolerate physical or mental torture or agonies. There's a story in Mahbalabha Karna.\n\nKarna goes to a Parashuram and he wanted to learn. But he goes he's a Brahmin because Parshuram don't teach any else but Brahmins. Because Parasuram has taken vow that I'll wipe out all Kshatriyas from this planet. So Karna disguised himself as Brahmin and it went well. But one day Brahma was biting Karna's thigh and he started bleeding. His teacher was sleeping with his head on Karna's lap.\n\nThe blood starts going under Parasuram's head. So he feels this hot blood and he wakes up and he realizes that what happened. And he said, you are not a Brahmin. You cannot be a Brahmin if you can tolerate that much pain without moving. You are not a Brahmin. As we see from this story that Brahmins are known to be softer Dwyjottam after a soft person.\n\nSo I want you to see Asma Kamtu Vishishta. So be aware that even our side, the warriors are not ordinary warriors. They are better than normal. Nayaka Mama Sainyasya. The leaders in my army. See the words use a mama mamakah on one side.\n\nThat is the root cause of my problems. Nayaka Mama Sayinyasa sangnartan tan brahvimi te. I'm going to enumerate who are the special leaders in our army. There was no reason whatsoever for Drona to know any of this. He already knew it was not Drona's even business to worry about. He had his own position and a duties.\n\nBisma was the one who had to worry about who is where. But he is telling Drona he seemed suffering from anxiety where this war is winnable or not. And he's getting a little worried. So this is what happens when we go for presentation for our proposal we have submitted and we know there are three national firms we're competing against. Then we start looking what are our strong points? Look, our strong points is we are local then we are this and we are that.\n\nThis shows our anxiety. How are we going to win this thing when we are fighting a battle against mightier competitor. So here he is enumerating who are on my side to Drona, which shows his anxiety whether the war is winnable or not. Even though he had the larger army than the Pandavan. It also tells us that acquiring, accomplishing more things will not make me more secure which is how we live our life. More I'll acquire more secure I will be larger the bank balance I have more my retirement will be secured.\n\nIt's actually other way around. More I acquire an accomplice, more unsecure I become because my expectations from life becomes more and more more I start relying on my accomplishments and my achievements. I see long way to go to be perfect. So I was talking to my investment advisors. What is the guarantee that you will be able to protect my nest egg 20 years from now? There are no guarantees now.\n\nIf I never had that much money to worry about 20 years from now, who worries? Whatever it is, but because at least something that I worry about. So more I acquire, more insecure I become. That's the lesson we learn from this. So he's now insecure and now he says I'm going to enumerate what are our assets. These are our assets.\n\nWhat is our liability? Our liability is all your students on this side. But at the same token our assets. Bhavan, starting with you, you are one of my assets. Bhavan Bismast and also Bisma Karna Krupascha Samatinjaya Swamiji points out that he adds an adjective to Krupacharya Samatinjoya. Victorious Dronacharya knew who Krupacharya is.\n\nHe was his brother in law, you know, replaced by him as a teacher by Bheeshma. Now Duryoda is telling him he's the victorious one. Victorious Kripacharya. It shows his anxieties and worry and trying to make Dronacharya be more loyal and faithful to him. Asvathama his son, he knew asvathama Vikranscha, Soma Datta, Tatha, evacha. So he enumerated these people starting from you.\n\nHe wanted to make him feel like you are important. Just make sure that your loyalty is not divided between Pandavas and us. Because your students are there. Your best student is on other side. But I consider you as my asset. Then he continues and says, a Nyecha Baha vah Suraha, Madharte Takta, Jeevi taha.\n\nThere are many others, great warriors. They are willing to give their lives for me. So it's all about me. You can see in these verses. There's more mama in it than anything else. He's not describing anything which is of value to Drona.\n\nHe's not describing any strategy. Let's make sure that we all understood what our game plan is. He's just simply saying, look how we are in a better situation. Because I am at the center of this and everybody is fighting for me. They are ready to give their lives for me. Nana, Sastra, Prahananah, Sarvey, Yudda, Vishaaradaha.\n\nThey're all expert in weapons of various kinds and missiles. Something which you throw is a Prahana, a pariyaptam. So this verse is somewhat of a value to understand. A pariyaptam tat asmakam Balam Bisma vi raxitam pariyaptam Fidham etesham balam Bhima viraksitam. Now he gives his conclusion after evaluating who is in Pandava's side, who is on our side, what is our situation. So there are two interpretations Swamiji mentions here.\n\nStrength our army seems aa pariyaptam. So one interpretation, unlimited because so huge is protected by Bhaishma seems plenty. Pariyaptam tvidam ete sam Balam Bhima Bhiraxitam. And it seemed like the army protected by Bhima. I'm not exactly sure why not Drishtudumna Arjuna, but Bhima. The simple thing I can think of is Duryodhana's direct competition is Bhima.\n\nBecause both were Gada warriors. Bhima is someone to be worried about. So you think that this army protected by Bhima is Pariyaptami limited. It's not large enough. We are in a winning situation. Everyone who reads Bhagavad Gita comes up with his own interpretation.\n\nSo whether Bhagavad Gita teaches us the Advaita philosophy. Advaita philosophy or sister Advaita, depending Which Acharya you follow? All of them looked at Bhagavad Gita and came up with a conclusion. It stitches that even though Dhyana Shloka whoever wrote it says Advaita Amruta Varshinim Ashtadasa Dhvayinim clearly says it is showerer of the Advaita philosophy. The blessings of Advaita philosophy. But still we have a sister Advaita and Dvaita Interpretation of Bhagavad Gita.\n\nSo here one way to look at it. If he feels this is a winnable situation, he will say we have unlimited army. You know this is where the 711 comes is a perfect combination.",
      "reflection": "Consider a situation in your own life where you face conflicting duties—where doing right by one person or principle seems to require doing wrong by another. The Gita doesn't offer easy answers to such dilemmas, but it invites us to face them honestly rather than avoiding them.\n\nToday, notice if there's something you're choosing not to see because the truth would be uncomfortable. Dhritarashtra's tragedy wasn't his blindness—it was his refusal of sight when it was offered. What truths are you avoiding? What would happen if you faced them directly?\n\nThe battlefield isn't just Kurukshetra. It's wherever you are right now, facing whatever you're facing. And the question the Gita asks is the same one Dhritarashtra asked: What will you do?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter one, Arjuna Vishada Yoga Yoga of Arjuna's Grief. As we had discussed before, this is a chapter which gives us the context for the dialogue between Arjuna and Krishna. We have seen that Bhagavad Gita is part of the Prasthanatrei, one of the three legs of our philosophy, the Upanishads, Brahma Sutra and Bhagavad Gita. Bhagavad Gita has a unique place as we have discussed that it is not only a Shruti because it reveals the Brahma Vidya but it is also applicable for a day to day living a social order. Therefore it is also considered Smruti. So in that context we're seeing this chapter one as the study in comparison of how different people react to the same situation.\n\nSo we started this Bhagavad Gita with Dhritarashtra's query to Sanjaya what's happening at the battlefield? Dharmakshetra, Kurukshetra, Mamakaha, Pandavaschain. The very first thing we notice is how Dhritarashtra is thinking this world is divided into mine and yours, mine and rest of the world Mamakaha, mine and Pandava's. So this is the one issue which we deal with in philosophy that in our Advaita philosophy the root cause of all our problems is the duality. This duality which I have as I as an island by myself and then world is out there creates this friction between I and the world. So the very first indication, the first word is where we stand in this.\n\nWe are in the Dhrutrastra Sthiti. We see this world as I, mine and rest. And then as we further go into the chapter we see Sanjay's narration. Sanjaya starts his narration with what is Duryodhan doing? So we are seeing now the world from Duryodhan's perspective, same situation. The two armies are facing each other.\n\nWar is about to be started. We all know the background of why they are there very elaborately. The Mahabharata describes what happened before we came to this point of two armies facing each other. Now Duryodhan is looking at the situation. He sees the situation from a very different perspective. He sees from perspective whether the winnable or not winnable am I in a winning position or am I in a losing position?\n\nThe same situation as we say further in the chapter Arjuna looks at it very differently. He looks at it as whether right or wrong to be here. So it gives us various perspectives how we look at our lives when we face any situation depending on my own mental condition we look at the situation that way. Swamiji used to say the Scriptures are nothing but the mirror of our mind. Every time we read the Scriptures we see our own reflection in it. So we have seen that Sanjay first says that looking at the Pandavas army Raja Duryodhan went to Drona and told him thus.\n\nAnd then he discovered what he told Drona. First of all, as we know the commander in chief on Kaurava's side with Bheeshma Pandava side with Drishtudhumna, Drupad's son. So if Duryodhana had to go to anybody, if he had any question, doubt or explanation he should have gone to Visma and said let's make sure that we are in a winning position. But instead of he goes to Drona who was his teacher. That because it seems he felt that there is a soft spot. Drona is as powerful as Bheeshma and Arjuna in terms of his prowess in warfare.\n\nBut he knew that he has soft spot for his students. Every teacher has soft spot for his or her best student. Arjuna was Drona's best student. Not only that, all other people who are the great warriors on the other side are Drona's student. So he is now questioning whether he will be at his best when Drona fights this war. It seems therefore he goes to Drona and tells him look at the army on the Pandava side.\n\nIt is commanded by able commander like Drushtudumna, your wise student. Then he said all of them are your students. They know as much as you know or you are the one who trained them. So we have seen in the first six verses he describes who are on the Pandava side. Then the next six verses he described who are oversight. But now he is putting it in a way which seems slightly odd that he says Asmakam tu Visistha e Tanibhoda Dwijottama.\n\nHe addresses Drona as Dwijottama best among Brahmins. He is not here as a Brahmin. Here he is a warrior. And Drona, even though he was born a Brahmin spent his life in the art of warfare and he's the greatest teacher. That's why Bisma actually replaced Kripacharya who was supposed to be the Raj Guru. But he realized that Drona is a better teacher for his grandchildren all Kauravas and Pandavas.\n\nSo Drona was the best. But here Duryodhan goes to him and says oh, best among the Brahmin. It seems like a compliment but it's a backhanded compliment that look at the end of the day you're a Brahmin. And Brahmin are known to be softer. They can't tolerate physical or mental torture or agonies. There's a story in Mahbalabha Karna.\n\nKarna goes to a Parashuram and he wanted to learn. But he goes he's a Brahmin because Parshuram don't teach any else but Brahmins. Because Parasuram has taken vow that I'll wipe out all Kshatriyas from this planet. So Karna disguised himself as Brahmin and it went well. But one day Brahma was biting Karna's thigh and he started bleeding. His teacher was sleeping with his head on Karna's lap.\n\nThe blood starts going under Parasuram's head. So he feels this hot blood and he wakes up and he realizes that what happened. And he said, you are not a Brahmin. You cannot be a Brahmin if you can tolerate that much pain without moving. You are not a Brahmin. As we see from this story that Brahmins are known to be softer Dwyjottam after a soft person.\n\nSo I want you to see Asma Kamtu Vishishta. So be aware that even our side, the warriors are not ordinary warriors. They are better than normal. Nayaka Mama Sainyasya. The leaders in my army. See the words use a mama mamakah on one side.\n\nThat is the root cause of my problems. Nayaka Mama Sayinyasa sangnartan tan brahvimi te. I'm going to enumerate who are the special leaders in our army. There was no reason whatsoever for Drona to know any of this. He already knew it was not Drona's even business to worry about. He had his own position and a duties.\n\nBisma was the one who had to worry about who is where. But he is telling Drona he seemed suffering from anxiety where this war is winnable or not. And he's getting a little worried. So this is what happens when we go for presentation for our proposal we have submitted and we know there are three national firms we're competing against. Then we start looking what are our strong points? Look, our strong points is we are local then we are this and we are that.\n\nThis shows our anxiety. How are we going to win this thing when we are fighting a battle against mightier competitor. So here he is enumerating who are on my side to Drona, which shows his anxiety whether the war is winnable or not. Even though he had the larger army than the Pandavan. It also tells us that acquiring, accomplishing more things will not make me more secure which is how we live our life. More I'll acquire more secure I will be larger the bank balance I have more my retirement will be secured.\n\nIt's actually other way around. More I acquire an accomplice, more unsecure I become because my expectations from life becomes more and more more I start relying on my accomplishments and my achievements. I see long way to go to be perfect. So I was talking to my investment advisors. What is the guarantee that you will be able to protect my nest egg 20 years from now? There are no guarantees now.\n\nIf I never had that much money to worry about 20 years from now, who worries? Whatever it is, but because at least something that I worry about. So more I acquire, more insecure I become. That's the lesson we learn from this. So he's now insecure and now he says I'm going to enumerate what are our assets. These are our assets.\n\nWhat is our liability? Our liability is all your students on this side. But at the same token our assets. Bhavan, starting with you, you are one of my assets. Bhavan Bismast and also Bisma Karna Krupascha Samatinjaya Swamiji points out that he adds an adjective to Krupacharya Samatinjoya. Victorious Dronacharya knew who Krupacharya is.\n\nHe was his brother in law, you know, replaced by him as a teacher by Bheeshma. Now Duryoda is telling him he's the victorious one. Victorious Kripacharya. It shows his anxieties and worry and trying to make Dronacharya be more loyal and faithful to him. Asvathama his son, he knew asvathama Vikranscha, Soma Datta, Tatha, evacha. So he enumerated these people starting from you.\n\nHe wanted to make him feel like you are important. Just make sure that your loyalty is not divided between Pandavas and us. Because your students are there. Your best student is on other side. But I consider you as my asset. Then he continues and says, a Nyecha Baha vah Suraha, Madharte Takta, Jeevi taha.\n\nThere are many others, great warriors. They are willing to give their lives for me. So it's all about me. You can see in these verses. There's more mama in it than anything else. He's not describing anything which is of value to Drona.\n\nHe's not describing any strategy. Let's make sure that we all understood what our game plan is. He's just simply saying, look how we are in a better situation. Because I am at the center of this and everybody is fighting for me. They are ready to give their lives for me. Nana, Sastra, Prahananah, Sarvey, Yudda, Vishaaradaha.\n\nThey're all expert in weapons of various kinds and missiles. Something which you throw is a Prahana, a pariyaptam. So this verse is somewhat of a value to understand. A pariyaptam tat asmakam Balam Bisma vi raxitam pariyaptam Fidham etesham balam Bhima viraksitam. Now he gives his conclusion after evaluating who is in Pandava's side, who is on our side, what is our situation. So there are two interpretations Swamiji mentions here.\n\nStrength our army seems aa pariyaptam. So one interpretation, unlimited because so huge is protected by Bhaishma seems plenty. Pariyaptam tvidam ete sam Balam Bhima Bhiraxitam. And it seemed like the army protected by Bhima. I'm not exactly sure why not Drishtudumna Arjuna, but Bhima. The simple thing I can think of is Duryodhana's direct competition is Bhima.\n\nBecause both were Gada warriors. Bhima is someone to be worried about. So you think that this army protected by Bhima is Pariyaptami limited. It's not large enough. We are in a winning situation. Everyone who reads Bhagavad Gita comes up with his own interpretation.\n\nSo whether Bhagavad Gita teaches us the Advaita philosophy. Advaita philosophy or sister Advaita, depending Which Acharya you follow? All of them looked at Bhagavad Gita and came up with a conclusion. It stitches that even though Dhyana Shloka whoever wrote it says Advaita Amruta Varshinim Ashtadasa Dhvayinim clearly says it is showerer of the Advaita philosophy. The blessings of Advaita philosophy. But still we have a sister Advaita and Dvaita Interpretation of Bhagavad Gita.\n\nSo here one way to look at it. If he feels this is a winnable situation, he will say we have unlimited army. You know this is where the 711 comes is a perfect combination.",
      "reflection": "Consider a situation in your own life where you face conflicting duties—where doing right by one person or principle seems to require doing wrong by another. The Gita doesn't offer easy answers to such dilemmas, but it invites us to face them honestly rather than avoiding them.\n\nToday, notice if there's something you're choosing not to see because the truth would be uncomfortable. Dhritarashtra's tragedy wasn't his blindness—it was his refusal of sight when it was offered. What truths are you avoiding? What would happen if you faced them directly?\n\nThe battlefield isn't just Kurukshetra. It's wherever you are right now, facing whatever you're facing. And the question the Gita asks is the same one Dhritarashtra asked: What will you do?"

      "commentary": "We are now discussing chapter one Arjuna Vishada yoga yoga of Arjuna's grief in the first 12 verses we have seen so far that Dhritarashtra is very anxious to know what's happening with his sons and Pandu's sons. Mamakaha Pandavahachayam so in the very first verse we see the cause for this war. Dhritarashtra was the guardian after Pandu died for the Pandu's sons. So when you assign a guardian to take care of the children that guardian is responsible for the welfare and well being and also to protect the interest of those children. That's the job of a guardian. Dhritarashtra being the Emperor and the uncle of Pandu's sons Pandu assigned Dhritarashtra to take care of his sons.\n\nSo it was Dhritarashtra's duty to treat Pandu's as his own children because he was the guardian for those children and therefore he should have treated Pandusan as his own sons. But we clearly see how he had distinction in his mind between his sons and Pandu's sons. So very first one say Mama Kaha Panda Maha Chaya that is the cause for this conflict in life. We see that it's only when someone is not doing his or her job or his or her duty then only the conflict occurs. Conflicts are there because someone is assigned a duty is not doing it whether it is you or the other. Therefore you also have Dharmakshetra Kurukshetra here.\n\nThe goal for this war is to establish Dharma Again to re establish the Dharma. Conflict occurs because there is a violation of Dharma somewhere. Who is responsible One has to figure out then the next 11 verses. We have seen what's happening with three of them. The Dhritarashtra were very anxious to know what's going on because he obviously wasn't really sure. Duryodhana in a similar situation has his own doubts about the loyalty of his own people and the generals because he knew for sure that his cause is not validated by all his people, all the great generals in his army, he cannot feel comfortable.\n\nThey are completely loyal to him. Their loyalties may be divided. They are on my side because of their employment, that they are employed by the kingdom but their hearts may be on the other side. It is quite well known that Arjuna was Drona's favorite student. Bheeshma liked Pandavas more than the Kauravas, so he wasn't sure. So the cause of anxiety which we see here is my own failure to follow my own Dharma.\n\nSo all these 12 verses tell us that conflict only occurs when Dharma is violated and your peace of your mind is shattered only when Dharma is violated. When you don't follow your Dharma then your mental peace will be violated. So we see in Duryodhana that he's suffering from anxiety and his first target was Drona because it was quite obvious that Drona has soft corner for Arjuna in Pandava. So we have seen his behavior and he enumerates who are on their side and our side and seem like our army is enough or not enough. Now we are seeing Bisma. Bisma being the guardian of the Hastinapur's throne.\n\nNo matter what the situation is, he had the duty to keep the army motivated. So he realized that if he leaves this situation longer period of time not only Duryodhana is going down, but he's going to bring everybody else down with him. Drona and Prabhupada, whoever he is addressing to. So then we have seen in verse 12 he said Tasyas Sanjanayan Harsham to cheer them up to fight this battle. Sihanadam vinidya chahi Sankam dadmo pru tapuan. He roared like a lion and then blew his own conch.\n\nSo we have discussed last time the declaration of the war. Bheeshma has also come to the conclusion that this conflict can only be settled by this war. Dharma can only be established by just fighting this war. And therefore let's get it done. So he blew his own conch. And now we see the reaction, Quick response from everybody.\n\nAs soon as Bheeshma blew his own conch, everybody else blew their own conches. And there was a great sound where everybody playing their kettle drums and cow horns. Now there is a reason why army used to carry those kettle drums. We also know that the sound has its own effect. So when you go to disco, the beats on disco, as the yoga teacher will say, will activate your Muladhara chakra that will make you dance whether you Want to dance or not? As soon as the bit starts, you start dancing.\n\nSo the sound has its own effect in changing your mental makeup. So this great sound will put you into frenzy to do something. So that as soon as the leader has announced that we are ready, everybody else supported and said we are ready too. We have seen the response by the army. Now here interesting thing to note is Bhagavan Vedvyas does not enumerate all the Kauravas generals who blew their conscience. But he does enumerate the Pandavas Tathahas, Swetaihi Hayehi, Yukte Mahati, Syandanesh, Titao, Madhavah, Pandavah, Chayeva, Divya, Sankam, Pradhadvatuhu.\n\nThe very first response comes from Madhav seated in the great chariot yoked by white horses. Pandav Arjun Pandu's son. Pandav here is Arjun Divya, Sankhopra, Dhatma. They believe their own divine conscience. Bhagavan Vedvyas didn't say first. Drishtadhamna did that because he was the chief of the army.\n\nYudhishthir not an Arjun Madhavah. The one person who was really keen in establishing Dharma in Aryavarth was Krishna. He has concluded that this conflict cannot be settled. All the arrogance of Kauravas and their mistreatment to the people will only stop if they are stopped in their tracks. The only way to stop them is to have this war. So the first response actually came from Madhav who has decided he's not going to take up the arms.\n\nHe's like, I'm not fighting. So sometimes without fighting you can fight the battle. The lesson to be learned here is you don't have to be always actively making noise. You can be very silently win the war. Both Madhav and Pandav Arjuna with their own divine conscience Paguna Vedvyas seems pretty biased here. He didn't say divine thing on the other side, but he said the conscious were even divine.\n\nWhat it means is their cause was divine to fight this war. Their cause was not driven by their own arrogance or self interest. Their cause was driven by establishing Dharma Pancha, Janyam, Hrishikeshaha, Devadattam, Dhananjayaha, Panbram, Dadmo, Maha Sankham, Bhima, Karma, Vrukodaraha, Drishikesha. Lord Krishna blew his great Panchajanyam conch. So the conches were also named probably the sounds were unique from each other. So you can know whose conch is being blown.\n\nIt is more like, you know, I don't see that now, but when we were in Africa. So sitting in your apartment, you know whose car has come just by the noise, you know, the noise the car makes. You know, that must be Harish coming here. Oh, that sounds like Mazda. I think that Neel Kante from the sound of that, you can recognize who is that. So in this great war, you don't know who is where, but with your conch, you can let the other person know where you are.\n\nYour position can be determined by the sound of your conch. That's the way of communication. I think the yodeling in Scandinavia may be a way of communicating. So this conches were for communication. So each one has own signature conch sound. So they know who is where in this formation of this army, how far he is from Panchajanyam.\n\nHrishikesha Swamiji comments here that it was called Panchajannya because it was made of a demon called Panchajana. It seemed like there is some philosophical meaning. The conch which is Krishna is blowing was born out of a demon which is five attributes, five senses. Krishna blows his own conch. He works through conch which is made up of five senses. So it's Pancha Janyam Devadattam Arjunaska Devadattam.\n\nIndra gave him was a gift from his father. Indra Devadattam Dhananjayaha Pondra Dadmo Mahasankam Bhima Karma Vrukodaraha. It's a Vrukodara Bhima wolf bellied. Because he can eat as much as he wants, but he can still digest it like a wolf. Bhimakarma gonna play on his own name. The one who is capable of doing terrible deeds.\n\nHe blew his own great conch named Pondra. Anant Vijayam Raja Kuntiputra Yudhishthirah Kuntiputra Yudhishthir. He blew his own conch called Anant Vijay. Eternal victory because he is Dharmaraj. His victory is in establishing truth. And a truth has eternal victory.\n\nSo therefore his conscience goes. Ananta Vijayam, Nakulaha Sahadevas, Cha Sughosha Manipushpakah. Nakul and Sahadeva is also conscious and they reflect their own personality. Nakul was a fashionable one, therefore he's Su Ghosha.

So you can now see the LGBTQ is not our army's problem, military's problem.\n\nAnd they had the same issue whether Shikhandi can fight or not. But Pandavas were open minded. Shikhandi never changed his gender. He was born as a girl. And Drupad raised him as a girl. But allowed to fight in the army because they did not discriminate between who can fight in the army whether men or women.\n\nBut Shikhandi, from all accepted description he changed his gender. He was born as a girl. His mother raised her as a boy. Because Drupad wanted a son to fight Drona. But it turned out to be a girl. So he was raised as a son.\n\nAnd then at some point of time he leaves his house. Because after he got married it created a problem. So he leaves and then he changes his gender. As per Puranas he was Amba reborn as Shikhandini. His name is Shikhandini when he was a girl. And then because Shikhandi when he became a man, Drishtadumna, Drupada, other son Viratascha, Satyaki, Hitcha Aa Parajitaha.\n\nSatyaki was Krishna's charioteer. Krishna gave his army to Duryodhana. But not all the general decided to join. Some of them decided they cannot have their army. But they are not going to fight there. Satyagi was one of them.\n\nHe decided to fight from a Pandava side. We know the story of Virat Drishta Dhumna. His only goal in life is to kill Drona to take his father's revenge. So you see, Shikhandi's goal is to kill Bheeshma, Drastha, Dhamna, Drana. So they are mentioned here that they are there as Drona and Bisma on the tide. The two people who are dying to kill them are on this side.\n\nDrupadhao, Draupadaya, Sarvasah, Truthivi, Pate and then all the other people. Prithvipada, Prithvipadhya here is addressed to Dhritarashtra no King Drupad and Draupadi's children and Saubhadra's children Mahabahuhu the great warriors. They also blew their Sankhan, Dadmuhu, Prathak Pratak. They blew their own conches differently. Blowing our own conscience is like expressing own opinion. Everyone has to have their own opinion.\n\nSo when we are in a meeting somewhere, if you are not having a chance to have your own opinion, that meeting is worthless for you. Everyone has to express their own opinion. Now if everybody is doing it in an orderly manner, it makes sense. But everybody is doing it at the same time.

      "commentary": "We are now discussing chapter one Arjuna Vishada yoga yoga of Arjuna's grief in the first 12 verses we have seen so far that Dhritarashtra is very anxious to know what's happening with his sons and Pandu's sons. Mamakaha Pandavahachayam so in the very first verse we see the cause for this war. Dhritarashtra was the guardian after Pandu died for the Pandu's sons. So when you assign a guardian to take care of the children that guardian is responsible for the welfare and well being and also to protect the interest of those children. That's the job of a guardian. Dhritarashtra being the Emperor and the uncle of Pandu's sons Pandu assigned Dhritarashtra to take care of his sons.\n\nSo it was Dhritarashtra's duty to treat Pandu's as his own children because he was the guardian for those children and therefore he should have treated Pandusan as his own sons. But we clearly see how he had distinction in his mind between his sons and Pandu's sons. So very first one say Mama Kaha Panda Maha Chaya that is the cause for this conflict in life. We see that it's only when someone is not doing his or her job or his or her duty then only the conflict occurs. Conflicts are there because someone is assigned a duty is not doing it whether it is you or the other. Therefore you also have Dharmakshetra Kurukshetra here.\n\nThe goal for this war is to establish Dharma Again to re establish the Dharma. Conflict occurs because there is a violation of Dharma somewhere. Who is responsible One has to figure out then the next 11 verses. We have seen what's happening with three of them. The Dhritarashtra were very anxious to know what's going on because he obviously wasn't really sure. Duryodhana in a similar situation has his own doubts about the loyalty of his own people and the generals because he knew for sure that his cause is not validated by all his people, all the great generals in his army, he cannot feel comfortable.\n\nThey are completely loyal to him. Their loyalties may be divided. They are on my side because of their employment, that they are employed by the kingdom but their hearts may be on the other side. It is quite well known that Arjuna was Drona's favorite student. Bheeshma liked Pandavas more than the Kauravas, so he wasn't sure. So the cause of anxiety which we see here is my own failure to follow my own Dharma.\n\nSo all these 12 verses tell us that conflict only occurs when Dharma is violated and your peace of your mind is shattered only when Dharma is violated. When you don't follow your Dharma then your mental peace will be violated. So we see in Duryodhana that he's suffering from anxiety and his first target was Drona because it was quite obvious that Drona has soft corner for Arjuna in Pandava. So we have seen his behavior and he enumerates who are on their side and our side and seem like our army is enough or not enough. Now we are seeing Bisma. Bisma being the guardian of the Hastinapur's throne.\n\nNo matter what the situation is, he had the duty to keep the army motivated. So he realized that if he leaves this situation longer period of time not only Duryodhana is going down, but he's going to bring everybody else down with him. Drona and Prabhupada, whoever he is addressing to. So then we have seen in verse 12 he said Tasyas Sanjanayan Harsham to cheer them up to fight this battle. Sihanadam vinidya chahi Sankam dadmo pru tapuan. He roared like a lion and then blew his own conch.\n\nSo we have discussed last time the declaration of the war. Bheeshma has also come to the conclusion that this conflict can only be settled by this war. Dharma can only be established by just fighting this war. And therefore let's get it done. So he blew his own conch. And now we see the reaction, Quick response from everybody.\n\nAs soon as Bheeshma blew his own conch, everybody else blew their own conches. And there was a great sound where everybody playing their kettle drums and cow horns. Now there is a reason why army used to carry those kettle drums. We also know that the sound has its own effect. So when you go to disco, the beats on disco, as the yoga teacher will say, will activate your Muladhara chakra that will make you dance whether you Want to dance or not? As soon as the bit starts, you start dancing.\n\nSo the sound has its own effect in changing your mental makeup. So this great sound will put you into frenzy to do something. So that as soon as the leader has announced that we are ready, everybody else supported and said we are ready too. We have seen the response by the army. Now here interesting thing to note is Bhagavan Vedvyas does not enumerate all the Kauravas generals who blew their conscience. But he does enumerate the Pandavas Tathahas, Swetaihi Hayehi, Yukte Mahati, Syandanesh, Titao, Madhavah, Pandavah, Chayeva, Divya, Sankam, Pradhadvatuhu.\n\nThe very first response comes from Madhav seated in the great chariot yoked by white horses. Pandav Arjun Pandu's son. Pandav here is Arjun Divya, Sankhopra, Dhatma. They believe their own divine conscience. Bhagavan Vedvyas didn't say first. Drishtadhamna did that because he was the chief of the army.\n\nYudhishthir not an Arjun Madhavah. The one person who was really keen in establishing Dharma in Aryavarth was Krishna. He has concluded that this conflict cannot be settled. All the arrogance of Kauravas and their mistreatment to the people will only stop if they are stopped in their tracks. The only way to stop them is to have this war. So the first response actually came from Madhav who has decided he's not going to take up the arms.\n\nHe's like, I'm not fighting. So sometimes without fighting you can fight the battle. The lesson to be learned here is you don't have to be always actively making noise. You can be very silently win the war. Both Madhav and Pandav Arjuna with their own divine conscience Paguna Vedvyas seems pretty biased here. He didn't say divine thing on the other side, but he said the conscious were even divine.\n\nWhat it means is their cause was divine to fight this war. Their cause was not driven by their own arrogance or self interest. Their cause was driven by establishing Dharma Pancha, Janyam, Hrishikeshaha, Devadattam, Dhananjayaha, Panbram, Dadmo, Maha Sankham, Bhima, Karma, Vrukodaraha, Drishikesha. Lord Krishna blew his great Panchajanyam conch. So the conches were also named probably the sounds were unique from each other. So you can know whose conch is being blown.\n\nIt is more like, you know, I don't see that now, but when we were in Africa. So sitting in your apartment, you know whose car has come just by the noise, you know, the noise the car makes. You know, that must be Harish coming here. Oh, that sounds like Mazda. I think that Neel Kante from the sound of that, you can recognize who is that. So in this great war, you don't know who is where, but with your conch, you can let the other person know where you are.\n\nYour position can be determined by the sound of your conch. That's the way of communication. I think the yodeling in Scandinavia may be a way of communicating. So this conches were for communication. So each one has own signature conch sound. So they know who is where in this formation of this army, how far he is from Panchajanyam.\n\nHrishikesha Swamiji comments here that it was called Panchajannya because it was made of a demon called Panchajana. It seemed like there is some philosophical meaning. The conch which is Krishna is blowing was born out of a demon which is five attributes, five senses. Krishna blows his own conch. He works through conch which is made up of five senses. So it's Pancha Janyam Devadattam Arjunaska Devadattam.\n\nIndra gave him was a gift from his father. Indra Devadattam Dhananjayaha Pondra Dadmo Mahasankam Bhima Karma Vrukodaraha. It's a Vrukodara Bhima wolf bellied. Because he can eat as much as he wants, but he can still digest it like a wolf. Bhimakarma gonna play on his own name. The one who is capable of doing terrible deeds.\n\nHe blew his own great conch named Pondra. Anant Vijayam Raja Kuntiputra Yudhishthirah Kuntiputra Yudhishthir. He blew his own conch called Anant Vijay. Eternal victory because he is Dharmaraj. His victory is in establishing truth. And a truth has eternal victory.\n\nSo therefore his conscience goes. Ananta Vijayam, Nakulaha Sahadevas, Cha Sughosha Manipushpakah. Nakul and Sahadeva is also conscious and they reflect their own personality. Nakul was a fashionable one, therefore he's Su Ghosha. He's not really interested whether everybody gets excited about Fighting this war. But very sweet sounding Conchosha, Manipus and decorated jewel was Sahadev.\n\nOne was a fashion icon, another was the Joshi was also horse expert. So their conscience also reflect their personalities. Kashi, Paul, Param, Eswasah, Sikandicha, Maharathaha, Drishtadumnaha, Viratascha, Satyaki, Hecha Aa Parajita and all others. Such as the King of Kashi who is great archer, Shikhandi. Shikhandi was the transgender. So you can now see the LGBTQ is not our army's problem, military's problem.\n\nAnd they had the same issue whether Shikhandi can fight or not. But Pandavas were open minded. Shikhandi never changed his gender. He was born as a girl. And Drupad raised him as a girl.

He was born as a girl. His mother raised her as a boy. Because Drupad wanted a son to fight Drona. But it turned out to be a girl. So he was raised as a son.\n\nAnd then at some point of time he leaves his house. Because after he got married it created a problem. So he leaves and then he changes his gender. As per Puranas he was Amba reborn as Shikhandini. His name is Shikhandini when he was a girl. And then because Shikhandi when he became a man, Drishtadumna, Drupada, other son Viratascha, Satyaki, Hitcha Aa Parajitaha.\n\nSatyaki was Krishna's charioteer. Krishna gave his army to Duryodhana.

      "commentary": "We are now discussing chapter one, Arjuna Visadhi Yoga Yoga of Arjuna's Grief. So in the first 18 verses we have seen what is the situation with Dhritarashtra and what is the situation with Duryodhan in how Bisma reacted and how the Pandavas reacted. So what we are basically seeing here is anytime someone speaks, we can see his mental state. Unless somebody speaks, we will not know what's going on. So up till now we have seen the very first verse. We have seen Dhritarashtra state of mind.\n\nThe Dhritara state of mind is Mamakaha Pandabah. His world is divided between mine and others. Even his own brother's children who he has raised, he does not consider them to be mind. So we know now that this division in our mind about this duality of I and mine in the world which is outside of me creates the conflict. All the conflicts as we have discussed are there because of this sense of duality and then not following our own Dharma. Had Dhritarashtra followed his Dharma, we wouldn't have this war.\n\nSo Bhagavan Vedhi Vyas is now painting the picture of how different people are situated in this Mahabharata. As we have heard many times before that all the characters and situations that we encounter in life are already there in the Mahabharata. It is said that if it is not in Mahabharata, it is not worth even knowing or mentioning. So the situation we encounter in our life are already somewhere depicted in Mahabharata. So here up till now we have seen that first Dhritarashtra said what he wanted to say. And we now know that his world is divided into mind and Pandavas.\n\nThat's how he saw the world. Then we have seen Sanjay narrating what's happening in the battlefield. Sanjay was the most loyal advisor to Dhritarashtra. He will obviously will never go against Dhritarashtra or anything that will hurt Dhritarashtra. As we know from Mahabharata that even when Dhritarashtra left for the forest after Mahabharata the war Sanjay went with him. He was there till they were caught into the forest fire.\n\nAnd I think Dhritarashtra asked him to leave. So he leaves and saves himself. But Dhritarashtra and Gandhari decided they are not going to leave. So he was there till the end of his life. But the Sanjay was not the yes man. As somebody said if you hire the next guy don't hire a yes man, you will be in trouble.\n\nSo Sanjay was a loyal advisor but not a yes man. So therefore he gave the narration of what's happening as he saw. So as we have seen the first he says how the Duryodhan acted in that situation. He wasn't all confident. He was evaluating what is the strength of each armies whether it's good enough or not good enough. And then we have seen that Bhishma declared the war and Pandavas responded.\n\nBut the leader of the Pandavas responding was not one of the General but Madhava himself. The Krishna himself responded first. Krishna had already decided there is no other way but to fight this war to settle the score. So Krishna responded and all Pandavas followed enthusiastically. So you can see that the Pandavas are enthusiastic and confident about their own ability and in their cause. It also gives us an indication.\n\nAs long as you are sure about the cause of your pursuits you will be confident. And then we have seen the reaction from Gaurava's side which Sanjay narrates. It's not that we are adding anything here but he never said anything about what happened in the Pandavas side. He only said what's happened on the Dhritarashtra side. And he said this great sound which reverberated between the earth and the sky made the hearts of the people in Dhritarashtra army shiver. He didn't say that for the Pandavas.\n\nGiving indication that if you're not sure about your cause any obstacle will make you unsettled. You will not be then sure about whether this is the right thing to do or not. On Pandava's side Sanjay has not given that indication. He saw only the enthusiastic response to Bismar's call for the war. So we can take few takeaways from here. As long as you're sure about your pursuits no matter what the obstacle would be you will be confident about it and you will pursue your path towards your goal.\n\nIf you're not sure even the smallest obstacle will make you rethink Whether it's the right thing to do, am I really putting my energy in the right place? Will I be able to win this situation? Bhagavan Ved Vyas through Sanjaya's narration is painting this picture of how things work. When we are facing this battle of life, after everyone has expressed their opinion by blowing their own conch, then in life each one has to have their own opinion. No matter what other people have said. Sankaan Dadmohu Prathak Prithak each one has to say I support it, I support it or I don't support it.\n\nSo one who is not saying anything, we know that he's in the fence. But each one gave their own opinion that I support this pursuit. On Pandava's side we are not seeing that on Kaurava's side Sanjay wants to give the correct report to Dhritarashtra because he is the king. And maybe Bhagavan Ved Vyas had a little bias because Bhagawan Ved Vyas in the beginning wanted to stop this war by convincing Dhritarashtra and the last ditch efforts. But it obviously did not work. So with that Sagoso Dhartra Rashtranam Rudhyani Vridharayat Nabhastrimim Cha Eva Tumuloho Vyanunadayan that sound which reverberated between the sky and the earth made the hearts of the Dhritarashtra army.\n\nShiva Athavt Vyabasthitan Dristva Dharatra Rastra and Kapid Dhvajah Pravrute Sastra Sampate Dhanuhu Udyamya Pandavah. Sanjay now focuses on Arjuna. We have learned from Mahabharata. Sanjay had this unique vision that not only he can see things, but he can also read people's minds and he can see even things in this. In fact I had read some, even though I have not read Mahabharata that before this war starts, the Sanjaya's vision was tested by the Bhagavan Vedvyasa Dhritarashtra one of them where Sanjay describes the distant land which he had never visited before and the people and the culture and all the fauna and flora of the land. So he had this great ability to see things which are not within his normal perception.\n\nSo now he's focusing on Arjuna saying what is Arjuna doing? What he's saying Thus having seen the army of Kaurava arranged in formation Kapid Dvajah. His chariot was called Kapid Dvaja. His emblem on his Flag was Hanuman. Hanuman was very devoted to Bhagavan Ramachandra. Therefore he said, in any age, at any time, where there is Rama, I will be there.\n\nKrishna being Rama's incarnation, Hanman is always there when Krishna is fighting a battle. Arjuna's chariot is called Kapidwaja. Thus, having seen the Kavurava's army now arraigned in formation, Pravrutti Sastra Sampa de All the weapons are ready to be charged Now Dhanuhu Udhyyamya, he picked up his bow, so now he's getting ready. Here Sanjay addresses Dhritarashtra as Mahipate, O Lord of the Earth. Having seen that Arjuna said this to Rishikesha Krishna. Now Arjuna Vacha, anytime somebody speaks or opens his mouth, we know what's going on in his mind.\n\nThat's why we have this fear of public speaking. Because as long as I keep my mouth shut, you don't know what's going on. Am I a Democrat or Republican or Independent as soon as I open my mouth. But these days you can also see what channel he's watching. You are saying MSNBC or Fox Channel. So up till now Arjun has not said anything.\n\nHe just blew his conch. So we know he is very confident, he is very enthusiastic. I wouldn't call him arrogant, I would call him very confident in his pursuit, in what he is going to do and his ability. He picks up his bow, Ready, I am ready and capable. And then he said, arjuna vacha senayoho ubayoho madhya Ratham stapaya me Achuta O Achyta, Locate this chariot in the midst of the two armies, right in the middle of the two armies. But he addresses Krishna Achita, one who never wavers from his position.\n\nSwamiji reminds us here that this is the iconic image we have of Krishna and Arjuna in the chariot. And this reminds people who are students of Upanishads, the parable of Ratha in Katha Upanishad, that this body is the chariot and the atma is the rider. And this Buddhi is the charioteer. The mind is the reins and the senses are the horses. And the sense objects pave the path for the chariot to move. The sense objects create the path, senses are running on that path, mind is the rain.\n\nBut in the hands of Buddhi, along with this senses, the rider becomes the enjoyer of the ego. So ego is the rider and the senses are drawing this chariot towards the sense objects. And as long as that Buddhi is pure and in control. The chariot will be in control. If the Buddhi is not purified, it will let the senses go in the wrong direction. So here Arjuna tells Krishna that put my chariot right in the middle of the two armies.\n\nBecause Yavat etan nirikshay Aham Yudhu Kaman Avasthita Kairmaya Saha Yudhavyam Asmin Rana Samudya. Because I want to see who are desirous to fight in this battle. I want to make sure that I know whom I am fighting. It's basically a due diligence. Anytime we have to go for an interview, the first thing might Neil, did you find out who are we competing against? I said I never asked that question because half the time they don't give that answer.\n\nBut we are very curious to see who we are competing against. I'm sure Arjuna knew, but he wanted to make sure. Let's see the very first day who are there? Dhartra Rashtra Se Durbudehe Yudde Priya Chikir Savah. I want to see those who are assembled here to fight, wishing to please in the battle. The evil minded son of Dhritarashtra.\n\nWe now see the Arjuna state of mind, very confident and he has great animosity toward Duryodhana. He evil minded son of Duryodhan. He also knows that the people who are there not because they're fighting a righteous battle, they just want to please Duryodhana. That's why they are there. Because Duryodhana has the power. He is the person who is in charge of the entire empire.\n\nAnd they want to be in his good grace, in his good books. And therefore they are there. So let me see who those people are which I'll be fighting. It's basically as simple as that. What we have seen so far.",

He's basically giving us the mental status of each main character in this conflict. We've seen Dhritarashtra first, then we have seen Duryodhana, then we have seen Arjuna. And then we have also seen that Arjuna told Krishna that Take my chariot and place it in the middle of the two armies. So what we have seen so far is both Arjuna and Duryodhana are having strong egos.\n\nOne had negative qualities associated with the ego, others positive qualities associated with the ego. That's the only difference. Therefore we see Arjuna commanding or giving order to Krishna, saying place my chariot in the middle of the two armies. How do you know that the Arjuna had a big ego? But we also seen in Mahabharata Arjuna was the one who objected to compete with Karna. He says Sutaputra I will not compete with him.\n\nWhen they had this competition, that's what Duryodhan gave Karna kingdom of Angadish. So he became Angaraj Because Duryodhan see an opportunity having someone equivalent to Karna Arjuna in his own side. That's how Arkarna became Duryodhana's best friend. Yotsamana avekhse aham. I want to see ya eta itra sama Gataha the people who are gathered here. Dhartra rashtra syedurbuddehe yudde priyachi kir savah.\n\nThose who are gathered here just to please this evil minded Duryodhana. The very words shows his anger, hatred and his own ego. At this point he sees the army on the other side is one homogeneous mass of evil. Because their leader is evil, Duryodhana is evil and all who are gathered on that side are just there to please Duryodhana there is no other motive. Arjuna can see this is the entire army. On the other side is nothing but people with evil intentions.\n\nThey are either themselves an evil or they're just supporting evil for whatever the personal gain or whatever the personal opinion. And now we hear from Sanjay. He gives a very unbiased commentary. He is a commentator just like our news. People claim that all always give is the news. We are not news ourselves.\n\nWe are not putting our coloring. Sanjaya, Vaacha, Evam, Uktva, Hrushikeshah, Guda, Keshena. This is what told by Arjuna to Hrishikesha. Hrishikesha is the one who has the control of the senses. That's one interpretation. Other is the one who has the short hair Gudakesha, one who has the control over sleep on his conquered sleep.\n\nSwamiji says that there is no real proof in Mahabharata in Arjuna's biography that he has conquered sleep. The Western scholars said they won with the hair in bundles. Hair in style bundles. Obviously in India we have not seen that hairstyle. But here we can see the African Americans have hair in bundles. So it's possible that Vedvyas Bhagavan is just saying what they look like and not have this deeper meaning.\n\nWe have a tendency to find deeper meaning in everything we see in our scriptures. In my first year of architecture there will be simple tasks like design a handle for a window or a doorknob. And then we obviously have very complicated design because otherwise how are you going to impress your teacher? So we have tendency to complicate things and see things in a way that it seems so deep in. It is possible that Bhagawan Vidvya said this is how these two people look. So having spoken by Arjuna to Krishna.\n\nOh, Bharata Bharada here is addressed to Dhritarashtra because he was the king of Bharatkand. It has been said that Kuru dynasty was the first to organize the society in a statewide society. So Bharata, you are the king of this Bharat Khan Senayoho Ubhayoho Madhya Sapayitva Rathautamam. So we have the confirmation from Sanjay that Krishna followed the order thus ordered by Arjuna. Krishna placed the chariot in the middle of the two armies. Bisma Drona, Pramukhataha, Sarve Samcha, Mahikshitam, Vacha Partha Pasheta, Samavetaan, Kurunithi.\n\nHe put it right in front of Bhishma in Drona. He could have put right in front of Duryodhana. And then he said the first sentence uttered by Krishna in Bhagavad Gita. The only time we hear indirectly from Sanjay, otherwise we hear his direct words Sirik Bhagavan, O Vacha. But his Sanjay says what Krishna said to Arjuna. Pasheta, make sure you see all the gurus who are gathered here.\n\nLook at Vishwa and Drona and other kings, but also see all the gurus gathered here. Because what was Arjuna's intention? He just wanted to see who are against him. He wanted to see who are gathered here to please this evil Duryodhana. He very clearly said, that's all I want to see. I want to make sure that I understand who I'm fighting with.\n\nTherefore Krishna put him right in front of the Bhishma Dranada. It's not the homogeneous mass of evil that you're facing that once you wipe out that evil, things will be just well and good. There won't be any problems, no side effects. Everything will be just good. So this is how we also save the world. We think that if we eradicate the evil from this world, well, we have learnt in last few years, eradicating anything doesn't solve anything unless the cause for the evil is eradicated.\n\nJust eradicating the other side completely will not solve the problem. It may create more problems, but you have to be prepared for that. You should know what you are dealing with. Therefore he put Arjuna's cherry right in the Bhishma and Drona because they are clearly not part of evil. But the more important he said, see all the Kurus who are gathered here. Arjuna himself was a Kuru.\n\nHe was the descendant of the Kuru dynasty. Both Gauravas and Pandavas are descendants of Kurt dynasty. Up till now we have heard Arjuna referring to Kaurava as Dhartrastranam, Dhritarashtra's sons. His animosity was against Dhritarashtra's son, not against Kuru. Therefore, in the previous time when Arjuna has fought with even Bhishma, there was not really big problem. Basically protecting Virat's kingdom and he fought with Bheeshma.\n\nHe didn't have any problem fighting with Bheeshma before. Obviously he didn't try to kill him, but we couldn't kill him anyway. But this time Krishna says, look at all the Kurus. Don't only look at Dhrutrastra's putra. He gives him instruction indirectly. Make sure that you are aware that all your family members are involved on both sides in the next two verses.\n\nTatra apasyat, sthitan, parthah, pitru, Nathaha, pita, Mahan, acharya, matulan, bhrartran, putran, patran, sakimsthata. So now he is obviously observing on both sides that he doesn't see just the evil and good divided by the line. This is what we do in our life. We divide this world of liking and disliking with an imaginary line in my mind that if I can avoid this which I don't like, the world will be nothing. My life will be nothing but pure happiness. Well, we tend to forget that those are intertwined with each other.\n\nThe world which I like and world which I don't like, they intertwined with each other. So some of us in elections are party line voters because we clearly see that this side is a side of good, that side is side of not so good. It's only when you find out that the world is not as clearly divided into good and evil as we like to think. In our childhood we had it's very simple who are bad people, who are good people, cowboys and Indians. But world is not like that. Krishna wants to make sure the Arjuna understands that.\n\nThere is also another implication which we heard from lots of commentators that as we have seen that Arjuna's words indicate he has a big ego. Big ego doesn't mean the person is necessarily bad. Good people have big egos. Artists have big egos, architects have big egos. It's actually said in our profession, unless there are any Gita, it's generally said in our profession that you can't have two architects in the same room. Their egos are so big that no room in this world is large enough to contain two egos of the two architects at the same time.\n\nI learned hard way that when we collaborate with other firms, two architects collaborate with each other and it's a lesson in humility. I was fortunate enough to get this lesson very early on in my career when I came here. So when I was in Dallas, when I first came and working with a very large firm, WZMH somewhat specialized in high rise. And we were collaborating IM Pei, an international architect and he was a design architect. WZMH was just basically an architect of record. So I asked my boss, I said Mark, we are capable to design this project and we had the relationship with the developer, why do we have to bring in Im Pei in the mix?\n\nAnd he said, Neil, 100% of zero is still zero. If you want the whole enchilada, but you're not going to get it. He said you didn't get anything. Is it better to have a portion of an enchilada to devise a situation where at least you have a portion of the pie? So by myself I won't get that project. By themselves, they won't get the project.\n\nWell, let's compromise and say look, we can share this and we have to control our ego. If we share this, then we both get something out of it. So the people with big egos are bipolar in nature. So they go from supreme courage to complete vulnerability in one moment. If they see the world from this side, they will be very courageous. And when they see the competition, they see their own shortcoming.\n\nThey will break down very easily. So Krishna saw that Arjuna is overconfident. He thinks he's the best archer in the world. He has fought Bismar before. He has done all these people. There is nothing which can stop me from wiping out this sea of evil which I see in front of me.\n\nBut he had to be brought to his senses and brought to humility so that he is really prepared to fight this war. So Krishna said, now look at the Bisma, Drona, all other kings and all the crews, all the Kurus include all the people on his side as well. Now Arjuna sees all the people and individually recognize what his relationship with them. Tatra, Apasyat, Parthaha, Pitrunatha, fatherly relatives, Pita Mahan, also grandfatherly relatives, Acharyan, teachers, Mathulan, maternal relatives, Bratan, Putran, Pautran, Sakimstatha. Both sides he says people who are like his sons and also his grandsons, friends, Tatha, Swasuran, Sruhada, Chaeeva, also in laws, the people who are close to you. Now we have confirmation then not only he looked at the Kaurava's army, he also looked at Pandava's army.\n\nHe saw all the people who are dear to him, close to him, related to him. There is no indication he sees evil here. He didn't say oh, I also see Duryodhani. All he saw is the people who are related to him, were closer to him, were dear to him. And therefore he says Krupaya Pariya Vishtaha, Visidantam Idam Abravit. He thus sorrowfully filled with deep pity said this Swamiji says that Sanjay is actually generous in calling him as a deep pity Swamiji actually says that he may be broken down by his own insecurities.\n\nNow he realized that the world is not divided into evil and good, but a mixture of both on all sides. Things which we consider evil and lots of good in it and things we consider good has some evil in it.",
      "reflection": "Consider a situation in your own life where you face conflicting duties—where doing right by one person or principle seems to require doing wrong by another. The Gita doesn't offer easy answers to such dilemmas, but it invites us to face them honestly rather than avoiding them.\n\nToday, notice if there's something you're choosing not to see because the truth would be uncomfortable. Dhritarashtra's tragedy wasn't his blindness—it was his refusal of sight when it was offered. What truths are you avoiding? What would happen if you faced them directly?\n\nThe battlefield isn't just Kurukshetra. It's wherever you are right now, facing whatever you're facing. And the question the Gita asks is the same one Dhritarashtra asked: What will you do?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter one, Arjuna Vishada Yoga, Yoga of Arjuna's Grief. So we had been seeing various characters involved in this Mahabharata. It reminds me of something I had read somewhere in our scriptural literature which says Yat Pinde Tat Brahmande. That which is at this microcosm is at the macrocosm. If I find something in me, I'll be able to find in the cosmos. The master plan for the microcosm and macrocosm is just one and the same.\n\nSo if I find something in macrocosm, I should also be able to find in microcosm, at my individual level, the efficient cause and material cause for the universe. The same efficient cause and material cause for me. Therefore, if I can observe something in the universe, I can also apply that to my own life. Something similar is being said for Mahabharata. As we have discussed before, Mahabharata contains all human situations and characters. So if I find a character in Mahabharata, and if I introspect very carefully, I'll find that character in me too, in my own personality.\n\nLet me find Dhritarashtra in me. Blinded by attachment to his children, he cannot see what is right and wrong when it comes to his children. I can also probably find Duryodhana in me. That Duryodhana, he wanted to keep something which came accidentally to him, but he now doesn't want to give it up. Many Internet millionaires in late 90s and early 2000s, what they went through afterwards, actually know one person in particular who made millions in this technology. And once he got out of that, he made all his efforts to retain that and failed miserably.\n\nThat's Duryodhana, Nina. Something came to us accidentally, but I don't want to give it up. We also want Bhishma in US who is very rigidly following the rules but ignoring the principles. When it comes to paying taxes, we are more like Bhishma. If I can find that I meet the IRS criteria in not paying any taxes, even though I am A multi billion dollar corporation, that's perfectly legal. But I completely forget the principle of paying taxes.\n\nIt's for the social welfare. If I don't pay anything, I'm not contributing anything to the social welfare. So I may find Bhishma in me who is rigidly following the rules but forgetting the principles. I may find Arjuna in me who is very keen on overcoming the obstacles which are in his path of his happiness, what we think is rightfully his. He wants to get over those obstacles. In this case, Duryodhana.\n\nDuryodhana is in his path of finding that happiness, of getting that kingdom back. We have all enthusiasm to march forward towards our success. And if there is anything in our way, going to get rid of it. But we hope that we also find Krishna in us who says, well, look at it comprehensively. So Krishna said, look at all these people. All the Kurus are gathered here not only on the other side, but also on your side.\n\nThe Kurus on your side too. Look at them basically reminding, look at the situation, what you're trying to achieve. How many people have to make what kind of sacrifices for you to achieve your own goal? In our enthusiasm to achieve success and move forward in our life, we completely forget how many people are making sacrifices for us on our own side. From our family, from your friends, from your relative. Lots of people have to do a lot of things so that I can move forward in my life.\n\nThat is one point we forget to acknowledge. We never say thank you to people who supported us, who brought me to this level. But we also, I am a self made man. I came here with $8 in my pocket. I'm not sure that the young generation understands. My generation understands.\n\nIndia used to have restriction that only you can take $8 in foreign exchange when you leave India. So people very proudly say, I came with $8 and look at what I accomplished. We forget to acknowledge what my parents did to get to the point where I can take the $8 and come here. So Krishna reminds us that look at on all sides. Make sure that you understand that lots of people have to make lots of sacrifices for you to come to a point where you are capable of overcoming the obstacles which you perceive as the obstacles in the path of happiness. The message we get here is not only that we should introspect negative in us, but also we should introspect and find that Krishna's voice in us.\n\nThen see what is the guidance here. Arjuna now sees the situation in its totality. He looks at how many people are gathered Here and the impact on him is what we are now seeing from Sanjay's description. So Sanjaya says, Krupaya Paraya Vistaha Visidhan Idham Abhravit. Overwhelmed by great compassion or pity, he sorrowfully said this. So Sanjaya says by observing who are gathered on both sides that Arjuna came over with immense pity or compassion.\n\nBut he's sorrowful that I'm not going to achieve the goal I came here to achieve. I came here to eliminate the evil of Duryodhana, then establish the kingdom which is rightfully ours. So he is now conflicted about whether it is good for him to continue or it will be very noble of him to walk away from the situation. We see this situation many times. The student is very bright and he wants to go to Harvard. Then he realizes family has to make the sacrifice the family cannot afford.\n\nCome from a poor family. They say it will be okay, I'll go to community college. Out of the compassion for his family members. So Bhagavan says, well look at is this the situation here? So we hear from Arjuna. I say Dristwa Imam Swajanam K Krishna Yuyutsum Sam Upasthitam by seeing all the dear ones gathered here and eager to fight.\n\nSiddhanti Mama Gatrani My limbs are failing me. I am the mightiest warrior but I don't have any strength. Mukham Chav Parishati My mouth is drying up, my body shivering. I'm having goosebumps. I'm overwhelmed by fear, very fearful. Then I have a goosebump or too excited when I get goosebumps.\n\nSo in this verse he describes his physical condition. And the medical professionals in the room will say, well that's a nervous breakdown situation. So Arjuna basically had the symptoms of nervous brain. The next verse says Gandhivam Sansrate Hasta TV Nacha saknomi avasthatum Brahmati evacham me Manaha that I can even hold my bow Gandhiv which I rely on, I'm master of it. But right now my physical condition, I'm not capable. My body is failing me.\n\nThe Gandhi was slipping from my hand and my skin is burning. I am also unable to stand. Nacha saknami avasthatum I can't even stand. I need to sit down, I need to lie down. Brahmativa Chemamamanah My mind is whirling. So he is giving another mental condition.\n\nI'm having this physical sickness. I am losing strength but I am also having the anxiety attack. So basically he is having the nervous breakdown, the anxiety attack. And what happens when you not control that situation. So the next verse says nimitta ni chapashyami vi paritha ni keshava. I now see clearly one hand.\n\nI can't even think straight, what's going on? I can stand right, but now I can see clearly Nimittami. I can clearly see vi paritha Nikeshava that something bad is going to happen. I see it is delusion. When we start having the superstitions, oh, because I woke up on this side, then this will happen. Things which I know intellectually not possible.\n\nBlack cat crossing my way cannot have any effect on what I'm going to do when I get to my office. But my mind says no, but that is because I'm not listening to my subjective intellect as Swamiji says. But something I heard before and some superstition, I'm believing in it. So now he is basically clearly exhibiting the signs of delusion. Nimittani chapashyami vi parithni keshava nacha sreya anupashyami hatwa swajanam ahaven. I do not see any good coming out of it by killing my own people.\n\nSo he has gone from I can't comprehend this situation which I'm facing, therefore I'm losing the strength. I'm having this physical symptoms of nervous breakdown. I'm having anxiety attack. How I'm going to handle this thing. Now I come to the conclusion that this is probably not the right thing to do. So now I'm creating my own reality and then believing it.\n\nMore I stay in that condition, more I believe in it. Swamiji says the intellect which is normally guiding you is not available to you, but you create an alternate reality. And now I have all the good reason to believe in the realities. So I'm now believing in that alternate universe which I'm living in. And then I have all the justification. So the justification, my mind is creating the justifications, not intellect.\n\nSo intellect has basically resigned from guiding you. Mind takes over and says I have all the answers. Let me tell you what is happening here in that state of that anxiety and delusion. A dream like situation. In dream we create our own reality. That reality at that time is very real to me.\n\nSomebody who's dreaming, you try to convince him you're dreaming. Obviously he will not listen to you as long as he's in dream. Only if he wakes up from that dream, he will listen to you this delusion is something similar to that. That reality is so real for that person that he is not willing to accept the other reality which other people see as the real. Therefore, when you have any kind of a mental disorder, you go to some professional psychiatrist. Because if you talk to your relatives or friends, you will not listen to them say, no, no, I know, but maybe you listen to somebody who you think is third party, who has no X to grind in your life, and you tell him.\n\nThen in the end he says, okay, that's fine, our session is over. The charges are $350 an hour. He said, you suddenly come out of your depression. How many hours can I spend here? But that's obviously because you are someone who is not invested in your situation. And you're seeing from his perspective.\n\nAnd that person tells you Krishna obviously is that person. Krishna is the psychiatrist here. The good news is Arjuna has faith in Krishna. First his argument going forward why he should not be in this situation. Now, how this situation came upon him is obviously up to our imagination, but we have seen the description of what's happening. If this is an effect, that this is what happened to Arjuna, there is a cause for it.\n\nSo the cause can be only one of the two causes. Sanjaya said he was overwhelmed by the pity and compassion that I can be the cause for destruction of all my relatives. So that may be one cause. Maybe he felt that compassion that how can I be the cause for my people and all the people on the other side to be killed? Swamiji says there is another reason this can happen. He realized the task at hand is not as simple as he thought, because he never imagined a situation other than him winning.\n\nAll I have to do is get rid of Duryodhana, win this war and the kingdom will be rightfully mine. He never thought about what support Duryodhana will have. Duryodhana support from Bheeshma, Drona, Kurupacharya, all those great warriors who are as good or better than him.",
      "reflection": "Consider a situation in your own life where you face conflicting duties—where doing right by one person or principle seems to require doing wrong by another. The Gita doesn't offer easy answers to such dilemmas, but it invites us to face them honestly rather than avoiding them.\n\nToday, notice if there's something you're choosing not to see because the truth would be uncomfortable. Dhritarashtra's tragedy wasn't his blindness—it was his refusal of sight when it was offered. What truths are you avoiding? What would happen if you faced them directly?\n\nThe battlefield isn't just Kurukshetra. It's wherever you are right now, facing whatever you're facing. And the question the Gita asks is the same one Dhritarashtra asked: What will you do?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter one, Arjuna Vishada Yoga, Yoga of Arjuna's Grief. So we had been seeing various characters involved in this Mahabharata. It reminds me of something I had read somewhere in our scriptural literature which says Yat Pinde Tat Brahmande. That which is at this microcosm is at the macrocosm. If I find something in me, I'll be able to find in the cosmos. The master plan for the microcosm and macrocosm is just one and the same.\n\nSo if I find something in macrocosm, I should also be able to find in microcosm, at my individual level, the efficient cause and material cause for the universe. The same efficient cause and material cause for me. Therefore, if I can observe something in the universe, I can also apply that to my own life. Something similar is being said for Mahabharata. As we have discussed before, Mahabharata contains all human situations and characters. So if I find a character in Mahabharata, and if I introspect very carefully, I'll find that character in me too, in my own personality.\n\nLet me find Dhritarashtra in me. Blinded by attachment to his children, he cannot see what is right and wrong when it comes to his children. I can also probably find Duryodhana in me. That Duryodhana, he wanted to keep something which came accidentally to him, but he now doesn't want to give it up. Many Internet millionaires in late 90s and early 2000s, what they went through afterwards, actually know one person in particular who made millions in this technology. And once he got out of that, he made all his efforts to retain that and failed miserably.\n\nThat's Duryodhana, Nina. Something came to us accidentally, but I don't want to give it up. We also want Bhishma in US who is very rigidly following the rules but ignoring the principles. When it comes to paying taxes, we are more like Bhishma. If I can find that I meet the IRS criteria in not paying any taxes, even though I am A multi billion dollar corporation, that's perfectly legal. But I completely forget the principle of paying taxes.\n\nIt's for the social welfare. If I don't pay anything, I'm not contributing anything to the social welfare. So I may find Bhishma in me who is rigidly following the rules but forgetting the principles. I may find Arjuna in me who is very keen on overcoming the obstacles which are in his path of his happiness, what we think is rightfully his. He wants to get over those obstacles. In this case, Duryodhana.\n\nDuryodhana is in his path of finding that happiness, of getting that kingdom back. We have all enthusiasm to march forward towards our success. And if there is anything in our way, going to get rid of it. But we hope that we also find Krishna in us who says, well, look at it comprehensively. So Krishna said, look at all these people. All the Kurus are gathered here not only on the other side, but also on your side.\n\nThe Kurus on your side too. Look at them basically reminding, look at the situation, what you're trying to achieve. How many people have to make what kind of sacrifices for you to achieve your own goal? In our enthusiasm to achieve success and move forward in our life, we completely forget how many people are making sacrifices for us on our own side. From our family, from your friends, from your relative. Lots of people have to do a lot of things so that I can move forward in my life.\n\nThat is one point we forget to acknowledge. We never say thank you to people who supported us, who brought me to this level. But we also, I am a self made man. I came here with $8 in my pocket. I'm not sure that the young generation understands. My generation understands.\n\nIndia used to have restriction that only you can take $8 in foreign exchange when you leave India. So people very proudly say, I came with $8 and look at what I accomplished. We forget to acknowledge what my parents did to get to the point where I can take the $8 and come here. So Krishna reminds us that look at on all sides. Make sure that you understand that lots of people have to make lots of sacrifices for you to come to a point where you are capable of overcoming the obstacles which you perceive as the obstacles in the path of happiness. The message we get here is not only that we should introspect negative in us, but also we should introspect and find that Krishna's voice in us.\n\nThen see what is the guidance here. Arjuna now sees the situation in its totality. He looks at how many people are gathered Here and the impact on him is what we are now seeing from Sanjay's description. So Sanjaya says, Krupaya Paraya Vistaha Visidhan Idham Abhravit. Overwhelmed by great compassion or pity, he sorrowfully said this. So Sanjaya says by observing who are gathered on both sides that Arjuna came over with immense pity or compassion.\n\nBut he's sorrowful that I'm not going to achieve the goal I came here to achieve. I came here to eliminate the evil of Duryodhana, then establish the kingdom which is rightfully ours. So he is now conflicted about whether it is good for him to continue or it will be very noble of him to walk away from the situation. We see this situation many times. The student is very bright and he wants to go to Harvard. Then he realizes family has to make the sacrifice the family cannot afford.\n\nCome from a poor family. They say it will be okay, I'll go to community college. Out of the compassion for his family members. So Bhagavan says, well look at is this the situation here? So we hear from Arjuna. I say Dristwa Imam Swajanam K Krishna Yuyutsum Sam Upasthitam by seeing all the dear ones gathered here and eager to fight.\n\nSiddhanti Mama Gatrani My limbs are failing me. I am the mightiest warrior but I don't have any strength. Mukham Chav Parishati My mouth is drying up, my body shivering. I'm having goosebumps. I'm overwhelmed by fear, very fearful. Then I have a goosebump or too excited when I get goosebumps.\n\nSo in this verse he describes his physical condition. And the medical professionals in the room will say, well that's a nervous breakdown situation. So Arjuna basically had the symptoms of nervous brain. The next verse says Gandhivam Sansrate Hasta TV Nacha saknomi avasthatum Brahmati evacham me Manaha that I can even hold my bow Gandhiv which I rely on, I'm master of it.

Nacha saknami avasthatum I can't even stand. I need to sit down, I need to lie down. Brahmativa Chemamamanah My mind is whirling. So he is giving another mental condition.\n\nI'm having this physical sickness. I am losing strength but I am also having the anxiety attack. So basically he is having the nervous breakdown, the anxiety attack. And what happens when you not control that situation. So the next verse says nimitta ni chapashyami vi paritha ni keshava. I now see clearly one hand.\n\nI can't even think straight, what's going on? I can stand right, but now I can see clearly Nimittami. I can clearly see vi paritha Nikeshava that something bad is going to happen. I see it is delusion. When we start having the superstitions, oh, because I woke up on this side, then this will happen.

So now he is basically clearly exhibiting the signs of delusion. Nimittani chapashyami vi parithni keshava nacha sreya anupashyami hatwa swajanam ahaven. I do not see any good coming out of it by killing my own people.\n\nSo he has gone from I can't comprehend this situation which I'm facing, therefore I'm losing the strength. I'm having this physical symptoms of nervous breakdown. I'm having anxiety attack. How I'm going to handle this thing. Now I come to the conclusion that this is probably not the right thing to do.

      ],
      "commentary": "The Dhritarashtra asked the question, what's happening in the Dharmakshetra Kurukshetra and what Main and Pandavad are doing? Duryodhana's perspective he was insecure. Even though he had the largest army, he cannot take the winning for granted. Then we have seen Arjuna's request to Krishna to put chariot in the middle of the army. And then we have seen that once Krishna did that. Krishna just said, look at Bheeshma, Drona, all the Kauravas gathered here, ready to fight.\n\nMost of the time we focus on what we are trying to achieve in life. And then when we achieve that, we take all the credit to ourselves. We tend to forget that there are lots of people have to make lots of sacrifices for us to get to that point. So basically the Krishna's message to Arjuna is look at how many people are here to support your cause. Make sure that you acknowledge that, that it's not you who will be capable of winning this war. Arjuna always thought that he can win this war.\n\nHe has won it before. You know, he went to fight with Drupada for Drona and earned half his kingdom for Drona. He fought with Gandharvas when they captured Duryodhana. And he also fought Kaurava's army when they attacked Virata's kingdom. And he has won all the time. He has not learned yet what failure is in his life.\n\nSo he had his own opinion about what his capabilities are and what he can do. But when he sees both sides, he sees the enormity of the task. That is not as simple as just winning the battle against enemies. Now you are fighting among your own people, in the people who are as capable of himself, Bheeshma and Drona and all other people, Karna and. And he sees that on his side also all his family members are there to help him. That creates confusion in his mind.\n\nSo we have seen last few verses that he first had this nervous breakdown. What am I doing here? Is this the right thing to do? Is it really worth fighting this war. And finally he has the delusion about what the situation is all about. So then he obviously starts describing what he's feeling.\n\nSo first he said, I can't even stand my body shivering. I can't even hold my Gandiva. The Gandiva is slipping away from my hand. All the physical symptoms of person who is having nervous breakdown. But now he's describing what he thinks the reality is a delusion. Person sees reality as if he's seeing in a dream, an alternate reality.\n\nOther people see reality one way but the person is under delusion. He sees reality differently. He starts describing his reality very differently. The first thing he says, Nimitta ni che pasyami vi paritha ni keshava nacha shreyo anupashyami hatva sajanam ahave. Nothing good is going to come out of this war. I now see that something wrong is happening here.\n\nSo we can see now he is having a superstition. My left eye is fluttering. So that's not good, right? I had a surgery on Thursday. We were getting ready and Meena was boiling milk. Now obviously you know what we consider bad omen?\n\nSo Mina was very careful. She was standing right in front of the milk and I didn't even know any of that. But I'm just sitting there. And then for one second she turned around to, to wash a cup or something and the milk spilled and she literally screamed, you know, I don't. I said, what happened? I thought that something really bad had really happened.\n\nSo I got up from the chair and said, what's happened? That's just the milk. I thought, oh, that's okay. I didn't want this to happen. So I realized inside what's bothering her because we were already double minded going for a surgery because my vision was relatively okay. But doctor said your lens has come loose and it can fall anytime.\n\nSo it's good to get it done. I say you can do it whenever you feel like, but it's not going anywhere. But still, like your camera lens is loose. We decided, well, let's get it over with. And I realized what is bothering her, that we are going for surgery and he's a bad omen. So I didn't say a word because I knew what she was bothering her.\n\nBut I didn't discuss that because I knew if I discuss that, it will go even further back if I try to say, don't worry, I don't believe in that. Let's even make it worse. I have not Discussed that with her. But I could see clearly what she was worried about. So whenever mind is not seeing the reality clear, then it's a simple milk boiling over. It works as described in physics books.\n\nBut we don't see it that way. It's not the laws of physics now we are worried about. We're worried about some metaphysical rules of how things work in this world. So Arjuna now is not seeing reality as is. He said, I'm not seeing. I think logically I come to this country simply.\n\nI just see bad omens. So that's the sign of a delusion. And then he says, Nakank se Vijayam Krishna Nacharajyam Sukha nicha kim no Rajya na Govinda kim bhogi jeevte Nava. I desire no victory, O Krishna. I don't own the kingdom Na Sukhani. I don't any comforts.\n\nWhat is the purpose of having all this domain to us? Govinda Isham arthe kanksitam nah Rajyam Bhogaha Sukha nicha ta IME Avasthita Yudhte pranam tyaktva Dhananicha. For whom we desire this kingdom and comforts for our own people. Every parent says that we have done this for our children. Nobody said I did it for myself. This is for whom we desire this kingdom and this comfort and all the prosperity.\n\nThey are standing here to fight this war. Acharyaha, Pitaraha, Putraha, Tatha, Ivach, Pita Mah. My teachers, my fatherly relatives. Matulaha, Swasuraha, Pautraha, Shyalaha, Samandinisthada. My sons, grandfathers, maternal relatives, Swasuraha in laws, Potraha. My grandchildren, Sialaha in laws again, Sabandin and all other relatives.\n\nEtan ichami Gnatoapi Madhusudana. I do not desire to kill them. Even if I get killed, Even if I get the domain over all three worlds. Some of Puranas describe three worlds. Swargalok, Mrityulok and Patal Lok Mrityulog. Because we are all mortals, things are impermanent.\n\nIn Mrityulog, Swargalok, everything is always pristine and serene. Patalok is beyond our world. More like past, present and future. So even if I have the domain of all three worlds, it's not worth it to kill my own people. Then what is the point in fighting for a little piece of Land, this little kingdom on this earth, in this mortal world. So he made his statement very clear.\n\nNow, if these words were his own, after reflection on the situation over a period of time and very intense contemplation, whether this is right or that's right, then he comes to this conclusion. These are very noble words for whom we are desiring all this. If these people are not going to benefit, or these people have to make sacrifice, it's not worth it. But we know that he did not do that before, because just before Bheeshma Parva, there's Udayoga Parva. Bheesma Parva starts when the war starts. The efforts both sides made to avoid this war.\n\nDrupada sends his Brahmin diplomat to go and negotiate it out. Look, this war is not worth. So Drupada's emissary goes to Dhritarashtra's court and makes the argument why it is best for everybody to divide this kingdom into half as it was before, give Pandavas theirs. This enough for both of you to enjoy these kingdoms. Dhritarashtra was pretty much convinced that that's the right thing to do. Bhishma had given his advice that to avoid this war, this is the only way.\n\nKarna interrupted Bhma and said no. Yudhishthira lost his kingdom in this game of dice. Now if he wants this kingdom back, he has to beg. There is no settlement. And Visma actually told Karna that if you don't listen to what the guy just say and don't agree to it, you'll end up in a war. And that's not going to be any good for anybody.\n\nSo there are two characters here who are against settlement, Duryodhana and Karna. Karna had his own agenda. He had no interest in who wins this war. You know, his agenda was he wanted to prove he's better than Arjuna. If this war does not occur, Karna had no chance to prove that he is better than Arjuna. So he has his own agenda.\n\nSo then I can prove myself that Arjuna is not the best archer in the world. I am the best archer in the world. Then Dhritarashtra sends Sanjaya to Yudhishthira to have his side of proposal for settlement. And that proposal was very simple. War is not good for anybody. Exactly the words which you are hearing from Arjuna.\n\nSo Sanjaya made his case. I'm here on behalf of King Dhritarashtra. King is reminding you that my children are spoiled. They are not listening to me. What they are doing is not right. However, you people are good people.\n\nYou should know what is right and wrong. It's like two children fighting in a family. You also don't understand being an older one. Exact same message to the Yudhishthira that you are. Dharmaraj, how can you engage in this Adharma of fighting a war against your own cousins? Arjun at the time said give Duryodhan a message that Keshav and I will kill you, the evil Dury and all evil cousins.\n\nEven Indra's army cannot defeat when Krishna and I are together. And he said my Gandiva is twitching, arrows are peeping out of cleaver. So he basically said I'm so anxious. But Dhritarashtra plants the seeds that the war is never good. The result of any war is nothing but hell whether you win the war or lose the war. So the ideas presented were logical.\n\nWhen you look at it from a very narrow perspective. So here the words which are hearing from Arjuna are literally borrowed from Sanjaya's message, then there is no good coming out of it. Swamiji points out here that this is a case of a rift between your Buddhi and your mind. Buddhi is your subjective mind. This buddhi is available when I'm thinking very rationally and seeking Buddhist guidance. He's already demonstrated that he lost all control over his mind.\n\nSo this subjective mind, which is buddhi, an objective mind, objective mind is simply receiving information from outside and trying to interpret. But it does not have much experience. So it has to rely on a Buddha to decide whether this situation is what it is all about and how to react to the situation. So here Arjuna is now one side. He is torn between his desire to win over Duryodhana, set the record straight and get what is rightful his because he's capable of doing so. The other side, he now remembers that everything Sanjaya said is true.\n\nThey're all standing right in front of me and I have to fight them and I have to kill them. They may get killed, my people may get killed. But in the end the winning or losing may not mean anything because we have lost our own people. So right now what we are seeing is confusion created by Dhritarashtra. Like the argument we hear recently in our impeachment. Some Republican senators or congressmen said whatever Trump did is not right, but it is not worth impeaching.\n\nWe should be sorting this out internally. Dhritarasa sent the same message through Sanjaya. Whatever Duryodhana is doing is not right. But if you people are wise enough.",
      "reflection": "Consider a situation in your own life where you face conflicting duties—where doing right by one person or principle seems to require doing wrong by another. The Gita doesn't offer easy answers to such dilemmas, but it invites us to face them honestly rather than avoiding them.\n\nToday, notice if there's something you're choosing not to see because the truth would be uncomfortable. Dhritarashtra's tragedy wasn't his blindness—it was his refusal of sight when it was offered. What truths are you avoiding? What would happen if you faced them directly?\n\nThe battlefield isn't just Kurukshetra. It's wherever you are right now, facing whatever you're facing. And the question the Gita asks is the same one Dhritarashtra asked: What will you do?"

      ],
      "commentary": "These three verses capture one of the most psychologically acute moments in the entire Gita. Arjuna has moved from describing the horror of what he's about to do to making what seems like a perfectly reasonable moral argument. And this is where things get interesting.\n\nLook at the progression of his thinking: In verse 37, he appeals to Krishna as \"Madhava\"—a name that emphasizes Krishna's divine nature. He's essentially saying, \"You're the Supreme Lord. Surely you understand that killing one's own people cannot lead to happiness.\" It's a clever move. He's not just expressing despair anymore; he's constructing an argument.\n\nAnd then comes verse 38, where Arjuna reveals something fascinating about how he sees his opponents. He says that *they*—Duryodhana and his party—are blinded by greed. Their minds are clouded. They cannot see the sin they're committing by destroying families and betraying friends. In other words, they have an excuse: ignorance.\n\nBut verse 39 delivers the real punch. Arjuna says: We can see clearly. We understand exactly what's wrong with this situation. And precisely because we see clearly, we have a greater responsibility to turn away from this sin.\n\nThis is where Arjuna's argument becomes both compelling and problematic.\n\nOn the surface, it makes perfect sense. If I know something is wrong and do it anyway, am I not more culpable than someone who acts from ignorance? Isn't knowledge supposed to guide action? Isn't the wise person supposed to refrain from harmful acts?\n\nYes—and yet.\n\nSwami Chinmayananda would often point out that Arjuna is using valid spiritual principles to arrive at an invalid conclusion. This is one of the mind's most sophisticated tricks: using dharma to justify adharma, using wisdom to rationalize avoidance, using compassion as a mask for fear.\n\nThe key word in verse 38 is *lobha*—greed. Arjuna accuses his enemies of being driven by greed. But wait. What is driving Arjuna right now? Is it pure moral clarity? Or is it something else wearing the clothes of moral clarity?\n\nConsider: Arjuna doesn't want to lose his loved ones. He doesn't want to bear the psychological burden of having killed his grandfather, his teacher, his cousins. He doesn't want to live with that memory. These are understandable human desires. But they are, in their own way, also forms of attachment—of wanting things to be a certain way, of grasping at a particular outcome.\n\nThe Gita will spend the next seventeen chapters addressing exactly this confusion. For now, we simply need to notice it.\n\nThere's another layer to explore here. Arjuna says he can \"clearly see\" the evil of destroying families. But seeing clearly is precisely what he's not doing.\n\nHere's what Arjuna is not seeing: He's not seeing that this war has been coming for decades. He's not seeing that every peaceful option was exhausted. He's not seeing that Duryodhana rejected every compromise, every appeal to justice, every opportunity for reconciliation. He's not seeing that sometimes standing up to adharma requires actions that are painful.\n\nMost importantly, he's not seeing himself clearly. He thinks he's being noble. He thinks refusing to fight is the ethical choice. But mixed into his reasoning are threads of fear, attachment, and confusion that he can't distinguish from his genuine moral concerns.\n\nThis is the human condition. We rarely have pure motives. Our noblest intentions are intertwined with our fears and desires. The person who refuses to have a difficult conversation \"to keep the peace\" may genuinely care about peace—and may also be afraid of conflict. The person who \"doesn't want to hurt anyone\" may be compassionate—and may also be avoiding the discomfort of standing firm.\n\nArjuna is not a villain. He's not being dishonest. He is genuinely confused. And that's the point. The Gita takes seriously the fact that confusion can feel like clarity, that attachment can dress itself up as wisdom.\n\nThere's a beautiful irony in verse 39 that often goes unnoticed. Arjuna asks: \"Why should we not learn to turn away from this sin?\"\n\nLearn. He uses the word *jñeya*—that which should be known, that which should be learned.\n\nBut learning is exactly what's about to happen. Krishna is going to teach him. The next seventeen chapters are Arjuna's education. And what will he learn? Not that killing is good. Not that compassion doesn't matter. But that his understanding of the situation is incomplete, that his identification of what constitutes sin and virtue is confused, that his notion of who he is and what he's doing needs to be fundamentally revised.\n\nThe great teaching is coming. But it can only come because Arjuna asked for it—even though he didn't know he was asking. His anguish, his paralysis, his philosophical objections—all of these created the opening through which wisdom could enter.\n\nIn verse 7 of Chapter 2, Arjuna will formally ask Krishna to teach him. But in a sense, the request is already implicit here. A mind that is questioning, struggling, refusing to act from blind obedience—this is a mind that is ready to learn.\n\nLet's also notice how Arjuna addresses Krishna in these verses. In verse 37, he says \"Madhava\"—emphasizing Krishna's divine descent through the Madhu lineage. In verse 39, he says \"Janardana\"—a name meaning \"one who causes people to tremble\" or more positively \"one who answers the prayers of people.\"\n\nThese names reveal something about Arjuna's state. He's appealing to Krishna's divinity, his power, his role as the one who responds to devotees' prayers. On some level, Arjuna knows that what he needs right now is not just practical advice but divine guidance. He may think he wants Krishna to validate his choice not to fight. But deeper down, he's calling out to the divine for rescue from his own confusion.\n\nEvery sincere prayer is like this. We think we know what we want. We think we're asking for something specific. But underneath the specific request is a more fundamental cry: Help me. Show me. I am lost.\n\nThese verses also touch on one of life's most difficult truths: the fact that others' wrongdoing does not excuse us from our own responsibilities.\n\nArjuna says, in effect: \"They are blinded by greed. They don't see clearly. Therefore they can be excused for their actions. But we see clearly—so we should act accordingly.\"\n\nThe logic seems impeccable. But here's the problem: In a world where everyone excused themselves from difficult action by pointing to others' moral failures, nothing would ever get done. Evil would flourish unchecked, protected by the scruples of good people who didn't want to dirty their hands.\n\nThis is one of the oldest moral debates in human history. How do we respond to wrongdoing? Is it better to remain pure and let evil triumph? Or to engage with the messy, morally ambiguous work of opposing it?\n\nThe Gita's answer will be nuanced. It won't simply say \"fight\" or \"don't fight.\" It will reframe the entire question by introducing the concept of *nishkama karma*—action without attachment to results. It will distinguish between the action itself and the ego that claims ownership of the action. It will show that the real sin is not in acting but in acting from a place of ego, attachment, and delusion.\n\nBut we're not there yet. Right now, we're sitting with Arjuna in his confusion. And perhaps that's where we need to start—acknowledging our own confusion, our own mixed motives, our own sophisticated rationalizations. Before we can receive the teaching, we have to feel the weight of not knowing.\n\nThere's something else worth exploring in these verses—the concept of *sukha*, happiness. In verse 37, Arjuna asks: \"How can we be happy by killing our own people?\"\n\nIt's a reasonable question. And it points to something fundamental about how most of us think about ethics and action. We tend to evaluate our choices based on whether they will make us happy or unhappy. Will this bring me peace? Will I be able to live with myself?\n\nBut the Gita is going to challenge this entire framework. Krishna will eventually teach that true happiness—*ananda*—doesn't depend on external circumstances at all. It doesn't come from the results of our actions, whether pleasant or painful. It comes from something deeper, something that remains constant regardless of what happens in the world.\n\nArjuna is worried about his future mental state. He's trying to protect his peace of mind. And from one perspective, this seems wise. But from another perspective, it reveals the problem: he's making his decision based on attachment to a particular inner state rather than based on what the situation actually requires.\n\nThis is subtle, and it's worth sitting with. We often pride ourselves on being conscientious people who care about the consequences of our actions. But sometimes that very conscientiousness becomes another form of self-centeredness—we're so focused on how we'll feel afterward that we can't see clearly what needs to be done now.\n\nThe word *kula* appears repeatedly in these verses—it means family, lineage, or clan. Arjuna speaks of *kulakshaya*, the destruction of families. This was a profound concern in the ancient world, where family lineage carried tremendous weight, where ancestral traditions were passed down through generations, where the continuity of the clan was seen as sacred.\n\nBut here's the thing: the Kauravas had already destroyed the family. Duryodhana's greed, his jealousy, his repeated attempts to murder his cousins, his public humiliation of Draupadi—all of this had already torn the fabric of the family apart. The war wasn't destroying something intact; it was the final consequence of decades of destruction that had already occurred.\n\nArjuna speaks as if he has a choice between preserving the family and destroying it. But that choice was made long ago, by others. What Arjuna actually faces is a different choice: whether to stand up for dharma in the aftermath of destruction, or to let adharma triumph unchallenged.\n\nThis distinction matters in our own lives too. We sometimes imagine that by withdrawing from conflict, we're preserving peace. But often, by the time we face a difficult choice, the damage has already been done by others. Our choice isn't between peace and conflict; it's between facing reality and pretending it doesn't exist.\n\nOne final observation about these verses. Notice that Arjuna is still talking. He's been making arguments for verses now—philosophical, emotional, moral arguments. He's been eloquent. He's been passionate. He's made some excellent points.\n\nBut he hasn't asked Krishna for guidance yet. Not really. He's presenting his case, building his argument, trying to convince Krishna that he's right. He's still operating from the assumption that he understands the situation and just needs validation.\n\nThe real breakthrough will come in Chapter 2, when Arjuna finally admits: \"I don't know what's right. I'm confused. Please teach me.\" Until he reaches that point of genuine not-knowing, no teaching can enter.\n\nThis is true for all of us. As long as we're sure we're right, as long as we're building our case and making our arguments, we're not actually open to learning anything new. Wisdom requires a particular kind of humility—the willingness to admit that our current understanding might be incomplete or mistaken.\n\nArjuna isn't there yet. But he's getting closer. Each verse brings him nearer to the point of surrender. And that's the arc of Chapter 1: the gradual dissolution of certainty, the slow crumbling of confidence, until finally there's enough openness for something new to emerge.",
      "reflection": "Consider a situation in your life where moral clarity seems to lead toward inaction. Where doing nothing feels like the ethical choice. Where engaging with difficulty feels like it would compromise your principles.\n\nNow ask yourself: Is this really clarity, or might it be attachment wearing the mask of wisdom? Is there something I don't want to lose? Something I don't want to face? Something I'm afraid of?\n\nThis isn't to say that every instance of stepping back is wrong. Sometimes restraint is exactly what's called for. But the Gita invites us to examine our motives with rigorous honesty. To notice when our \"principles\" conveniently align with our fears. To question whether our \"seeing clearly\" might itself be a kind of not-seeing.\n\nThe next time you find yourself saying \"I can't do that—it wouldn't be right,\" pause. Ask yourself: What is the \"I\" that can't do this? What would it cost me? What am I really protecting?\n\nThese are uncomfortable questions. But they're the questions that crack open the door to genuine wisdom. Arjuna's confusion was the beginning of his education. Yours might be too."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter one, Arjuna, Vishada Yoga, Yoga of Arjuna's Grief. So far in chapter one we have seen that Arjuna was very confident before declaration of the war and he was anxious to get started. But then when he decided to look at the situation in its entirety, we have seen that he started melting down. So we have seen the Arjuna's meltdown. In this chapter, by the sheer enormity of the task and the consequences of the task, we work all of our life to achieve something. Then comes a defining moment in our life.\n\nThat defining moment, how we behave will determine the outcome of what we achieve in life. Gujarat is saying that Gora Dasarana Divasejnadoda, that horse who has been preparing all year for the race which is supposed to be on Dasira day. I think in olden times he was doing very well in practice, but he doesn't run on that race day. So it's a defining moment for Arjuna. They suffered through all the cruelties and injustices and now came the time for him to fight against that. But just looking at the enormity of the task, he realized that he's not prepared for it.\n\nSo the first few scene that he breaks down in his mental attitude and then he starts justifying why this task is not for him. So the first his argument was by killing our relatives, we are going to incursion. There is no really good going to come out of this war because we are fighting against our own people. We will be fighting against our own uncles and our own teachers, our own grandparents and our in laws. So what is the point in it for whom we desire this kingdom? We work hard in our life for the people in our family.\n\nBut if those people in our family are standing against each other and they are ready to destroy each other, what is the point in gaining anything? So there was the first argument. What is the point of fighting this war to get this kingdom? Because for those for whom we are fighting this are ready here to sacrifice their own lives and everything they have on both Sides so he doesn't see really a good outcome. I see bad omen that nothing good is going to come out of it. And then he said, not only that nothing good is going to come out, but killing your own people is a sin.\n\nEven though they are felons, even though they are criminals. So till the time he was seeing the world black and white, there was not much issue. He saw Kauravas as real people and on his side good people, there was not really much problem. He wanted to go eliminate all the evil in this world. But when he saw that evil is not pure evil and good is not pure good, this is what we face in life. Situations we encounter are not black and white.\n\nThey are not cleanly divided between good and bad. Everything in life comes with its own side effects. So any medicine you take is not purely killing the disease, but it will also kill something good in you. So the decision to take is whether the side effects are more important or curing the disease is more important. You take chemotherapy. Obviously there are side effects, but you have to to persevere the side effects to kill the disease.\n\nSo Arjuna is missing that point here. So he's trying to make his argument why this war should not be fought and let those criminals continue doing their criminal acts because they are our relatives. That was his first false argument. If there are other people not my relatives, I will have no problem getting rid of them. But because they are my relatives, I think it's a sin. Even that argument did not make much impression on Krishna.\n\nBecause he was looking for Krishna's validation that his argument is correct. We shouldn't be fighting this war. But he comes to the point that he had already made up his mind. So in verse 37 we have seen that he said tasmat, therefore we shall not fight this war. He's already made up his mind. Previously he made an argument saying I can't stand, I think I'm seeing bad omens.\n\nBut now he said, I have made up my mind, I do not want to fight this war and we should not fight. Not only I should not fight, we should not fight this war because there is nothing good is going to come out of it. Killing our people is sin. That argument did not make any impression on Krishna. So he continued in his argument saying kulakshaye pranashyanti, kuladharmaha sanatanaha. By killing these people we will be killing the family units.\n\nBy fighting this war we'll be killing the head of the family and each family. And once that head of the family is destroyed. The family will be destroyed. These people on the other side, they're not realizing this, that this is the greatest sin to destroy families. But at least we are wise enough to realize the value of family unit, and therefore we should not be committing this sin. So what we are seeing here is the social structure at the time.\n\nThe family was the unit of the society at the time. And the family was not, as we see family now, always a joint family coming from generation to generation, living together and passing on their values from one generation to another. There's always an older generation available to give guidance to the next generation and to enforce the values and the discipline on the second generation. So he said, with that lineage will be broken. Swamiji then points out here that the family unit changed it from a joint family to a couple, husband and wife. So this was Phyllis, Swamiji wrote in 50s and 60s.\n\nIn our time now, that's not a family anymore, or that's not the unit of the society anymore. The unit of the society now is an individual, therefore individual rights. What we are more concerned about in our modern time, previously we have seen a couple's rights were more important. And even today we are fighting about who is considered a couple and who gets the inheritance. But in those days, in Arjuna's time, the family unit was most important, where not one generation, but generations have lived together with each other and passed on their values. You see, when you destroy that lineage of people living together in a family, there will be disaster in the society because you're destroying the unit of the society.\n\nAnd whoever is the cause for the destruction will be the greatest sinner. We know the other people are doing that, but they are ignorant people. We are not ignorant people. Therefore, we shall not engage in the same sinful act. Kulakshaye, Pranashanti, Kula, Dharma, Sanatanah. This eternal Dharma of a family, eternal means because it came from generations, from generations.\n\nMy parents did what they were taught from their parents. Their parents did what they were taught from their parents. That lineage is continuing, and I have a responsibility to pass it on to my next generation. That's called Eternal Kuladharma, that in our family we only do things this way. Dharme, Naste, Kulam, Krishnam, Dharmo, abhi, Bhavyatut. And if Dharma is destroyed, then the entire order in the society will be there, Krishnam.\n\nEntire the whole society. The Dharma of the whole society will be destroyed. As we have seen in our culture, there is Dharma for everything. That which makes you what you are is your Dharma. So I as an individual has a Dharma. I as a member of my family has my own Dharma that I can only act this way.\n\nI as a part of the society has Dharma as a part of the civilized society. How I act and behave, the society has its own Dharma. So all these Dharmas which are dependent on an individual and in this case individual family, Arjuna says they will be all destroyed. The whole society will be in disarray because there is no order. There is no order in the family. Therefore there will not be order in the community.\n\nAnd there is no order in the community. There is no order in the society. And we will be the guilty parties that we started this war. And all this happened. So Adharma bhi bhavat Krishna Pradishyanti Kulastriyaha. And he's trying to demonstrate how this Dharma will now be destroyed.\n\nWhy war will destroy Dharma in the society. Now none of these arguments is invalid. The argument he is making are all valid argument. Because we have seen after wars this does happen. And they may have seen that too. However, at that time, the only remedy was the war.\n\nSometimes the disease is so acute you have to take the side effects with it. But it is more important to kill the disease. Because by fear of the side effects, you don't take the medication, then the disease will kill you. So here it was very important to cure the disease. But Arjuna is now more focused on the side effects. So he's now explaining to Krishna, saying aaa Dharma bhi bhavat Krishna pradishyanti kulastriya ha.\n\nBecause now the society has no order. It will corrupt the women in this society. Now obviously we all get very upset when it comes to this type of statement in our scriptures. But remember one thing. The context of this statement is society at that time, not the society today. Society today has given enough opportunities for women to be independent.\n\nThey can function independently. You don't really need a man to support you. Just two generations ago, that was not really possible. You remember at least? I remember because I'm old enough to remember my older generation, which was relatively living a similar life. So when a daughter is given away, they used to give us three dhan eventually became a dowry.\n\nWas not really a dowry in the olden society. It was given as a security wealth to the woman. If something happens to her husband, she will be protected. She will have means to support herself. There was called Tridhan in the marriage. The parents of the bride will give it to the bride as a gift.\n\nAnd that is Supposed to be very sacred, that you will not touch, that you will not waste, that Sridhan, the husband will have no right to use this Sridhar. There was a security for that woman because there was no other means for her to support herself. Now you can regress it back to 3,500 years ago, when society was completely different, where the division of labor was clearly defined between men and women. Our society had evolved from hunter gatherer society. The hunter gatherer society, there was very clear division of labor. Men will go out and hunt and bring food, women will stay in the caves and take care of children.\n\nObviously you couldn't reverse that in that society. And that was basically a model continued in our society where men went out and worked in the world outside to generate wealth and women took care of the family. Now, if the man is out, the one part of that unit which was responsible to support the family is gone. And if the woman does not have any means to do that, then obviously there will be corruption. Arjuna is making his argument here, that why it is so important to keep the family unit intact. So in that time society, maybe one person dies in a family, but there was other male in the.\n\nIn the family who will be there to take care of the widow and her children.",
      "reflection": "Consider a situation in your own life where you face conflicting duties—where doing right by one person or principle seems to require doing wrong by another. The Gita doesn't offer easy answers to such dilemmas, but it invites us to face them honestly rather than avoiding them.\n\nToday, notice if there's something you're choosing not to see because the truth would be uncomfortable. Dhritarashtra's tragedy wasn't his blindness—it was his refusal of sight when it was offered. What truths are you avoiding? What would happen if you faced them directly?\n\nThe battlefield isn't just Kurukshetra. It's wherever you are right now, facing whatever you're facing. And the question the Gita asks is the same one Dhritarashtra asked: What will you do?"

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter one, Arjuna Vishada, Yoga, Yoga of Arjuna's Grave. We have come to the final concluding _Verses_ of chapter one. So the chapter one paints a scenario where if not millions, thousands of people gathered in Kurukshetra to do whatever they do best. So they basically to fight the war. So Kurukshetra is also called dharmakshetra by Dhritarashtra in the first words. The first was Dhritarashtra says, I want to know what's happening in the Kurukshetra, which is a dharmakshetra.\n\nSo Kurukshetra is analogous to Karmakshetra, field of action. Also it's called dharmakshetra, which is analogous to a field of actions where I can practice my dharma, Dharma that which I'm prepared for. So for an architect like me, Dharma Kshetra is my office and practice art of architecture. Well, that's my dharmakshetra. My dharma as an architect is to design buildings. The field of action which gives me an opportunity to practice that art is my dharmakshetra.\n\nSo this scenario which is painted is analogous to the situations which we find ourselves in our lives. So every year the universities have graduation ceremonies where we see the sea of students who are graduating, ready to enter into the workforce. And obviously the question in the parent's mind is whether my son will be successful in wherever he practices his whatever the education and the profession which he has prepared himself for. And obviously the thought comes to our mind is that maybe the one who has the most resources will be successful in his life, person who comes from a good family, who has a family background, has a family business. Well, maybe that person will be successful in his life. Or the other thought is maybe the one who is well equipped, who is a good student, has the highest grade, who is always ahead in this class, that he will be the most successful in his life.\n\nBut I guess the experience in life, we have seen that both formulas do not work all the time. It may work sometime or not all the time. But what works all the time is the one with the character and integrity that person will be, certainly will be successful in life. So it is the character building which is the goal of any scripture or any study of scripture like Bhagavad Gita. So therefore, Swamiji actually calls the study of Bhagavad Gita Art of Man Making. There are two books on art of man making by Swami Chinmayananda.\n\nThey were actually radio lectures by Swami GM Bhagavad Gita, and he called them Art of Man Making. So chapter one has prepared us to introspect and be aware of our own situations. So up till now, before we decided to learn Bhagavad Gita, we were facing the situation, but not very aware of what to look for, how to prepare ourselves for it. So therefore, this chapter is called Arjuna Vishadhi Yoga. And there's always the question why this is the Yoga. Other chapters can be Yoga, but why this chapter is also called Yoga.\n\nThis chapter actually united us with our own situations which we were oblivious about. We did not know why I am doing what and why I am successful or I am failing. We are experiencing all these things, but we did not have a system to analyze and see what makes an activity successful or what makes my actions productive. So the study of Bhagavad Gita will now teach us, will prepare us to see situation comprehensively, and then we can decide how to act in this life. And therefore it's called Arjuna Vishadaya. It connected him to his own situation.\n\nSo so far we have seen in this chapter that Arjun was very anxious while they were preparing for the war. He considered himself to be something similar to a guy who has graduated at the top of his class and now he's entering workforce. He was always the best, and now he has this field of action where he can basically shine out. So typically we would have anticipated that he would be the last person to have any doubt about fighting this war. They already debated whether this war is righteous or not. So before they gathered in the field of Kurukshetra, there were several incidents we see where Arjuna came out very confident.\n\nHe told Sanjay, go tell Duryodhana that when Krishna and I are together, even Indra's army cannot defeat us. Swamiji also points out here that in the beginning of this Bisma Parva there are few _Verses_ where Judhisthe had doubt whether this war is right or not. And Arjuna was the one who gave him the right perspective and he gave him advice that there will be time where fighting war is the only right thing to do for the righteous cause. He said, as long as our cause, they are righteous, we will be the winners. So he's pretty confident. He was in control of his own situation.\n\nAnd then suddenly when he saw all the relatives on both sides, he somehow had nervous breakdown. He had a completely different perception of what's happening. All he's confident about fighting this war not because we want this kingdom, but it's the right thing to do. The cause is right, therefore we have to fight this war. The only thing he saw at that point, I have to kill my own cousins and my own teacher and my own grandfather. So he was more overruled by the attachment than the principal.\n\nSo then we have seen that he had a nervous breakdown, his anxiety, and then he basically has delusion. When he had delusion, he started seeing reality completely differently. Therefore he started making argument about why he does not want to fight this war. So his first argument was, well, they are not smart enough to figure out that this is not a right thing to do, but we are better than them. He put himself on a pedestal saying, I am better than them. They don't know what they are doing, but we know, and therefore we shouldn't be fighting this war.\n\nWhen that argument did not work with Krishna, because he was obviously looking for validation from Krishna that yes, he's on the right path, well, we always try to avoid this war. Arjuna, I'm glad that you realize at the end it's not too late. Let's pack our bags and go home. In verse 37 he has already declared that he said, therefore, let's not participate in this war. We have not heard from Krishna yet. So now he makes a greater moral argument why the war itself is sinful.\n\nWar in any shape and form is sinful. Swamiji says he is the first conscientious objector in the history promoting the pacifist argument about why war should not be fought. Buddha was pacifist, obviously. He promoted that war should not be fought. That was a very different outlook all his life. Right from the beginning.\n\nBuddha saw the thing very differently. Chinmayananda did not see it that way. Suddenly he became pacifist when people were relying on him to fight this battle. So now he makes a moral argument saying that war is sinful because it destroys the family unit. Family unit, which is the basic unit for the society, as we discussed last time, that at that time and even till today, family is the unit which makes any society the families are educated, the society will be educated. So whatever is happening at the microcosm in a family will be happening in the macrocosm in the society.\n\nSo therefore, protecting families is very important, very valid argument he makes then. We have seen that as we progressed in the modern time, the family unit became a couple and the couple became an individual. So now we have individual right is what we are trying to protect. So he makes argument to Krishna that by fighting this war, we'll be destroying families, and therefore we will be the sinners. Because we will be the cause for destroying this family unit, which will ultimately will destroy the entire culture in the society. In a family, the man has the duty to protect and provide for the family.\n\nSo there's a division of labor. Man is providing and protecting the family, woman is nurturing the family. And in that situation, if you take the protector and provider away, the nurturer has no resources to nurture the family. And therefore the nurturer will become corrupt, corruption. She has to do something which is not appropriate for her to get out of her role of nurturer into a provider. And that will eventually make the nurturing part of the family suffer.\n\nIf family is not nurtured, the next generation, the society will suffer. We hear in our society that the children who grow up without any family, they obviously will not have the right values. They do not know what is the right of their life. We have Hindi movies where this hero becomes a gangster because he grew up on the streets and he did not have any support, any guidance from the family. So it's a valid argument he makes that we cannot disrupt this family unit. And therefore he said that we will be the sinner and the one who destroys the family unit.\n\nThat person will go to hell forever. In other words, we will be the cause for creating hell in this society. So it continues argument and says. He makes a moral argument about our responsibility to preserve our culture and social structure. Once we destroy the family, we have destroyed that order. And therefore those men who participate in that, they will go to hell forever.\n\nUtsun kuladharmana Manushyana Janardhana Narake Niyatam Vasaha Bhavati anushushrama. Those men, as you say, will go to hell forever. Traditionally, if you just believe in that, after your death you will be either go to swarga or Narak. Then see in this case, because you definitely going to hell. But Swamiji points out that the broader view of that is that the society will live in hell and you will be part of it. You will be living in hell.\n\nIf the law and order in this society is destroyed by whatever is happening because the corruption people start behaving as if they have all the rights then the overall atmosphere in the society will become not livable every more hellish living. Ahobat Mahatpapam kartum Vyavasita Vayam. You know, basically has concluded his argument and said Ahubat alas Mahat papam kartam Vavasitavayam. He actually tells conclusively to Krishna we engage in this great sin by fighting this war, destroying this family and culture and society. We are sending everyone to hell. Hellish living for everyone.\n\nAnd that is only for Yad Rajya Sukh Lovina. We are only doing it because we want this kingdom. Our greed to have this kingdom is motivating us to engage in this act which is sinful. Yadi Maam pratikaram Asastram Sastra Panayah Dartarashtra Rane Hanyuhu Tanme Shemataram Bhaved. Therefore he is my final decision that even the Dhritarashtra's sons kill me with their weapons and me having no weapons in my hand that will be better for me than killing my own kids and kids. You know, he came to the conclusion that in this life if I can think of what will give me the liberation from my situation that is a better liberation than me fighting the war and winning what is rightfully mine.\n\nHe makes a much greater argument to preserve rightfully theirs with the Kshema. Yoga is something we are trying to achieve which we don't have. Shema is something we have and we are trying to protect it like Shema. So you see, the first argument for fighting this war is for the Shema.",
      "reflection": "Consider a situation in your own life where you face conflicting duties—where doing right by one person or principle seems to require doing wrong by another. The Gita doesn't offer easy answers to such dilemmas, but it invites us to face them honestly rather than avoiding them.\n\nToday, notice if there's something you're choosing not to see because the truth would be uncomfortable. Dhritarashtra's tragedy wasn't his blindness—it was his refusal of sight when it was offered. What truths are you avoiding? What would happen if you faced them directly?\n\nThe battlefield isn't just Kurukshetra. It's wherever you are right now, facing whatever you're facing. And the question the Gita asks is the same one Dhritarashtra asked: What will you do?"

      ],
      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter one, Arjuna Vishada, Yoga, Yoga of Arjuna's Grave. We have come to the final concluding _Verses_ of chapter one. So the chapter one paints a scenario where if not millions, thousands of people gathered in Kurukshetra to do whatever they do best. So they basically to fight the war. So Kurukshetra is also called dharmakshetra by Dhritarashtra in the first words. The first was Dhritarashtra says, I want to know what's happening in the Kurukshetra, which is a dharmakshetra.\n\nSo Kurukshetra is analogous to Karmakshetra, field of action. Also it's called dharmakshetra, which is analogous to a field of actions where I can practice my dharma, Dharma that which I'm prepared for. So for an architect like me, Dharma Kshetra is my office and practice art of architecture. Well, that's my dharmakshetra. My dharma as an architect is to design buildings. The field of action which gives me an opportunity to practice that art is my dharmakshetra.\n\nSo this scenario which is painted is analogous to the situations which we find ourselves in our lives. So every year the universities have graduation ceremonies where we see the sea of students who are graduating, ready to enter into the workforce. And obviously the question in the parent's mind is whether my son will be successful in wherever he practices his whatever the education and the profession which he has prepared himself for. And obviously the thought comes to our mind is that maybe the one who has the most resources will be successful in his life, person who comes from a good family, who has a family background, has a family business. Well, maybe that person will be successful in his life. Or the other thought is maybe the one who is well equipped, who is a good student, has the highest grade, who is always ahead in this class, that he will be the most successful in his life.\n\nBut I guess the experience in life, we have seen that both formulas do not work all the time. It may work sometime or not all the time. But what works all the time is the one with the character and integrity that person will be, certainly will be successful in life. So it is the character building which is the goal of any scripture or any study of scripture like Bhagavad Gita. So therefore, Swamiji actually calls the study of Bhagavad Gita Art of Man Making. There are two books on art of man making by Swami Chinmayananda.\n\nThey were actually radio lectures by Swami GM Bhagavad Gita, and he called them Art of Man Making. So chapter one has prepared us to introspect and be aware of our own situations. So up till now, before we decided to learn Bhagavad Gita, we were facing the situation, but not very aware of what to look for, how to prepare ourselves for it. So therefore, this chapter is called Arjuna Vishadhi Yoga. And there's always the question why this is the Yoga. Other chapters can be Yoga, but why this chapter is also called Yoga.\n\nThis chapter actually united us with our own situations which we were oblivious about. We did not know why I am doing what and why I am successful or I am failing. We are experiencing all these things, but we did not have a system to analyze and see what makes an activity successful or what makes my actions productive. So the study of Bhagavad Gita will now teach us, will prepare us to see situation comprehensively, and then we can decide how to act in this life. And therefore it's called Arjuna Vishadaya.

So he was more overruled by the attachment than the principal.\n\nSo then we have seen that he had a nervous breakdown, his anxiety, and then he basically has delusion. When he had delusion, he started seeing reality completely differently. Therefore he started making argument about why he does not want to fight this war. So his first argument was, well, they are not smart enough to figure out that this is not a right thing to do, but we are better than them. He put himself on a pedestal saying, I am better than them.

      ],
      "commentary": "We will be discussing chapter two, Sankhya Yoga. Yoga of Knowledge means uniting with the knowledge. The knowledge can be generally classified into two categories. One is secular knowledge and sacred. Secular is the knowledge about the world of objects. So even to get the secular knowledge, what we generally have to do is to make observations of the objects and then understand them.\n\nSo all the objects in the world which we know about today are not dependent on my personal observation, my personal understanding. The generations of scientists and mathematicians and and experimenters have gathered this information and passed them to us. So our knowledge is based on the efforts of generations of great thinkers. Sacred knowledge is something similar. So the knowledge about the self is also. It is not my personal experience right now, but I have to depend on the generations of sages who very carefully contemplated on the nature of the self.\n\nAnd those declarations are basically recorded in Vedas in our tradition. The knowledge they gained in their contemplation, in their observation, in their meditations are recorded as declarations and Vedas. The Veda means to vid is to know and the book of knowledge is Vedas. So there are four Vedas, Rukh, Sam, Yajur and Atharva. Based on the declarations of Vedas, there are six Darshan Shastras in our traditions. Various masters have taken those declarations and formulated a school of philosophy to explain the truth, the nature of the self.\n\nAnd that became the six schools of philosophy. In our tradition they can be generally categorized into three main categories. The first is called Tarka Logic. They come to the conclusion about what the truth is by logical conclusions. So that's called Tarka. And there are two great masters, Kannada and Gautam.\n\nThey form their Darsana, Sastra, which go Vaisheshika and Nyaya. Out of the six, five of them do not believe that God can be realized by meditation and knowledge. Only the last one, Vedanta, recognized the fact that God can be realized by meditation and knowledge. So as I said, they can be classified into three. The one is Tarka, which is logic. Second is Sankhya or Sankhya that is the logical enumeration of the facts.\n\nVery logical argument about what is the truth and how we come to that conclusion. And Kapil Muni is the author of Sankhya philosophy. But he did not include the Creator Ishvara or the God Principle in his philosophy. So his Darshan Sastra is near Iswara. Sankya Iswara is not included in his thesis. But then Patanjali included Isvara in the same Sankhya philosophy.\n\nSo it becomes Sa Iswara. Sankhya in the last one is called Mimasa Deliberations deliberating the fact, deliberating the facts which are available to us and come to the conclusion what is the real truth. So the declarations in Vedas are in basically two general categories. The earlier part of Vedas is called Karmakanda. The later part of the Vedas called Jnanakanda. The deliberations made based on the earlier part of the Vedas is called Purva Mimsa.\n\nJaimini Rusi made it detise on this Purva Mimsa methodical path of how to achieve the ultimate goal. The ultimate goal in Purva Vimansa is to go to heaven. All the good deeds of or good rituals. When you perform and acquire merits Punya then you are given a place to experience happiness and peace and bliss. And that state is called Swarga. So the goal of life as per Purva Vimansa is to achieve the Swarga based on the Jnanakanda.\n\nThe later part of the Vedas, the Darsam Shastra which was developed by Sage Badarayan is called Uttar Mimansa. So the Uttar Mimsa is the one recognized, the one single entity Brahman. So various teachers in Acharyas have taken the basis from one or the other of Darshana Shastra and created the schools of thoughts in our culture. And they are basically three Dvaita, the dualistic school. God and I are two different entities. They will never become one.\n\nGod is the Master and I am his servant. Dvaita Radhvacharya founded the school of thought. Rama Rajacharya established Visisht Advaita which says God is the whole and I'm part of F. So most of our Vaishnava Sampradha is based on Vishist Advaita. Then the last one is Adhvaita. Bhagavan Shankaracharya established the school of thought called Advaita based on Vedanta. Vedanta Literally means end of Vedas.\n\nEnd of Vedas we have Upanishads, the declarations in the Upanishads which says Myself and God is one and the same. Tattvamasi that thou art, that which I am seeking is none other than my own self. That school is called Advaita philosophy, non dualistic school of thought. So Bhagavad Gita the people have seen from all different points of view. In our tradition, Chinmaya, mission tradition or Sankarachira's tradition, we typically look at it from a non dualistic school of thought. So the chapter literally combines all these various schools of thoughts into understandable philosophy which takes the salient points of all three philosophies.\n\nBut in nature it is still Advaiti. And therefore we have seen in Gitamatvay Advaita Amru to varshed him which teaches us that myself and God's self is one and the same. So therefore this chapter is titled Sankhya Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge, predominantly based on the Sankhya philosophy of logical conclusions. So it is more scientific and modern in its approach towards the truth. All our Upanishads are in the form of dialogues between student and the teacher. Student ask question.\n\nThe teacher answer the question or give him guidance. So it is never to be taken without any understanding. If you don't understand, ask questions. Bhagavad Gita is basically in the same format. Bhagavan gives advice Arjuna, if he does not understand, he stops him and says let me tell you what I don't understand. So that's the tradition where you do not take anything for granted without understanding it.\n\nSo the chapter two Sankhya Yoga is now giving us a thumbnail picture of what the core declarations in Vedas in modern day presentation, effective presentation generally in three parts. Tell them what you're going to tell them, then tell them and then tell them what you told them. So you go to any professional meeting, you have an agenda. So you basically tell them. What we're going to discuss today is an agenda to that we hold a discussion on those items on the agenda. At the end of the meeting you say let's conclude what are the X and I, what we agreed on.\n\nSo that tradition is started by Bhagawan Vedvyasan, not our marketing guru. So chapter two will tell us what we will be discussing throughout Bhagavad Gita. Then we'll be discussing Bhagavad Gita and Chapter 18 will tell us what we Discussed all throughout Bhagavad Gita. Conclusion Action items what we have to do now, after that I have learned Bhagavad Gita. So the Sankhya Yoga is yoga of knowledge. Assuming that I don't have the knowledge right now, therefore I'm going to learn.\n\nSo chapter one gave us the scenario of our life situations. We typically live our life by complaining about injustices, discriminations, unfairness. And therefore what we do is we try to prepare ourselves for overcoming those obstacles. That's what we call education, training, internships. These are basically our preparations. Now is the preparation good enough to achieve success and happiness in life?\n\nThere's something more. All the graduates who come out from the university, they don't achieve exactly the same results. They're all prepared. They don't achieve the same result. Because there is something else that they differ from each other. Their inner strength and inner qualities and inner understandings of how to deal with the situation.\n\nWhen you encounter a situation, will you be able to take the right decision? What to do and what not to do is basically the training in the spiritual quest. If we have the clear understanding about what my position is in this situation and what my role is in this situation, then I'll be able to take the decision correctly. If I represent a company, when I go to a meeting with my client, if I have clear understanding what my role is as a company employee, then what my goal is here, then I will take the right decision. But if I misunderstand my role and introduce my personal objectives and personality into that discussion, then I as a company representative will fail. I actually never get chances to be on a selection side of an interview.\n\nTypically I'm more a candidate for pitching our services to other people. Once in a while I get an opportunity to be on a selection site to interview contractors. And I just had one interview like that. And after the three or four candidates we interviewed were obviously sitting down and making selections. So there were four or five people in that room. And you can tell that some people are completely unbiased and they really have no extra grind.\n\nBut then there are some people who say, yeah, but I know that guy and I like him. So I'm now injecting my personal bias into the decision making process. If you take that personal bias out of it, your decision will be relatively correct. But once you start seeing it through your personal bias, your decision will be deluded. May or may not be correct. So what we have seen in chapter one is when your personal attachments and biases are overwhelming you in facing the situation, the chances of your failure is much greater.\n\nSo you have seen the Arjuna when he was part of the Pandava's army as a general, he was very enthusiastic and very, very confident about his ability to fight. But as soon as he starts seeing other people as his relatives, he basically introduced his own attachment to them and that's where he got confused and broken down. So that was the scenario of the first chapter, basically gave us a mirror to our own situation why we fail in some situation and we succeed in other situations. The situations where I was overwhelmed by my own attachment and biases, it did not let me take the right decision. Situation where I have kept myself out of personal biases and saw the situation through a correct lens. If I was a part of a community, part of a country, as a citizen, or a part of a company, as a company representative, I take the right decision.\n\nSo chapter two obviously starts with continuation of the dialogue between Arjuna and Krishna. Mainly Arjuna spoke about himself. Krishna has not said anything. Sanjay has been narrating it to Dhritarashtra. So chapter two starts with Sanjaya is reporting back to Dhritarashtra which says Tam Tatha Krupaya wisdom Asudana simple reporting Dhritarashtra that this is what Krishna said to Arjuna. Because it may be possible that listening to Arjuna, Dhrutrashtra may have developed some hope that I think this is going to be the end of it.\n\nI think Arjuna is going to convince Krishna to let's pack our bags and go home. And when Arjuna is not there, either they all will go back or even if they fight, they are not going to win without Arjuna. So Dhritarasra may have some hope that the strategy is working. Arjuna is now broken down completely in this psychological warfare between what is right and wrong. Our emissaries went there, their emissaries came here. We put over argument, they put their we won over Arjuna.\n\nSo Sanjay says, wait a minute, let me tell you what Krishna told him. Tam Tatha Tam to him Tatha Das Krupaya Avistam. He is describing Arjuna's condition. Krupaya Avistam is overwhelmed by pity. Ashra Purna is crying. Can you imagine a general in the army on the battlefield, ready to fight, crying.",

      "commentary": "We will be discussing chapter two, Sankhya Yoga. Yoga of Knowledge means uniting with the knowledge. The knowledge can be generally classified into two categories. One is secular knowledge and sacred. Secular is the knowledge about the world of objects. So even to get the secular knowledge, what we generally have to do is to make observations of the objects and then understand them.\n\nSo all the objects in the world which we know about today are not dependent on my personal observation, my personal understanding. The generations of scientists and mathematicians and and experimenters have gathered this information and passed them to us. So our knowledge is based on the efforts of generations of great thinkers. Sacred knowledge is something similar. So the knowledge about the self is also. It is not my personal experience right now, but I have to depend on the generations of sages who very carefully contemplated on the nature of the self.\n\nAnd those declarations are basically recorded in Vedas in our tradition. The knowledge they gained in their contemplation, in their observation, in their meditations are recorded as declarations and Vedas. The Veda means to vid is to know and the book of knowledge is Vedas. So there are four Vedas, Rukh, Sam, Yajur and Atharva. Based on the declarations of Vedas, there are six Darshan Shastras in our traditions. Various masters have taken those declarations and formulated a school of philosophy to explain the truth, the nature of the self.\n\nAnd that became the six schools of philosophy. In our tradition they can be generally categorized into three main categories. The first is called Tarka Logic. They come to the conclusion about what the truth is by logical conclusions. So that's called Tarka. And there are two great masters, Kannada and Gautam.\n\nThey form their Darsana, Sastra, which go Vaisheshika and Nyaya. Out of the six, five of them do not believe that God can be realized by meditation and knowledge. Only the last one, Vedanta, recognized the fact that God can be realized by meditation and knowledge. So as I said, they can be classified into three. The one is Tarka, which is logic. Second is Sankhya or Sankhya that is the logical enumeration of the facts.\n\nVery logical argument about what is the truth and how we come to that conclusion. And Kapil Muni is the author of Sankhya philosophy. But he did not include the Creator Ishvara or the God Principle in his philosophy. So his Darshan Sastra is near Iswara. Sankya Iswara is not included in his thesis. But then Patanjali included Isvara in the same Sankhya philosophy.\n\nSo it becomes Sa Iswara. Sankhya in the last one is called Mimasa Deliberations deliberating the fact, deliberating the facts which are available to us and come to the conclusion what is the real truth. So the declarations in Vedas are in basically two general categories. The earlier part of Vedas is called Karmakanda. The later part of the Vedas called Jnanakanda. The deliberations made based on the earlier part of the Vedas is called Purva Mimsa.\n\nJaimini Rusi made it detise on this Purva Mimsa methodical path of how to achieve the ultimate goal. The ultimate goal in Purva Vimansa is to go to heaven. All the good deeds of or good rituals. When you perform and acquire merits Punya then you are given a place to experience happiness and peace and bliss. And that state is called Swarga. So the goal of life as per Purva Vimansa is to achieve the Swarga based on the Jnanakanda.\n\nThe later part of the Vedas, the Darsam Shastra which was developed by Sage Badarayan is called Uttar Mimansa. So the Uttar Mimsa is the one recognized, the one single entity Brahman. So various teachers in Acharyas have taken the basis from one or the other of Darshana Shastra and created the schools of thoughts in our culture. And they are basically three Dvaita, the dualistic school. God and I are two different entities. They will never become one.\n\nGod is the Master and I am his servant. Dvaita Radhvacharya founded the school of thought. Rama Rajacharya established Visisht Advaita which says God is the whole and I'm part of F. So most of our Vaishnava Sampradha is based on Vishist Advaita. Then the last one is Adhvaita. Bhagavan Shankaracharya established the school of thought called Advaita based on Vedanta. Vedanta Literally means end of Vedas.\n\nEnd of Vedas we have Upanishads, the declarations in the Upanishads which says Myself and God is one and the same. Tattvamasi that thou art, that which I am seeking is none other than my own self. That school is called Advaita philosophy, non dualistic school of thought. So Bhagavad Gita the people have seen from all different points of view. In our tradition, Chinmaya, mission tradition or Sankarachira's tradition, we typically look at it from a non dualistic school of thought. So the chapter literally combines all these various schools of thoughts into understandable philosophy which takes the salient points of all three philosophies.\n\nBut in nature it is still Advaiti. And therefore we have seen in Gitamatvay Advaita Amru to varshed him which teaches us that myself and God's self is one and the same. So therefore this chapter is titled Sankhya Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge, predominantly based on the Sankhya philosophy of logical conclusions. So it is more scientific and modern in its approach towards the truth. All our Upanishads are in the form of dialogues between student and the teacher. Student ask question.\n\nThe teacher answer the question or give him guidance. So it is never to be taken without any understanding. If you don't understand, ask questions. Bhagavad Gita is basically in the same format. Bhagavan gives advice Arjuna, if he does not understand, he stops him and says let me tell you what I don't understand. So that's the tradition where you do not take anything for granted without understanding it.\n\nSo the chapter two Sankhya Yoga is now giving us a thumbnail picture of what the core declarations in Vedas in modern day presentation, effective presentation generally in three parts. Tell them what you're going to tell them, then tell them and then tell them what you told them. So you go to any professional meeting, you have an agenda. So you basically tell them. What we're going to discuss today is an agenda to that we hold a discussion on those items on the agenda. At the end of the meeting you say let's conclude what are the X and I, what we agreed on.\n\nSo that tradition is started by Bhagawan Vedvyasan, not our marketing guru. So chapter two will tell us what we will be discussing throughout Bhagavad Gita. Then we'll be discussing Bhagavad Gita and Chapter 18 will tell us what we Discussed all throughout Bhagavad Gita. Conclusion Action items what we have to do now, after that I have learned Bhagavad Gita. So the Sankhya Yoga is yoga of knowledge. Assuming that I don't have the knowledge right now, therefore I'm going to learn.\n\nSo chapter one gave us the scenario of our life situations. We typically live our life by complaining about injustices, discriminations, unfairness. And therefore what we do is we try to prepare ourselves for overcoming those obstacles. That's what we call education, training, internships. These are basically our preparations. Now is the preparation good enough to achieve success and happiness in life?\n\nThere's something more. All the graduates who come out from the university, they don't achieve exactly the same results. They're all prepared. They don't achieve the same result. Because there is something else that they differ from each other. Their inner strength and inner qualities and inner understandings of how to deal with the situation.\n\nWhen you encounter a situation, will you be able to take the right decision? What to do and what not to do is basically the training in the spiritual quest. If we have the clear understanding about what my position is in this situation and what my role is in this situation, then I'll be able to take the decision correctly. If I represent a company, when I go to a meeting with my client, if I have clear understanding what my role is as a company employee, then what my goal is here, then I will take the right decision. But if I misunderstand my role and introduce my personal objectives and personality into that discussion, then I as a company representative will fail. I actually never get chances to be on a selection side of an interview.\n\nTypically I'm more a candidate for pitching our services to other people. Once in a while I get an opportunity to be on a selection site to interview contractors. And I just had one interview like that. And after the three or four candidates we interviewed were obviously sitting down and making selections. So there were four or five people in that room. And you can tell that some people are completely unbiased and they really have no extra grind.\n\nBut then there are some people who say, yeah, but I know that guy and I like him. So I'm now injecting my personal bias into the decision making process. If you take that personal bias out of it, your decision will be relatively correct. But once you start seeing it through your personal bias, your decision will be deluded. May or may not be correct. So what we have seen in chapter one is when your personal attachments and biases are overwhelming you in facing the situation, the chances of your failure is much greater.\n\nSo you have seen the Arjuna when he was part of the Pandava's army as a general, he was very enthusiastic and very, very confident about his ability to fight. But as soon as he starts seeing other people as his relatives, he basically introduced his own attachment to them and that's where he got confused and broken down. So that was the scenario of the first chapter, basically gave us a mirror to our own situation why we fail in some situation and we succeed in other situations. The situations where I was overwhelmed by my own attachment and biases, it did not let me take the right decision. Situation where I have kept myself out of personal biases and saw the situation through a correct lens. If I was a part of a community, part of a country, as a citizen, or a part of a company, as a company representative, I take the right decision.\n\nSo chapter two obviously starts with continuation of the dialogue between Arjuna and Krishna. Mainly Arjuna spoke about himself. Krishna has not said anything. Sanjay has been narrating it to Dhritarashtra. So chapter two starts with Sanjaya is reporting back to Dhritarashtra which says Tam Tatha Krupaya wisdom Asudana simple reporting Dhritarashtra that this is what Krishna said to Arjuna. Because it may be possible that listening to Arjuna, Dhrutrashtra may have developed some hope that I think this is going to be the end of it.\n\nI think Arjuna is going to convince Krishna to let's pack our bags and go home. And when Arjuna is not there, either they all will go back or even if they fight, they are not going to win without Arjuna. So Dhritarasra may have some hope that the strategy is working. Arjuna is now broken down completely in this psychological warfare between what is right and wrong. Our emissaries went there, their emissaries came here. We put over argument, they put their we won over Arjuna.\n\nSo Sanjay says, wait a minute, let me tell you what Krishna told him. Tam Tatha Tam to him Tatha Das Krupaya Avistam. He is describing Arjuna's condition. Krupaya Avistam is overwhelmed by pity. Ashra Purna is crying. Can you imagine a general in the army on the battlefield, ready to fight, crying.",
      "reflection": "Take a few moments today to consider: What would change if you truly believed that your essential Self cannot be harmed? Not as a comforting platitude, but as a lived reality?\n\nWhen fear arises today, experiment with asking: 'What is it that's aware of this fear?' That awareness itself is untouched by what it witnesses. This is the key insight of these verses.\n\nNotice the experiences of pleasure and pain that come to you today. Can you see them as contacts between your senses and sense objects—temporary, impermanent, coming and going like waves? Bear them with equanimity, knowing they will pass."

      ],
      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter two. We have still seen in the first few _Verses_ continuing to argue about why he feels that he should not be fighting. Obviously, we have spent the whole chapter one listening to his argument. Then Bhagavan told him that why are you behaving this way? Where does this un Aryan like importance come upon you? In other words, this behavior which is not fitting to somebody who is civilized and trained about Dharma.\n\nAs we have seen that in our culture everything is defined by Dharma. So whatever the basic qualities of the thing are being that defines who that person is. So we have broadly a Manavadharma, what is the Dharma of a human being? We generally define the Dharma of a human being is to act according to his true self, which is Divinity, the expression of the God. So our Dharma as human being is to align our actions in line with the divinity. So everything we do should be keeping in mind that my true Dharma is divinity and therefore I'm acting in that manner.\n\nThen obviously we come down to now that I have aligned myself to divinity. I'm now just playing a role in this life or in this state, or in this time. Now, whatever the role I'm playing at that time will define what my Dharma is. My Dharma from Monday through Friday is to act as an architect. So that time, what is right for me is defined by the role I have taken. On Sunday it will be different.\n\nIf I start talking about architecture here, it will be very inappropriate. So my Dharma changes as per the time and role I am taking. There is no universally I can say that if I behave this way will be appropriate. I have to find what is the time I am in and what the role I have taken and then find what is my appropriate dharma. Arjuna right now is in a battlefield leading an army. Their army is depending on him on his strength and capability to win this war.\n\nAnd now he wants to go back. Therefore Bhagavan said where the Un Aryan like behavior come upon you because as an Arya he was taught what is Dharma of a Kshatriya Kshatriya Dharma is when he is facing an enemy is to fight. Once he has decided this is the right battle, he has to fight. So Bhagavanti, where does this behavior come from? Is it something that somebody was not clear enough while teaching you what a Dharmapakshatriya is? Or what is your Dharma as a prince?\n\nOr what is your Dharma as one of the Pandavas? Where is this behavior come from? So Arjuna obviously was not expecting that. He was expecting some sympathetic words. So he continues to make his point. But then he realized that there may be something I'm completely missing here, that all my arguments up till now has not made any impression on Krishna.\n\nSo there may be something I need to think about what is right. And maybe I'm not capable of thinking what is right. So the next few _Verses_ says, karpanya doso aphatva Bhavaha prachami tv. I made my argument thinking that I'm. What I'm thinking is right, that this is my Dharma. Not to kill my teacher, not to kill my great grandfather, not to kill my cousins.\n\nFor a while I thought, that's my Dharma. Now you are telling me that that's not my Dharma, that this is not the Arya like behavior. Therefore Dharma asam mudhe daha. I am completely confused about what is Dharma right now. I do not know what my Dharma is. Pruchamitam, I am asking you, someone who is confused about his Dharma.\n\nWhat is my Dharma right now? What am I supposed to be doing at this time? Karpanya do so Aphatvah. My own nature is overwhelmed by this pity, pity on me that I am facing the situation. I don't know what I am doing. Normally I'm in my control.\n\nNormally I know what I'm supposed to be doing from my training, from my own intellect. I know in this situation how I should be behaving, which is most appropriate. But looks like my whole subhava. My nature is overwhelmed by this pity about my own situation which I'm facing. Therefore I am Dharma. I am completely deluded about what is my Dharma.\n\nIs it not killing them is my Dharma. Not fighting this war is my Dharma or fighting this war is my Dharma. Yat sreihaat nishitam bruhi tanme. Therefore you tell me with definitive guidance what is right for me. Up till now he was using his own intellect and ego to come up with what is right and wrong. Then he put forward his argument.\n\nThis is something, an indication to us that sometimes what we think through our intellect may not be right. We do come up with all this argument about why I'm doing this. You know, why I don't make any donation because they are all corrupt and all these organizations are corrupt. Why should I be supporting them? All this nice argument which I come up with, they may be just my own delusion. As long as I hang on to my ego and my intellect to come up with the right answer.\n\nThere may be right answer or there may be wrong answer. So right now, because you are telling me that what I was thinking is not right, I'm assuming that I'm completely deluded. Now you tell me what is right for me. We go to ask advice, but typically we are not really ready to listen to the advice. We go to somebody and say, you know, this is what I'm doing. This is the situation.\n\nWhat do you think I should be doing? You know, the best thing for you to do is this. And you say, yeah, but I don't think I'll be able to. Because then you can say, well, what does he. I mean, obviously he doesn't know everything. We know what situation we are in.\n\nWe are really asking for advice just to get confirmation of what I'm thinking that somebody, yes, yes, you are right. You shouldn't be doing that. I think what you did is very right. That would be looking. We just need little pat on our back saying, I think, Neil, you're so smart. You figured out what to do.\n\nWe are not really looking for advice. Sisya Deham, I am your student. In our culture, Guru Sishya, relationship is very unique. It is very different from a father and a son or a mother and a son or a friend. Shishya completely surrenders to the Guru once he finds that the Guru is appropriate. After that, there is no argument about what Guru says.\n\nOnce he has surrendered to the Guru, then Guru tells him what to do and he does it. It is not a relationship between a professor and a student. Students can argue here, there. The Guru says, once I have decided that's my Guru, I have completely surrendered to him. And then whatever he says without any argument, I will follow. Because I have done all my homework before.\n\nWhether that should be my Guru or I shouldn't be learning this particular thing from him or not. Once he has done that, I have completely surrendered. So he makes it clear to Krishna that I'm not just simply asking advice from you because I'm confused. I'm surrendering to you. Therefore, now you tell me what is Good for me and I will follow that. Sadhimam Tvam Prapannam I have taken refuge in you.\n\nI have completely given up that I can come up with the right answer in this situation what is right and wrong. But I am now your student. You who will tell me what is right and wrong for me. And whatever you tell me, I will do it now. One thing I learned many, many years ago and not learned from any of the swami, but Dr. Naidu in whose house we used to do the classes. And he actually made me understand what a surrender is.\n\nSurrender is something when you feel completely helpless. We go to temple and say I surrender to you Lord. But we are really not. We really want to make sure that I am in control, who is behind me, who is ahead of me. They would be paying attention that I am putting donation. So we are not really surrendering.\n\nSurrender is when I completely feel helpless. In the example Dr. Naidu gave me, which really stuck with me. Two armies fighting and the one king, when he decides he's going to surrender, when is he going to surrender? When he feels completely helpless that there is no way he's going to win this battle, he surrenders to the other army. That point he's completely helpless. He's completely at the mercy of their other king.\n\nThe story of Eporus and Alexander when he surrendered, Alexander asked him, how do you want me to treat you? And Polish said, treat me like a king. Because at that point he has no other choice but to say I surrender. Now you can treat me the way you want. But you asked me, so I'm telling you, treat me like a king. So that's a surrender.\n\nSurrender when you really feel that you don't have any other way out here. And I surrender to you. Arjuna came to that point that my ego, my intellect, my all this training is of no value right now. I can't come up with an answer which is going to be satisfactory to me or to you. Therefore I'm now your student. I'm asking you to teach me what is right and wrong.\n\nThen tell me without any options. If Krishna get two options. One option is do this. And second, I'm again confused. Don't give me that option. You know, when I came to this country, I must have told this story many, many times.\n\nBut when I was in Africa to get a new car, you had to get in line, you had to register yourself. And then after two or three years you get notification from the dealership saying now your car has arrived and you can get it. So to get a new car then everybody wants to get a new car. Everybody will come and congratulate you. Oh, that's a new car. Oh, when did you register it?\n\nSo my boss told me go and get a new car. So I come and tell everybody and they said, your boss is joking with you because by the time you get your new car you probably will be working someplace else. So I made all my effort to use all my influence to get a new car within six months. And I was very proud. And as people have predicted, after eight months I was in the United States. I told my brother in law that it looks like there is no public transportation in this country.\n\nHe said no problem, we'll go over the weekend. Do you want to wait till weekend? He said, don't worry, we'll go over the weekend. Over the weekend he takes me first to a Chrysler's dealership and there are cars till my eyes can see in the parking lot or that lot. And he said, you can select any car, but let me tell you. And I said, you just tell me which car I should be buying.\n\nHe said, this is just Chrysler. Then we are going to go to gm, then we'll go to Ford and then if you like we can go to Toyota or other Japanese car. And I say I'm getting dizzy, you just tell me which car I should be buying.",
      "reflection": "Take a few moments today to consider: What would change if you truly believed that your essential Self cannot be harmed? Not as a comforting platitude, but as a lived reality?\n\nWhen fear arises today, experiment with asking: 'What is it that's aware of this fear?' That awareness itself is untouched by what it witnesses. This is the key insight of these verses.\n\nNotice the experiences of pleasure and pain that come to you today. Can you see them as contacts between your senses and sense objects—temporary, impermanent, coming and going like waves? Bear them with equanimity, knowing they will pass."

Therefore you tell me with definitive guidance what is right for me. Up till now he was using his own intellect and ego to come up with what is right and wrong. Then he put forward his argument.\n\nThis is something, an indication to us that sometimes what we think through our intellect may not be right. We do come up with all this argument about why I'm doing this. You know, why I don't make any donation because they are all corrupt and all these organizations are corrupt. Why should I be supporting them? All this nice argument which I come up with, they may be just my own delusion. As long as I hang on to my ego and my intellect to come up with the right answer.\n\nThere may be right answer or there may be wrong answer. So right now, because you are telling me that what I was thinking is not right, I'm assuming that I'm completely deluded. Now you tell me what is right for me. We go to ask advice, but typically we are not really ready to listen to the advice. We go to somebody and say, you know, this is what I'm doing. This is the situation.\n\nWhat do you think I should be doing? You know, the best thing for you to do is this. And you say, yeah, but I don't think I'll be able to. Because then you can say, well, what does he. I mean, obviously he doesn't know everything. We know what situation we are in.\n\nWe are really asking for advice just to get confirmation of what I'm thinking that somebody, yes, yes, you are right. You shouldn't be doing that. I think what you did is very right. That would be looking. We just need little pat on our back saying, I think, Neil, you're so smart. You figured out what to do.\n\nWe are not really looking for advice. Sisya Deham, I am your student. In our culture, Guru Sishya, relationship is very unique. It is very different from a father and a son or a mother and a son or a friend. Shishya completely surrenders to the Guru once he finds that the Guru is appropriate. After that, there is no argument about what Guru says.\n\nOnce he has surrendered to the Guru, then Guru tells him what to do and he does it. It is not a relationship between a professor and a student. Students can argue here, there. The Guru says, once I have decided that's my Guru, I have completely surrendered to him. And then whatever he says without any argument, I will follow. Because I have done all my homework before.\n\nWhether that should be my Guru or I shouldn't be learning this particular thing from him or not. Once he has done that, I have completely surrendered. So he makes it clear to Krishna that I'm not just simply asking advice from you because I'm confused. I'm surrendering to you. Therefore, now you tell me what is Good for me and I will follow that. Sadhimam Tvam Prapannam I have taken refuge in you.\n\nI have completely given up that I can come up with the right answer in this situation what is right and wrong. But I am now your student. You who will tell me what is right and wrong for me. And whatever you tell me, I will do it now. One thing I learned many, many years ago and not learned from any of the swami, but Dr. Naidu in whose house we used to do the classes. And he actually made me understand what a surrender is.\n\nSurrender is something when you feel completely helpless. We go to temple and say I surrender to you Lord. But we are really not. We really want to make sure that I am in control, who is behind me, who is ahead of me. They would be paying attention that I am putting donation. So we are not really surrendering.\n\nSurrender is when I completely feel helpless. In the example Dr. Naidu gave me, which really stuck with me. Two armies fighting and the one king, when he decides he's going to surrender, when is he going to surrender? When he feels completely helpless that there is no way he's going to win this battle, he surrenders to the other army. That point he's completely helpless. He's completely at the mercy of their other king.\n\nThe story of Eporus and Alexander when he surrendered, Alexander asked him, how do you want me to treat you? And Polish said, treat me like a king. Because at that point he has no other choice but to say I surrender. Now you can treat me the way you want. But you asked me, so I'm telling you, treat me like a king. So that's a surrender.\n\nSurrender when you really feel that you don't have any other way out here. And I surrender to you. Arjuna came to that point that my ego, my intellect, my all this training is of no value right now. I can't come up with an answer which is going to be satisfactory to me or to you. Therefore I'm now your student. I'm asking you to teach me what is right and wrong.\n\nThen tell me without any options. If Krishna get two options. One option is do this. And second, I'm again confused. Don't give me that option. You know, when I came to this country, I must have told this story many, many times.\n\nBut when I was in Africa to get a new car, you had to get in line, you had to register yourself. And then after two or three years you get notification from the dealership saying now your car has arrived and you can get it. So to get a new car then everybody wants to get a new car. Everybody will come and congratulate you. Oh, that's a new car. Oh, when did you register it?\n\nSo my boss told me go and get a new car. So I come and tell everybody and they said, your boss is joking with you because by the time you get your new car you probably will be working someplace else. So I made all my effort to use all my influence to get a new car within six months. And I was very proud. And as people have predicted, after eight months I was in the United States. I told my brother in law that it looks like there is no public transportation in this country.\n\nHe said no problem, we'll go over the weekend. Do you want to wait till weekend? He said, don't worry, we'll go over the weekend. Over the weekend he takes me first to a Chrysler's dealership and there are cars till my eyes can see in the parking lot or that lot. And he said, you can select any car, but let me tell you. And I said, you just tell me which car I should be buying.\n\nHe said, this is just Chrysler. Then we are going to go to gm, then we'll go to Ford and then if you like we can go to Toyota or other Japanese car. And I say I'm getting dizzy, you just tell me which car I should be buying.",
      "reflection": "Take a few moments today to consider: What would change if you truly believed that your essential Self cannot be harmed? Not as a comforting platitude, but as a lived reality?\n\nWhen fear arises today, experiment with asking: 'What is it that's aware of this fear?' That awareness itself is untouched by what it witnesses. This is the key insight of these verses.\n\nNotice the experiences of pleasure and pain that come to you today. Can you see them as contacts between your senses and sense objects—temporary, impermanent, coming and going like waves? Bear them with equanimity, knowing they will pass."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 2, Sankhya Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge. And so far we had seen that just in the beginning, right away, as soon as Bhagavan started his discourse, he came out without waffling about what is the truth. He says, you and I are imperishable. So are all these people which you see them around you, all these kings. A complete paradigm shift for a normal person who considers himself to be perishable. I was born at one time and I'll die at other time.\n\nIn between is my life. So I'm a perishable entity. Bhagavan said, no, neither you nor I are perishable. There was never a time that you did not exist, or I did not exist, or all these people around you did not exist. The existence is permanent. I may not exist in the same form and state.\n\nI'm existing today as I existed as a child before and I'm existing as an old man now, but still I exist for that I. There is no non existence. So that's a complete paradigm shift and without any explanation. Bhagavan said, first thing you should know is you're imperishable. And then he goes into the explanation because he realized that at the stage Arjuna is a simple advice of this is your action, this is your duties. Well, you should do this.\n\nForget about what they did in the past. It's not going to work. This is a disease which has to be cured at its root cause. The root cause of all the disease or all the problems we have is the desire and attachment which is born out of my ignorance about what the reality is. If I'm disillusioned, I'm deluded by this world and my relationship with it. The only way you can cure it is cure the root cause of it.\n\nTherefore, Bhagavan Buddha said, cure the disease of desire and everything will be cured no matter how much we help somebody. But as long as the root cause is not cured, it will be a band aid solution as we call it. In architecture, even though it's borrowed from medical, we call it's a band aid solution. You want to permanently. Well, let's demolish this building, build a new one. Bhagavan realized that just telling Arjuna what is his duty now and what will be right for you is not going to help.\n\nLet's start from the beginning. What is your problem? You are afraid that you will be killing these people? Well, you are incapable of killing these people because they are imperishable. The other day our Dr. Chinmayananda Lothe was trying to tell us how indestructible his glasses are. And he said, you know the one good thing about this glasses you can do.\n\nAnd by the time he finishes sentence, it broke into two so whole his demonstration of indestructibility of his glasses fell apart right in front of him. Boy, I need a new glasses now. So sometimes what we consider imperishable turns out to be perishable. Things which are we consider indestructible. Imperishable turns out to be perishable. So in this life, what I consider is my security blanket, which I consider to be imperishable.\n\nBecause I think I'm in control. I have taken care of everything. The things which I rely on as dependable may turn out to be undependable. So from Arjuna's point of view, he was depending on his relationship and knowledge about the importance of his teachers and his grandfather. My family, my dynasty, my culture depends on them. And Bhagavan said, that may not be true.\n\nHowever, what is true is you are indestructible. And they are indestructible at the core of their being. Then he says, why I don't feel it that way. He know Yasmin Yatha Dehe Kaumaram Yavanam Jira. The classical example we use it all the time is just as I have changed from my existence as a child to young man to an adult, and I still remain the same. The feeling which I have as I is exactly same today as it was when I was a young man and when I was a child.\n\nI always see other people as old people. I never see myself as old people. And it's a very strange phenomenon. I don't know whether anybody can vouch for. I can tell you I never feel I'm old. You know, I actually feel the same way when I was.\n\nI'm young, I can do that. These people are old, they cannot do it. Then I realized that he's actually younger than me. You know, Swami Dheeranda used to come to Richmond. They will say, swami, let me take your bag. And he'll say, moonkanish, forget I'm much younger than you are.\n\nI have more strength than you do, so don't worry about my bag. But we always feel at the core, core of our heart were indestructible. The same person as I was when I used to have all the real strength. That's why the middle aged people go to play the sports which they are supposed not to play at their age. I want to play cricket. I really like cricket because I used to play cricket when I was 20 years old.\n\nWell, you try that today. Then after about two or three games, you realize that that's not the thing you should be doing at the age of whatever you are today. So at the core of your being there is no change. Change is happening in the outside existence which you have, which is your body. Just as you have changed from a young age to old age. The same way this self will move from one body to another.\n\nIntroduce the concept of reincarnation right away in the second verse only first verse he said, you're indestructible. Second verse he says, this death is nothing. So these are very shock treatment to somebody whose mind has gone into a complete delusion. They can't see the reality as is. And as all these psychiatric treatments used to be shock treatment, you have to jolt him out of that state. Basically, Bhagawan is giving a shock treatment.\n\nWe are all deluded by our own reality. Our own security blankets our own thinking about what is right and wrong. And he said, starts from this you are imperishable. You will continue to exist in one form or another. Therefore, in any culture, and particularly in ours, suicide is never prescribed. Because suicide does not solve anything.\n\nIt exactly takes the same mental problem you have to the next stage of life. Running away from my problems. Swamiji used to say, if you are unhappy here, if you say, I am so unhappy in us, I am going to go to India and then I will be happy. You will be exactly same unhappy person in India. Except the place will change. As long as the internal climate you are taking with you, things are not going to change for you.\n\nSo you have to change your internal climate for that. Bhagavan gives you a shock treatment. First is you're imperishable, not perishable. Secondly, death is not going to change anything. You will start all over again. And then he says, why Then we feel what we feel in our day to day life.\n\nThese changes in my life occurring, some are pleasant and some are unpleasant. So it's in matra sparsaha tu kunteya sita ushna sukha du kadaha. Here is the simple analysis. How your experiences are defined by you and for you senses. When come in contact with the sense objects, it gives rise to the experience of pleasure and pain, heat and cold. Not two people feel the same way about their climate.\n\nSomebody in the room, it's too hot. Neil, can you check another person say I'm perfectly fine, don't touch it. Meena will say it's too hot and also no, it's too cold. And she will say it's too cold. I say no, it's too hot. I think our thermostats work differently.\n\nInternal thermostats. So the experience of heat and cold depends on two things. Outside world which has obviously this condition, but also my sensitivity. My senses, its own sensitivity decides whether it is pleasant or unpleasant. Swamiji's classical example of cigarette smoker cigarette which gives one person a heavenly experience. I'm a reform smoker, so I know exactly what I'm talking about.\n\nWhen I was in college and when we are in the dining hall, not interested in meal, when can I finish there and go and have a cigarette outside? That was more enjoyable. The cigarette after the dinner or lunch or any time. Then the lunch itself or dinner itself. Same cigarette gives a repulsive reaction from somebody else. Now I'm a reformed smoker, so I'm the worst one and I can't really tolerate even the smell of cigarette.\n\nWe have one smoker in my office. Every about an hour he goes out, smokes and come back. And then he feels obliged. Every time he goes out there he needs to say something to me and I say, well, you go away. I really don't want to talk to you right now because you're smelling cigarettes all over my office. The same object which gives pleasure to someone, gives pain to someone.\n\nWhat it tells you is object has no capacity to give a pleasure or pain. It is your senses which decides which is pleasurable or painful. So Bhagavan said, matras parsaha tu kaunteya sita ushna sukhdukh daha. This context between the senses and sense objects are the cause of all the experiences you have. So if you remove yourself from the senses because you don't think you are your senses, then these experiences are not yours. Experiences of my car are not Mine.\n\nSo my experience of my eyes, I consider mine and I consider my eye to be me. But I don't consider my glasses to be me. My glasses are not me because I can go to lens craft and get it done in one hour. I know that my eye, I cannot. I have to rely on Santa Ramji and his colleagues to say, make sure that it's functioning well because of that attachment, that identification with the eye which makes me feel it is me. But one says this identification with your senses, that your senses are.\n\nYou transfer all those experiences to you, whether it is heat or cold, pain or pleasure. So understand, these are not your experiences. These are the experiences of these senses when they come in contact with sense objects. And it depends on your sensitivity, your sense of you will feel whether pleasure or pain. My mother, I remember she can pick up the burning charcoal and then put it. I said, don't you need it?\n\nHe said, no, I'm fine. Now I can't even pick up the hot cup of tea because her fingers are numbed by all those cooking. He can pick up charcoal and put it in. When we came to this country, you had to get the fingerprinting done at the airport because you come on a green card. Well, obviously they have a green card. They make your fingerprint, put it on a green card, sealed it in their plastic and give it.\n\nThat's a green card, sir. Meena comes after me. The guy tried and tried and tried and tried and couldn't get a fingerprint done. Sir, I'm sorry, but your wife probably have to go to the downtown in Houston to get this fingerprint done. We don't have capability to take a fingerprint. I said, what's the problem?\n\nHe said, because her rigis are all worn out because of what are the chemicals you use and all that while doing your dishes. So we may have special machine in downtown Houston which may be able to do it, but we can't do it.",
      "reflection": "Take a few moments today to consider: What would change if you truly believed that your essential Self cannot be harmed? Not as a comforting platitude, but as a lived reality?\n\nWhen fear arises today, experiment with asking: 'What is it that's aware of this fear?' That awareness itself is untouched by what it witnesses. This is the key insight of these verses.\n\nNotice the experiences of pleasure and pain that come to you today. Can you see them as contacts between your senses and sense objects—temporary, impermanent, coming and going like waves? Bear them with equanimity, knowing they will pass."

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing Chapter 2, Sankhya Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge. This is the knowledge about our true self. So verse 11 through 30 give us the Upanishaddic definition of what the self is all about. So Bhagawan starts with telling Arjuna that you should start looking at this world very differently. It is something like for any corporate planning there is short term planning and a long term planning. So there are some things you have to look at it from short term planning.\n\nYou have to get these things done during this quarter, but then you also have to look at it on a long term basis what will be in next 10 years. So Bhagavan says that right now we are looking at the world from a very short narrow perspective which is limited to this life. But this life is not the end by itself. This life is nothing but just a fraction of your own existence. So he starts with saying, you are worrying about these people. They are not worth worrying about.\n\nNo relatives of yours or friend of yours you should worry about whether he is dead or alive. It was a very shocking declaration to Arjuna, why shouldn't I be worrying about my own kith and kin? When you look at it from this narrow perspective, it will seem that something is good or bad. But we have learned that good and bad is a relative perspective. So what is maybe good in a short term may not be good in a long term. That's why we have come across two terms.\n\nPrayas is pleasant temporarily. Shreyas is good forever. That which is always good is Shreyas. That which is temporarily pleasant is Prayas. So the situation I see may be pleasant for now from Arjuna's point of running away from this battle is pleasant. Less things to worry about, but it's not pleasant in the long run.\n\nYou can allow these criminals to continue doing their crimes and this non Aryan like behavior, as Krishna puts it, the way these people are behaving is not fit to be an Aryan. Therefore to establish Dharma of Arya Bhart, it is your duty as the Kshatriya to fight this war. That's basically Krishna's message here. So he said, you shouldn't be worrying about them. But then he starts from the widest perspective saying the existence for any being is eternal. We are eternal beings.\n\nThere was never a time where you were not there, or I was not there, or these kings were not there. So we are all eternal beings, immortal beings. We consider ourselves to be mortal. So that's basically the paradigm shift for Arjuna and all of us. How to look at our life. There will be a narrow perspective.\n\nThere is a relative reality. When there is a ice cube in my glass, it has this relative reality. The ice cube is very solid. But if I wait long enough, that ice cube will be gone. There will be just water. Water relatively has a longer existence than ice cube.\n\nIce cube is a very short term existence. I, as an intelligent being who use ice before, I know that that if I really want to use this ice, I have to use it as quickly as possible. Otherwise the ice will go away. There won't be any ice. So if I want to say you have to look at this situation from a wider perspective, that these people cannot be killed. And therefore he said, just as they have progressed from one existence to another, you have progressed one existence to another in your life.\n\nFrom a childhood to adulthood and to old age, you will also migrate to the new state of existence. Deha Antara Transferring one body to another, there will not be any different then your migration from childhood to adulthood. Therefore, wise person who has understood this fundamental truth will not get confused. One who has understood the widest perspective of existence, he will not be worried about a small change in existence. When you understand the water and ice. If the ice become water, he does not get upset.\n\nMaybe you have to put it back into the freezer if you want more ice in the ice cube tray. So we know that the existence is permanent. Bhagavan says, but there may be a temporary consequences of me dealing with this world. Those experiences in my life create. Sukha nadukha matraha sparsaha tu kamteya. When sense organs come in contact with sense objects, it will create an experience.\n\nThat experience, depending on the qualities of your sense organs, will be either pleasant or unpleasant. One experience which is pleasant to me may be unpleasant to somebody else. Jumping from 50ft on a bungee jumping is pleasant to somebody. It will not be pleasant for me. Same experience can give two different experiences to two different people in the same set of circumstances. Depending on his own equipment, depending on my mind if it is rainy outside it may be unpleasant.\n\nBut if I'm a farmer or a gardener, it may be a pleasant experience. The bhagawan said, matrahas parsaha tu kunteya sita ushna sukh dukadah. They give these experiences of sukhendukha. They are nothing but perceptions of your mind. And therefore he said, taam titiksha bharad. You have no other choice.\n\nWhether it's pleasant or unpleasant, must to bear them. Know that they are temporary. They have beginning and an end. And therefore any pleasant experience. Also don't get too excited, too elated because it will also an end. Every other day we hear about recession and then the next day we hear about no, no, the market is going to keep going.\n\nHow long we know for sure there will be recession sometime. We just hope it will not be before I retire, that's all. So every experience has a beginning and end. While we are experiencing, if we remember that, that this is a temporary experience, we will not get too invested in that experience. We get too invested in their experience. That's where we get either too excited or elated or too depressed.\n\nI said, the right way to live, bear them all pleasant and unpleasant. And then Bhagavan now defines what is the nature of the self. So other day I also had a new revelation about the ownership of this building. So my condo administrator came to me as a Krishna to explain to me what I own and what I don't own. We obviously all of you know that Meena and I own this building. So we always say, well, we own this building.\n\nEverything outside parking lot is common area. We own this building. There was clear understanding the last about 14 years we owned this building or 16 years we owned this building. The other day we had a water damage. Hot water heater broke and it was just spraying out water all over the bathroom. So I had to obviously call.\n\nI actually called fire department because I didn't know what to do. By the time fire department came, the guy who was cleaning the carpet, he figured out there is a shut off valve outside. He shut it off, everything was fine. But when I reported it to our condo guy, he said, well, I'll come down Neil and check it out whether there's any damage in the attic. He walked through my attic. He found that we were storing old drawings and files in our attic.\n\nWe have storage trusses. He said, Neil, I don't want to be a pain in your neck, but you're not supposed to store anything in an airtake he said, why is that? He said, because you only own building from your ceiling to the top of the floor. Airtake does not belong to you. I said, who owns the attic? He said, the condo association.\n\nI said, are you serious? They say, yeah, yeah, you only own from the ceiling to the floor. They said, what about below the floor? He said, that also condo association. He said, what about outside? He said, you only went from the inside face of your exterior wall to the other side interior face of exterior wall.\n\nHe said, who owns the exterior walls? There's a condo association. So he said, who owns the building? He said, neil, you own the space within the exterior walls, in the ceiling and a floor. They say, nothing concrete, which I can call a building is mine. I said, no, none of that is yours.\n\nYou as a condo owner only own the space. Do you mean to say the condo association tomorrow can decide that they want to take the roof away because they own the roof and then they take the four walls away? Yeah, technically they own. Now, how about the ground below? They own the ground below too. All you own is space within four walls, floor and a ceiling.\n\nThey say, okay, you try to remove that. I'll tell you, demarcate my space from outside space, inside space, because my condo is just the space. You can remove floors, wall and ceiling as condo owner association. You won't be able to take this space away because I own this space. Now, that's a completely different way to look at this condo ownership. But first of all, the bank had the mortgage on this space, so I owe them money.\n\nAnd then if I want to sell something, I only own the space. There is nothing which is tangible, which I can say I own it outrightly. I have to give permission, whatever that is. But technically free and clear. What I own is space inside this building, even though it has no value without the space, walls, floor and ceiling has no meaning whatsoever. The space is defining the value for the conditioning, but the conditionings are defining the limitations of the space.\n\nBhagavan said to Arjuna that you have to start looking at your relationship to your teacher and your grandfather in a very different way. And therefore he says, avinasi tu tadviddhi en sarvam idam tatham. So what is my relationship with that self which is residing in all these beings? If all these beings are immortal, but they can get killed. What is getting killed and what is immortal? So Bhagavan now defines the relationship between the perishable and imperishable.\n\nThe Imperishable is the one which is the essence of any being. Any being is called a being as long as the consciousness is functioning through him. I am who I am as long as I'm alive. Is nothing but a dead body. The dead body is not Nil Bhatt. But he said that which you call your relative Bhishma and Drona.\n\nThat essence is Avinashi. It cannot be destroyed. Tadvidi, know that the essence of a being with whom you have a relationship with is indestructible. It is not limited to that person. This is a complete paradigm shift for most of us who have never thought about it. I have always thought that my self is residing in me and your self is residing in you and herself is residing in her.\n\nThey're all kind of nice little packages of selves, you know. And we are interacting with each other. That which makes your friend your friend is actually indestructible. Your cousin, your cousin is indestructible. Your teacher, teacher indestructible. But that essence is not limited to him.\n\nEverything is pervaded by that essence which you call yourself, which you call your friend's self, which you call grandfather's self. Anything that you can think of, anything they can perceive. Your world perception may be as grand as the entire universe.

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 2, Sankhya Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge. And as we have seen, this is a self unfoldment for the one who has not understood himself. Arjuna has not realized the reality of his own self. Therefore all this confusion. So rather than just giving him a temporary advice of what is right at this time, help to dispel his myth about the nature of the self and give him the right knowledge. So the verse 11 onwards, we had been discussing the nature of this self.\n\nAnd the first thing we have heard from Bhagavan is that the self which you and I considered mortal is actually immortal. That the first declaration very bold. We don't find it very bold because we grew up with it. It was somewhat embedded in our psyche. However, if you imagine your own experiences of your life and your own viewpoint towards life, it's extremely revealing. It is completely different than all my experiences so far.\n\nAll my life I consider this life to be mortal. Therefore there's fear of death. And now Bhagavan says this life is immortal. Your self which considers you as you. That which makes me feel I. That feeling I, which is not related to this body, not this mind, not this intellect.\n\nTherefore I always say my body, my mind, my intellect, that entity he calls this mind is, Bhagavan says eternal is imperishable. That the first declaration, second as we have seen, is then explanation of then what is this mortal life is all about? How does it relate to that immortality? He said that immortal self keep taking different state of existence as embodied one. And just as within this body there are changes occurring, when this body becomes not useful for that embodied one, he moves on to find another body. That change is no different than my growing from baby to young man to an old man and then dying.\n\nSo the idea or the concept of reincarnation is introduced right away in the second verse of that discourse. Now this is something, we do find it very controversial. And Swamiji used to say that one thing good about my profession is I can bluff all my life and never have to Prove anything and nobody can catch me. That's because this is nothing I can prove objectively in the subjective science. Subjectively it can be proved. All our sages and all the prophets of the world have time and again confirmed the nature of this self.\n\nBut it cannot be transferred that knowledge to you in an objective manner. Therefore it is called self unfoldment. Therefore it can only be prescribed how to feel it, how to experience it. If I had been to Hawaii and I can give you all kind of explanation, I can write all kind of essays. But the only way will experience it when you yourself go to Hawaii. So therefore this knowledge can only be experienced.\n\nSo the concept of reincarnation again can only be inferred by our experiences and not can be experienced or proven objectively. And as we had discussed that all of us do come in this world with very different backgrounds and situations and circumstances. And if Bhagavan was all compassionate and equal to all of us, he probably would have created a standard situation for all of us to come in. Same set of parents, same situation. Everybody is given the same amount of money, the first dance and now go do whatever you need to do. But that does not happen.\n\nThat does mean that we may have been carrying some baggage from before we started this journey. I may be carrying some abilities before I started this journey. So it neatly ties the observations in this world which we have of different people having different abilities right from the birth, different tendencies that it must have different experiences prior to this existence as this being. So the explanation of why we see the diversity of situations for all newly born in this world is somewhat explained by this concept of reincarnation. The third is why do I then feel this sorrow and happiness in this world? If my self is immortal, why I'm not experiencing it?\n\nAnd it explained that Matraha Sparsadhu Kantaya that the senses, when it comes in contact with the sense object, depending on the sensitivity of the senses, that I feel either pain or pleasure. And all these experiences, no matter the painful experiences or pleasurable experiences, are time bound, finite. And therefore you bear them or enjoy them, but know that they are going to be possible. So explains our situation how to deal with this life. And then we have come to the conclusion or Bhagavan came to the conclusion. Naasato vidya te Bhavah.\n\nThat which is unreal has no existence. It may be the figment of my imagination. In my perception there is an existence a snake which I am seeing in a rope. In a classical example, snake does have real existence for the one who is seeing the snake. But in reality the snake has no existence. Because it is asat before my delusion and after my delusion is over.\n\nThat snake has no existence. Therefore it is asat that is impermanent. No real existence, but a perceived existence that has no real existence. There is no being for the unreal to come into existence. And for the real there is no non existence. The real, which is myself, has no question of non existence.\n\nTherefore I say, there was never a time when this king were not there or you were not there. That I in I and you in you and he in him and see in her always existed will exist. Bhagavan said in a different form. A gold continues to exist. The form continues to change. The form of a gold bar is temporary.\n\nAt the whim of the owner or the whim of the artist, the goldsmith, that will change and that is impermanent and. And therefore it does not have a real existence. What is real is the gold existence. So we learned that that which is real never cease to exist. That which is unreal truly have no existence other than in my perception. This room space truly has no existence other than its own conditioning.\n\nThere is nothing called room space really exist here other than the space exists here. But I create room space in my perception because of the walls, floor and ceiling. The mortality is for this walls, floor and ceiling. I can remove them anytime I want as an owner. Or somebody may decide to destroy it for other reason. But that can never change the nature of the space within this space was here, is here and will be here.\n\nSo for the space's perspective, there is no mortality from the conditioning perspective. It never really had any real existence other than a relative reality. So therefore, Bhagavan says, avinasi tu tadviddhi iena sarvam idam tatam by which this entire Jagat is pervaded. There is existence everywhere. I exist, you exist, she exists, he exists, chair exists, tree exists. So everything where we see, we consider it in existence.\n\nThat existence in its purity is all pervading. Everywhere I see there is some existence of something that all pervading existence. Bhagavan says Avinashi is indestructible. A form of an existence can be destroyed. Existence itself cannot be destroyed. A table can be destroyed, but the material of the table will remain in some form.\n\nCraig is trying to make a table out of now. The table does not exist right now other than his imagination. But the wood does exist because he said, I have this. I Will buy this and do that that would exist. Table only exist in his imagination. But with his imagination he can bring the form into existence.\n\nAnd it will exist as long as its time is. And then somebody will say, this is not good enough and it will be destroyed. So the form has the mortality, not the existence itself. Know that the all pervading self which makes all the existence possible is indestructible. That also does not exclude you and I. You and I are part of this ever existing, all pervading being.\n\nAnd we have in detail, seen in self unfoldment and thought about. This body is nothing but the food modified. It was something else. It became food for me, it became my body. It will become food for some other entities, creatures, worms, whatever, or fertilizer. Because Hindus get cremated.\n\nSo it will be fertilized. Vinasam avya yasyasya nakastyan kartum arhati. There is none who is capable of destroying this imperishable self. No matter how much force I can apply to this building. I can have bulldozers, I can destroy this building, but cannot destroy the space. Space was here, is and will be here.\n\nNone has any capability to destroy this space. Because this space is all pervading, ever pervading. No one has any capability to destroy the space. The self in me, Bhagavan said, is similarly imperishable. And therefore no one has the capability to destroy that. So if you consider I can destroy somebody's self, you are mistaken.\n\nOr somebody thinks they can destroy myself, they are mistaken. Therefore, Gandhiji said, you probably can destroy my body, but you will never be able to win over my soul. Somebody can kill you, but you cannot kill the self in you, the ideals in you. The message which you leave behind. Nityasya uktaha sharirnaha. So what is destructible?\n\nThese bodies of this embodied one is destructible as an end. This conditioning of this unconditioned space is destructible. Space which is all pervading, ever existing, remaining as is. But it has taken up this conditioning, this conditioning which I see as room space is destructible. And it has its own end. It is own beginning and own end.\n\nTherefore, there is a little plaque in every office building or new commercial building. Say create and such, such and such occupancy, such and such. It says when it was created it does not have a death date. But we know for sure that this building will not be here 500 years from now mortgage companies have figured out the life of your building, typically 30 years. Therefore they give you 30 year mortgage. Because average life of a building in this country we consider 30 years.\n\nSo by the time you depreciate the building at the end of 30 years, the value is zero. Now I have to reconstruct what we call it is a adaptive reuse. And we spent as much money, not as much, probably more money than it took them to build that building and just completely change it into something new warehouse before. Now I'm creating office building into it. But it will never exist in the same fashion forever. It continues to change.\n\nFor that imperishable one's bodies has end. This conditioning of the room we have said is room, walls, floor and ceiling. In my case it is my body, mind and intellect. They have end but not the self. Those are the conditioning taken upon by the imperishable self. Anasi Nah or pramayashya.\n\nBut that entity which you consider yourself, I consider myself. And he, she herself is Anashinaha indestructible, a prameyashya also incomprehensible. That's the problem we have. We just cannot comprehend the self without its conditioning. Imagining a space without conditioning is impossible. No architect can imagine or no designer can imagine a space.\n\nSo for me to consider a space, I have to create conditioning in my mind. Therefore I can imagine space if I have to even conceive the space outside. Only way I conceive the space outside is in reference to the building across the parking lot, the trees across that sky and the moonkanish.",
      "reflection": "Take a few moments today to consider: What would change if you truly believed that your essential Self cannot be harmed? Not as a comforting platitude, but as a lived reality?\n\nWhen fear arises today, experiment with asking: 'What is it that's aware of this fear?' That awareness itself is untouched by what it witnesses. This is the key insight of these verses.\n\nNotice the experiences of pleasure and pain that come to you today. Can you see them as contacts between your senses and sense objects—temporary, impermanent, coming and going like waves? Bear them with equanimity, knowing they will pass."

      "commentary": "Chapter 2 Sankhya Yoga Yoga of Knowledge so as we have discussed before, these 20 verses 11 through 30, describing the nature of the self as described in Upanishads. So I call Bhagavad Gita a clipnotes for Upanishads or Readers Digest, a version of Upanishads. Upanishads are very abstract to understand. So Bhagavad Gita is putting this knowledge in an understandable manner for us. Something which cannot be explained, inexplicable, the nature of the true self. Bhagavan is making an effort for us to understand.\n\nSo so far we have understood from Bhagavan that the self is imperishable, immutable and immortal. And it is all pervading. So myself and yourself are not two different selves. The same self expressing through different bodies, different instruments. Just like Swamiji uses the classic analogy of electricity. Electricity is one, its manifestations are many.\n\nSo in this building right now we see electricity, light, also see the heat from our heater. Both are only expressed in the same energy which is electricity. So you and I are different people, but we are the manifestation of the same entity which I call myself and you call yourself. So we had been discussing this verses where Bhagavan gave us several analogies for us to understand. And one of them says, just as in this body we grow from baby state of child to young adult to adult, and then to an old man. When this self will change this body, it will still be the same change.\n\nIt is no different than the change which you encountered effortlessly. I grew effortlessly from and young adult to an adult into an old man. And to make us understand, we have seen Vaasansi Jirinani ya tha Vihaan. So why do I change this body? He said, because this body is no longer appropriate to fulfill my Vasanathan desires. If my goal is to go from here to D.C. but if my car is not good enough, I have to buy another car or change another car, borrow, rent another car, which is more appropriate for that.\n\nSo because now this body is getting old and non functional that I change the body. Bhagavan has explained the concept of transmigration. Why person goes from one body to another which we have seen in the last verse which is vasansi ji yathavi haya navani gruhanati naroparani tatha sari raani vihaaya jirinani annyani sanyati navani dhi. It is as simple as that. Because this body is old. Just as when the old clothes are no longer useful, I buy new clothes, I change into new clothes.\n\nWhen this body is no longer useful or not appropriate, I move on to the next one. Then coming back to explaining the nature of the self. Next two verses the describe in a manner which we understand. So Swamiji explains here that something which is inexplicable can only be explained in the manner which is explainable. So there is a word in Sanskrit which we almost call Upadesha. Upadesha literally means near place.\n\nPlace which is near to. What I am trying to indicate is Upadesha. Because I cannot transmit my knowledge into your mind or intellect. But I can point out and then you will understand yourself to make it your own knowledge. So if I had been to Hawaii and you have never been to Hawaii and I have to explain to you what Hawaii feels like or looks like, all I can explain to you is the place which you have been to. So we can say, have you not been to Hawaii?\n\nHave you been to Bahamas? I have been to Bahamas. It is something like Bahamas. So I can only explain things which you have not experienced in the parameter of what you know. So Bhagavan here now explain the nature of the self with something which we understand. So it says Na enam chindanti sastrani nayanam dhati pavakaha nacha enam klediyanti apah na shoshayeti maruta.\n\nEverything in this world I see is destructible. There is nothing that I know which does not get destructed. The destruction is the nature of this world. But the destruction can occur in various ways depending on the nature of that thing or being. So things which are grosser can be destroyed by grosser instruments. Nayanam chindanti sastrani Sastrani Weapons or any kind of instrument which can cut axe or a sword which can cut something.\n\nBut sword can only cut something which is as gross or more grosser than the sword. It cannot cut something which is subtler than the sword. So sword can cut object which is Solid, it cannot cut water which is liquid. Because water is subtler than sword itself. Therefore sword cannot cut it. So the implication is the self is subtler than any solid material you see in this world.\n\nTherefore it cannot be cut by weapons. Nayanam Chandanti Sastrani na enam Dahati Pavakaha Fire cannot burn it. Fire can burn everything, but it cannot burn space. Space is subtler than fire and therefore fire cannot burn space. So in the world of manifestation Prakriti we see the five great elements. The earth the grossest and space is the subtlest of all.\n\nSo as the things get subtler, the grosser material cannot affect it. Nayanam Dhati Pavakah so the fire can burn everything, but not something which is subtler than fire. Therefore the self must be subtler than fire. Na chanam kle dian ti apah Water cannot wet it. Water can only wet if something which has space in its structure, interstitial space. A cotton can get soaked because between cotton fiber there is space in between, if there is no space, the water cannot wet it.\n\nSteel, it cannot soak that. So it is even subtler than water and wind cannot dry it. The dehydration only occurs if there is a moisture available in that object. Our body can get dehydrated because we know it is what 80% water. If there is no water in it, it cannot be dried. Water is only there if there is an interstitial space in between the structure.\n\nTo have water in something which is subtler than the instrument of destruction that the instrument cannot destroy. So all the things which we know in this world are basically destructible because they're grosser. Including my mind and intellect. This body get destroyed because it is gross body. It is made up of five elements. So all elements go back to where they come from.\n\nWherever you have borrowed, we borrow a book from library. At some point he will go and return the book. It does not belong to me. I just borrowed it from the library. Same with elements which make my body, mind and intellect are borrowed from Prakriti. Therefore I have to return them when I'm done with it.\n\nThe next verse defines this self a Chedya. So now we have understood that because it cannot be cut, it must be non cuttable. It cannot be burnt, It's non wettable, it is non dryable. And therefore because it cannot be destroyed by any means that we have known. The conclusion is Nityaha permanent. Something which has no destruction has to be permanent.\n\nIf something Is permanent, indestructible. That means he is subtlest of all means of destruction. And if it is subtler than any means of destruction that I know, it has to be all pervading. Therefore it is sarvagataha, all pervading. All pervading literally means it is subtler than anything I can comprehend through my senses. Everything which I can comprehend is finite.\n\nEverything that is finite has its own self, life. But something which is permanent has to be beyond my sense perception. And therefore it is all pervad. If it's all pervading, it has to be firm because there is no place to move. If I am all pervading in my chair, then I cannot move. But if I am sitting on a bench and I am the only one, I can move around on that bench.\n\nTana also can be movable. A tree is stable at the base, but it's moving at the top. Many people do not know the high rise buildings. They also move in the wind. When I first started designing high rise buildings, I come to realize that the movement can be as much as several feet. Buildings which are hundred and something stories, so people get seasickness.\n\nSome people are very sensitive to movement. Most of us do not recognize this thing, but we were sensitive to movement. They feel seasickness because the building literally moves in wind. So when we design it, we have to make sure all parts are basically movable. So all the windows and all that which you see. But from my perspective, the building is stable because my perception doesn't go as far.\n\nThe building is stable at the base with moving at the top. Therefore, the next verse, achalah it not only stable, but unmovable simply because there is no place for it to move. If I'm all pervading, there is no other thing that can exist. So right now, only thing which I can think of, all space, is all pervading. Out of the five great elements I see, the other four are relatively finite. Matter has its own limitations.\n\nThe fire has its own limitations. Air has its own limitations. Water has own limitations. Space is all pervading. From my perspective right now, wherever I think there is space, therefore I can move the parts of this building. Now, these days, with the historical preservation, they sometimes insist that you cannot destroy this building.\n\nBut then some developer wants to buy that land because of great value. Then they will come in and say, we will take this building and put it somewhere else. We can take the whole building from the foundation up, put it in another county, another country. Even so, space does not move. When the building moves, space does not move. I can move my car from one place to another, but the space within the car does not move simply because space is unmovable.\n\nIf space is everywhere, there is no place to go. But everything else moves in the space where space is the subtlest of all the elements of Prakriti. The self is even subtler than the space, all five elements. Therefore it has no place to go. Therefore it is achalam, Sanatanah, eternal or ancient. Sanatana means it's not something new, it not something new that we have invented.\n\nTherefore, if it is something new, new concept that we have figured out, then there will be another time when somebody will make it not valid. New research will occur and say so for a while they say coffee drinking is not good. Then they came back and said, no, coffee is actually good for you. If you drink at least X number of cups of coffee, then you don't get Alzheimer or at least your brain will function well. That was a great solace to me. Okay, okay, I'm with.\n\nSo it keeps changing. If there's something new, it has all probability of getting invalid. But he says it's a Sanata. It's ancient, it's eternal. Before the time that you can think of, anything you can think of in past, it is beyond that. Therefore it's sanatanah.\n\nIt is unmanifest, a chinti. It cannot be thought of. It cannot be thought by my thinking instrument. So everything I try to understand, everything I comprehend in this world is actually by my intellect to understand it. When it comes in my comprehension, it has limitations. Everything I can comprehend is finite.\n\nI can think of elephant, I can think of buildings. All that I can think is finite because they are manifest. The self is unmanifest. Manifest is something I can perceive through my senses.",

The earth the grossest and space is the subtlest of all.\n\nSo as the things get subtler, the grosser material cannot affect it. Nayanam Dhati Pavakah so the fire can burn everything, but not something which is subtler than fire. Therefore the self must be subtler than fire. Na chanam kle dian ti apah Water cannot wet it. Water can only wet if something which has space in its structure, interstitial space. A cotton can get soaked because between cotton fiber there is space in between, if there is no space, the water cannot wet it.\n\nSteel, it cannot soak that. So it is even subtler than water and wind cannot dry it. The dehydration only occurs if there is a moisture available in that object. Our body can get dehydrated because we know it is what 80% water. If there is no water in it, it cannot be dried. Water is only there if there is an interstitial space in between the structure.\n\nTo have water in something which is subtler than the instrument of destruction that the instrument cannot destroy. So all the things which we know in this world are basically destructible because they're grosser. Including my mind and intellect. This body get destroyed because it is gross body. It is made up of five elements. So all elements go back to where they come from.\n\nWherever you have borrowed, we borrow a book from library. At some point he will go and return the book. It does not belong to me. I just borrowed it from the library. Same with elements which make my body, mind and intellect are borrowed from Prakriti. Therefore I have to return them when I'm done with it.\n\nThe next verse defines this self a Chedya. So now we have understood that because it cannot be cut, it must be non cuttable. It cannot be burnt, It's non wettable, it is non dryable. And therefore because it cannot be destroyed by any means that we have known. The conclusion is Nityaha permanent. Something which has no destruction has to be permanent.\n\nIf something Is permanent, indestructible. That means he is subtlest of all means of destruction. And if it is subtler than any means of destruction that I know, it has to be all pervading. Therefore it is sarvagataha, all pervading. All pervading literally means it is subtler than anything I can comprehend through my senses. Everything which I can comprehend is finite.\n\nEverything that is finite has its own self, life. But something which is permanent has to be beyond my sense perception. And therefore it is all pervad. If it's all pervading, it has to be firm because there is no place to move. If I am all pervading in my chair, then I cannot move. But if I am sitting on a bench and I am the only one, I can move around on that bench.\n\nTana also can be movable. A tree is stable at the base, but it's moving at the top. Many people do not know the high rise buildings. They also move in the wind. When I first started designing high rise buildings, I come to realize that the movement can be as much as several feet. Buildings which are hundred and something stories, so people get seasickness.\n\nSome people are very sensitive to movement. Most of us do not recognize this thing, but we were sensitive to movement. They feel seasickness because the building literally moves in wind. So when we design it, we have to make sure all parts are basically movable. So all the windows and all that which you see. But from my perspective, the building is stable because my perception doesn't go as far.\n\nThe building is stable at the base with moving at the top. Therefore, the next verse, achalah it not only stable, but unmovable simply because there is no place for it to move. If I'm all pervading, there is no other thing that can exist. So right now, only thing which I can think of, all space, is all pervading. Out of the five great elements I see, the other four are relatively finite. Matter has its own limitations.\n\nThe fire has its own limitations. Air has its own limitations. Water has own limitations. Space is all pervading. From my perspective right now, wherever I think there is space, therefore I can move the parts of this building. Now, these days, with the historical preservation, they sometimes insist that you cannot destroy this building.\n\nBut then some developer wants to buy that land because of great value. Then they will come in and say, we will take this building and put it somewhere else. We can take the whole building from the foundation up, put it in another county, another country. Even so, space does not move. When the building moves, space does not move. I can move my car from one place to another, but the space within the car does not move simply because space is unmovable.\n\nIf space is everywhere, there is no place to go. But everything else moves in the space where space is the subtlest of all the elements of Prakriti. The self is even subtler than the space, all five elements. Therefore it has no place to go. Therefore it is achalam, Sanatanah, eternal or ancient. Sanatana means it's not something new, it not something new that we have invented.\n\nTherefore, if it is something new, new concept that we have figured out, then there will be another time when somebody will make it not valid. New research will occur and say so for a while they say coffee drinking is not good. Then they came back and said, no, coffee is actually good for you. If you drink at least X number of cups of coffee, then you don't get Alzheimer or at least your brain will function well. That was a great solace to me. Okay, okay, I'm with.\n\nSo it keeps changing. If there's something new, it has all probability of getting invalid. But he says it's a Sanata. It's ancient, it's eternal. Before the time that you can think of, anything you can think of in past, it is beyond that. Therefore it's sanatanah.\n\nIt is unmanifest, a chinti. It cannot be thought of. It cannot be thought by my thinking instrument. So everything I try to understand, everything I comprehend in this world is actually by my intellect to understand it. When it comes in my comprehension, it has limitations. Everything I can comprehend is finite.\n\nI can think of elephant, I can think of buildings. All that I can think is finite because they are manifest. The self is unmanifest. Manifest is something I can perceive through my senses.",
      "reflection": "Take a few moments today to consider: What would change if you truly believed that your essential Self cannot be harmed? Not as a comforting platitude, but as a lived reality?\n\nWhen fear arises today, experiment with asking: 'What is it that's aware of this fear?' That awareness itself is untouched by what it witnesses. This is the key insight of these verses.\n\nNotice the experiences of pleasure and pain that come to you today. Can you see them as contacts between your senses and sense objects—temporary, impermanent, coming and going like waves? Bear them with equanimity, knowing they will pass."

      "commentary": "We have completed discussion on Chapter 1, Arjuna Vishadha Yoga, in which we have seen our conditions in this world. Arjuna Vishada Yoga represents our life where we are trained all our life for something. We have certain ideals and certain duties which we have held very dear to us. This is the very goal of my life. But then sometimes the situation overwhelms us, which makes us confused about what is right and what is wrong. And at that point our mind starts giving us wrong indications of what is right and what is wrong.\n\nAnd we come up with all kinds of arguments about why I shouldn't be doing my duty, why I shouldn't be doing what I thought all this time that this is right for me. And this argument sometimes are so convincing that we convince ourselves. And saying that is the voice of my antaratma. However, it is just a blabbering of my mind because I have not really established myself into my own self. So this is not the advice from the Krishna. The consciousness in me, but my mind coming up with very defensive mechanism is why I shouldn't be doing this just because I'm overwhelmed by the situation.\n\nSo we have seen in the last few verses of chapter one, Arjuna put forth a very brilliant argument about why he shouldn't be fighting this war. First he says from my personal point of view, I shouldn't be fighting this war. To kill my own Keith and Cain looks very logical. Why should you be killing your Keith and Cain? When that argument didn't seem like convincing Krishna because he didn't have an approving reaction, he realized because those Kith and Cain are standing right in front of you to kill you. So that didn't seem like a very logical argument, he goes to the next level and says the war itself is very evil.\n\nAny war is evil because in war the man will die, many men will die, which is obvious. In any war the man will die and therefore it will upset the entire society, entire the equilibrium of the society by destroying the family units. When a man dies in the family, obviously the family loses the head of the household. Now the women will be unprotected. And when the women becomes unprotected, they obviously will do something which is not according to their dharma, because they have no protection. And when that happens, the whole system will be out of kilter because they may do things which is out of line, where they'll give a rise to you want to Sankar the next generation.\n\nAnd that will completely upset our system, where the lineage of a father to the son in the same tradition will be giving oblation to the Pitrus. So the whole system will be completely destroyed according to Arjuna. Again, this makes a lot of sense, that war is evil. Everyone knows war is not something which is to look forward to, but war is inevitable sometimes to protect the society, protect the dharma. So here Arjuna makes all the arguments which he thinks he can make against fighting this war. And then he sits down in his chariot.\n\nIn the last verse, which we have seen, Sanjay described that after making his argument, he didn't see any reaction for Krishna, but he drops down and throws the weapons away. That means he does not even have a mental capacity to hang on to himself. So the next chapter which we are entering into, called Sankhya Yoga, the Yoga of Knowledge. Yoga of Knowledge, in the line of the knowledge of the Sankhyas, and as Swamiji describes in the commentary that we have in our system, there are six schools of thoughts, there are six different lines of philosophy where each one takes a very slightly different route from each other. And Sankhya is one of them. The Sankhya is supposed to be the most logical thought, almost more as scientific as the modern sciences.\n\nIt's a very logical approach to what is reality, what is truth, what is my essence, and what is the ultimate reality. It takes a very logical approach, and as we have seen in Logic of Spirituality, it takes you through who am I and what is my self. Then where did I come from? Where we have seen anything which we see is an effect of a cause. When I see a book here, it's an effect. The cause is somebody who knew how to write the book, how to print the book, and how to put it together.\n\nThe book is in front of me. So there are causes to cause any reality. I exist, I'm an effect. There are causes which cause me to be in this effect. Those causes are broadly defined as an efficient cause and a material cause. Someone who knew how to create me in this effect.\n\nAnd someone also had the material to create me. Someone who knew how to create this book and someone also the material to create this book. So the knowledge is called efficient cause and the material is called material cause. These two has to come together for any effect to come into existence. And we can trace back all of that. And who had this efficient cause and material cause, both of them, to create this universe and me.\n\nAnd we trace it back to one entity who had the knowledge to create this universe. So I become part of it and also had the material to create that universe. So the efficient cause we call God, God has the knowledge to create this universe, including my own self. He also had the material to create this universe and myself. Then where did that material come from? And in the end of our inquiry we come to the conclusion the material could not have come from anywhere else but from his own self, because there was nothing else existed before this universe was created but that one singularity which we call God, and that God had the knowledge.\n\nThe only material available to him was his own self. So out of his own self is created this universe. So my own self also cannot have come other than from his own self. So myself and his self is one and the same. My self is nothing but the reflection of his self. Thus logically concluding that Myself cannot be separate from his self because his self is immortal, imperishable, Myself also cannot be perishable or mortal.\n\nThat is the philosophy of Sankhya or the Sankhya philosophy. Now obviously the Sankhya philosophy here is not verbatim put together, but in its flavor in essence was taken here by Bhagavan Vedvyas, also called Badarayana in the Uttar Mimsa school of thought, which is Thai Stick Thaism, as Swamiji says, which accept the reality of the one eternal self called Brahman, and also accept the reality of this world and its relationship. Thus we will be seeing in Bhagavad Gita in chapter two onward, the synthesis of all the three paths of realization explained in Vedas, which is the Bhakti Yoga, Karma Yoga and Gnana Yoga. Bhagavad Gita puts all these three yogas together as a comprehensive path of realization. It's a pravruti vaad that you have to actively engage in this world, then achieve the ultimate happiness which you're seeking with the freedom from all these bondages of limitations which I superimposed on myself. So in second chapter we'll be learning that the second chapter happens with the Sanjaya's assessment of what's happening there.\n\nChapter 2, verse 1 says Sanjaya Vacha tam tatha krupaya vistam asrupurna kulekshanam Vishidantam Idam Vakyam Uvacha Madhusudhana, Madhusudana Krishna. And we have seen the Madhusudana one who is the slayer of the demon Madhu. Obviously in the Puranic story all these demons who Krishna has slayed but also kind of philosophically you say demon Madhu is that which seems very sweet to me in life, but it is not good for me. That which is Prayas but not Shreyas, that which seems good for me but is not good for me. Madhu Sudhana is the slayer of that. When my intellectual is awakened to that, I realize this may seem good to me, but not good to me.\n\nSo that Madhusud and Lord Krishna said this to the one who was completely overwhelmed by this pity and despondency, that is, he's overwhelmed by this grief, with his eyes full of tears, agitated Bhagavan said this first reaction of what Arjuna presented his case of why he shouldn't be fighting. He was obviously expecting that. Well, let's not fight this war. But the reaction came in next two verses is completely shocking to Arjuna. The Sri Bhagavanovaja the second verse first time Bhagavan speaks in this Gita Kutatva Kasmalam Idam Vishame Samupasthitam Anariya Jistam Aswargyam aa kirtikaram Arjuna. O Arjuna, where does this weakness of heart comes upon you?\n\nWhich is Anari Jistham only practiced by those who are not civilized like you. Because Arya is the civilized one, Anaria is the uncivilized one according to their social order. One who is not civilized, who does not know the value of dharma, value of performing his own duties. Once a duty is assigned to me, I have assigned myself as taking upon that role, then it becomes imperative that I perform that duty. Once I decide that I want to be a husband, all the duties of husbands are now superimposed on my and as long as I want to be a husband, I have to perform all those duties that the civilized man's law. Once I decide I want to be a father, all the fatherly duties are assigned to me and there is no escape for me to perform those duties.\n\nThat's a civilized way of living. So once I have decided I'm going to be the general of this army, the leader of this society, then all the duties assigned to me as the leader of this army and leader of this society, I have to perform those duties. Now when I'm trying to shirk away from those duties. That is Anaria jistham. Only those who are not civilized will do that. They will be those deadbeat dads.\n\nThey are not civilized. They do not know that their duty is to pay whatever the alimony for their children. So only the uncivilized one will do that. So Bhagavan said, where does this Anaria jistham, weakness of your heart, which is not allowing you to do your duty, come upon you, which is a kirtikaram? It's not going to give you a good name. You may have all the good arguments to not do your duties, but once you don't do your duties, it's not going to give you a good name, not going to make you famous.\n\nThat how he ran away from his duties, you know, and this is because of the weakness of your heart. When you were thinking correctly, you knew what your duty is because you are the leader of this army and you knew what to do is to fight the enemy which is standing in front of you. You have not asked for this war. You didn't decide that this is the right thing to do. But the others in in their evil thoughts have decided to fight this war. Now it is your duty to lead your army into this war.\n\nSo this is not something Krishna says, I approve to running away from your duty. And therefore here is what I prescribe to you. So next verse he says this is what you should be doing. Get up O Paranthapa, which is another Arjuna name, A scorcher of the foes, reminding him that your enemies will be afraid of you. Your training and your achievement in life is your enemies can stand in front of you.",
      "reflection": "Take a few moments today to consider: What would change if you truly believed that your essential Self cannot be harmed? Not as a comforting platitude, but as a lived reality?\n\nWhen fear arises today, experiment with asking: 'What is it that's aware of this fear?' That awareness itself is untouched by what it witnesses. This is the key insight of these verses.\n\nNotice the experiences of pleasure and pain that come to you today. Can you see them as contacts between your senses and sense objects—temporary, impermanent, coming and going like waves? Bear them with equanimity, knowing they will pass."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 2, Sankhya Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge. So far we have seen in the chapter that Bhagavan explained to Arjuna his situation from various perspectives, not just one perspective, that this is my idea, you should do this. But he gave him various perspectives. The first perspective, spiritual perspective, from the highest perspective, from the spirit's point of view that the self is immutable, imperishable. So that's the highest perspective. Then it came down to the society's perspective.\n\nAnd see, from a society's perspective, you as a Kshatriya has duty to protect the society from evil. If you see that evil is occurring in the society, we rely on the Kshatriya just like we rely on our armies to protect ourselves. Our army cannot become pacifist at the last minute. From that perspective, this is the best opportunity you have to perform your art and perform your duty. So society's perspective, he gave his opinion that this is still what you should be looking at. Then came down the individual's perspective.\n\nThere we have seen Bhagavan said, if you give up, you run away from your duty, then you will incur sin. He has looked at the issue from various perspectives and came to the same conclusion that Arjuna should fight this war. So in the process, Bhagavan also taught us the art of persuasion. If to persuade somebody who is bent upon doing something other than what we think is right for him, just giving me your opinion that look, you are doing something wrong, but it's not going to work. The only way that works is when you give him a three dimensional view of his situation, give him the view from various perspectives, look at it from various points of view and then the person will be able to see it correctly, then you will be able to persuade him. This can be also applicable to looking at any problem, any situation.\n\nYou come across a situation where you got a job in another town, that's best for you. From your professional perspective, well that's great. But if you take the decision just based on that, it may or may not be right. So you have to look at it from various perspectives. First you say, well from a professional perspective it seems like that job will give me more opportunity to go further in my career. Then you see it from family's perspective.\n\nWill my family be comfortable relocating from this town to another? Will they be able to adjust as easily as they are adjusted here? Then lastly, you also have to see what the school district is in that new town. Is it as good or better in that town? And if you come to the same conclusion from all three of them, then relocation is the great idea. Take the job and move or you will find that you will end up commuting just like most of our friends do who work outside Richmond in Washington or or other places.\n\nSo any problem or situation cannot be viewed from just one perspective. And you can come to right decision or you can convince someone. So this art of persuasion is to give somebody a three dimensional view of a situation and then come to the conclusion. In this case, Bhagavan came to the same conclusion from all perspectives. From a spiritual, from a society's perspective, from individual Arjuna must fight this war. What typically works best is when it comes to me, I can see from my perspective that it is right.\n\nSo therefore Bhagavan put more stress on his individual situation. So we have seen that he's saying tathaha swadharma kirtim hitva papa vapsyasi. If you give up your duties, you will incur Papa. And this obviously is very dreaded word in Hindu society that you will incur papa. So that obviously worked probably more effectively. But you had the background of other two perspectives that this is right, this is the right thing to do from all perspectives.\n\nSo Bhagavan pursue that point of view a little further and says, bhayat ranat uparatam mansante tvam maharathaha isam chatvam bahumatah bhatva yasyasi lagavam. So all these great warriors who are gathered here on our side and on the other side, they have very high regards for you. Because of your valor and your prowess. They are unwillingly accepting your enemy, unwillingly accepting that you are one of the best warriors. It is not easy to confront you. You are the one who has achieved the pasupatastra from Lord Shiva himself.\n\nObviously there's a story that Arjunaya goes for tapas to please Lord Shiva. And in the end he ended up fighting with Lord Shiva himself. But Lord Shiva was so pleased that he revealed himself that I am not just the hunter which you are fighting, but I am Lord Shiva. Here is the Pashupadashtra. And as the Purana says, the Pasupatastra is like ultimate weapon. It can destroy the entire universe in no time.\n\nSo you are the one who has such a prowess that you can destroy everybody in no time if you really choose to. However, you cannot use any weapon irresponsibly. Just like our nuclear weapons. You may have capability but you may never use it. He said those people, they will then think that you ran away from this war because of fear. Even though that may not be reality but that's how you will be viewed by your peers and your enemies.\n\nThey will belittle you, they have high respect for you. And they will say I don't know what we were thinking. This guy turned out to be not really what we thought he is going to be. It's not something very comfortable for you if that happens. So the next verse says. Not only that you will disappoint your friends and relatives and people who are relying on you, the society.\n\nBut there are ahitha people who are not your well wishers, you know, enemies who wish that you go away. He said they will be telling stories about your cowardice. All kinds of, you know, Bahun, vadish, shanti or vachevadas. Things which we cannot repeat on national tv. That kind of talk, they will be talking about you. So please think about it.\n\nNinantaha, tava, samaratyam. They will be cavilling at your prowess. That I think it was all big hype. It was all made up stories that he is such a great warrior. I don't think he had those qualities. And if that's happened, what is more painful than that?\n\nThat nobody will ever realize that you ran away because you thought that killing your cousins and your teachers is not a right thing to do. But they will think it's a fear of war, fear of defeat which made you go away. So don't think this is going to be easy. If you go away and then in any deal which we make, you have to come up with a win win situation. The only way the deal gets closed, when a client comes to me, he thinks I can provide most appropriate services and I think this is the right project for me then only we sign a contract. If I don't think it is right or he thinks it is right for him, nothing happens.\n\nSo you have to come up with any situation. Win win situation where both parties will have a good outcome. Now in this case, if you are just looking at our own situation. Any decision which I take out of the absence available to me, I should feel comfortable that it will be acceptable situation for me. So Bhagavan now uses that final trump card and says if you die, you will go to the hero's heaven. So there is a special section of heaven which is reserved for these great heroes who die on the battlefield.\n\nIt's like the GI Bill, these great privileges in heaven for the heroes who serve their country, serve the society, in the process they die. You can think about the health care workers who lost their lives in this battle against Corona. So here our scripture says they have a special Saxon in heaven to reward them for their valor and their courage. Hatova Prapsesi Swargam Jitwava Bakshishe Mahim. If you die, you go to the heaven for the heroes. If you win, you will lead the kingdom on this earth.\n\nThis is a no brainer for you. There is no way that you can lose one way or other. Fight and die or fight and win both ways. So there is nothing to think about it. Here the only good decision is fight the war. Therefore he says, Tasmat Utthishtka Yudhaya Krutan Nishayah.\n\nTherefore O son of Kunti, get up with a resolve to fight this war. So this is like a conclusive statement from Bhagavan. In the beginning Arjuna asked him and said, give me which is shreyas for me. And we have come across the word shreyas and prayers before. That which is always good. It may not feel good, but it is good for me.\n\nPrayer says it feels good but not good for me. And Arjuna, no uncertain terms and ask Bhagavan, tell me what is good for me and I will do it. Now Bhagavan says Utthiste Kamanteya, get up with the resolve to fight this war. So that was the conclusive advice from Bhagavan. And then Bhagavan now introduces the concept of Karma Yoga. You have to act in this world and there will be consequences of your actions.\n\nYou are part of this world. This Sansa and this Sansar is not homogeneous experiences. The experiences are varied. Some are conducive, some are not conducive. You will fight the war. Outcome is not guaranteed.\n\nThe experience will not be as you predict. It may be something different. But you have to treat whatever you face with an equal state of mind. You have to treat them alike no matter what the outcome is. Because you are enjoying the ride in this world. The next verse now introduces the idea of how to transform Karma into Karma Yoga.\n\nSame action, changing the mental attitude becomes Karma yoga. It says Sukhdu KE samy krutva alabha jaya jayo Tathaya yujaswa na evam papam avapsyasi. We came back to the papa again. So in verse 33 he said that Tathaha swadharma kirtim chahitva papam awapsyasi. You will incur sin if you abandon your duty. Here he says Tatha yudhaya yujyashwa na evam papam avapshasi.\n\nYou will not incur any sin. But the condition is sukha dukkha samay krutva sukhyana dukkha. You should treat them alike. It's more like an observer. It does not mean that you react to Sukhanidukha in the same way but you treat them alike as an observer. It's like that to me.\n\nOne says I think I should have a cup of coffee. The one who is thinking about me having cup of coffee, that's an observer. See that observer should be neutral. He should be treating anything which comes alike. Sukhar Dukkha at the mental level, my experience. When I experience there will be mental reaction and say this is conducive.\n\nNot conducive, not good. Well, say there is a dukkha at the mental level, profit and loss. Now that obviously at the intellectual level. Am I making profit by doing this or I'm losing something? Here is my intellect. I actually thought I'm gonna get this but I didn't get that.\n\nAnd therefore this is a loss or this is a profit. So that's at the intellectual level. Finally both Jaya and Ajaya victory or defeat is at the physical level. I tried to gain something, I did not gain it. I competed against several firms to get a project. That's a real reality, the physical reality that I don't have that project anymore.",
      "reflection": "Take a few moments today to consider: What would change if you truly believed that your essential Self cannot be harmed? Not as a comforting platitude, but as a lived reality?\n\nWhen fear arises today, experiment with asking: 'What is it that's aware of this fear?' That awareness itself is untouched by what it witnesses. This is the key insight of these verses.\n\nNotice the experiences of pleasure and pain that come to you today. Can you see them as contacts between your senses and sense objects—temporary, impermanent, coming and going like waves? Bear them with equanimity, knowing they will pass."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 2, Sankhya Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge. So far we have seen in the chapter that Bhagavan explained to Arjuna his situation from various perspectives, not just one perspective, that this is my idea, you should do this. But he gave him various perspectives. The first perspective, spiritual perspective, from the highest perspective, from the spirit's point of view that the self is immutable, imperishable. So that's the highest perspective. Then it came down to the society's perspective.\n\nAnd see, from a society's perspective, you as a Kshatriya has duty to protect the society from evil. If you see that evil is occurring in the society, we rely on the Kshatriya just like we rely on our armies to protect ourselves. Our army cannot become pacifist at the last minute. From that perspective, this is the best opportunity you have to perform your art and perform your duty. So society's perspective, he gave his opinion that this is still what you should be looking at. Then came down the individual's perspective.\n\nThere we have seen Bhagavan said, if you give up, you run away from your duty, then you will incur sin. He has looked at the issue from various perspectives and came to the same conclusion that Arjuna should fight this war. So in the process, Bhagavan also taught us the art of persuasion. If to persuade somebody who is bent upon doing something other than what we think is right for him, just giving me your opinion that look, you are doing something wrong, but it's not going to work. The only way that works is when you give him a three dimensional view of his situation, give him the view from various perspectives, look at it from various points of view and then the person will be able to see it correctly, then you will be able to persuade him. This can be also applicable to looking at any problem, any situation.\n\nYou come across a situation where you got a job in another town, that's best for you. From your professional perspective, well that's great. But if you take the decision just based on that, it may or may not be right. So you have to look at it from various perspectives. First you say, well from a professional perspective it seems like that job will give me more opportunity to go further in my career. Then you see it from family's perspective.\n\nWill my family be comfortable relocating from this town to another? Will they be able to adjust as easily as they are adjusted here? Then lastly, you also have to see what the school district is in that new town. Is it as good or better in that town? And if you come to the same conclusion from all three of them, then relocation is the great idea. Take the job and move or you will find that you will end up commuting just like most of our friends do who work outside Richmond in Washington or or other places.\n\nSo any problem or situation cannot be viewed from just one perspective. And you can come to right decision or you can convince someone. So this art of persuasion is to give somebody a three dimensional view of a situation and then come to the conclusion. In this case, Bhagavan came to the same conclusion from all perspectives. From a spiritual, from a society's perspective, from individual Arjuna must fight this war. What typically works best is when it comes to me, I can see from my perspective that it is right.\n\nSo therefore Bhagavan put more stress on his individual situation. So we have seen that he's saying tathaha swadharma kirtim hitva papa vapsyasi. If you give up your duties, you will incur Papa. And this obviously is very dreaded word in Hindu society that you will incur papa. So that obviously worked probably more effectively. But you had the background of other two perspectives that this is right, this is the right thing to do from all perspectives.\n\nSo Bhagavan pursue that point of view a little further and says, bhayat ranat uparatam mansante tvam maharathaha isam chatvam bahumatah bhatva yasyasi lagavam. So all these great warriors who are gathered here on our side and on the other side, they have very high regards for you. Because of your valor and your prowess. They are unwillingly accepting your enemy, unwillingly accepting that you are one of the best warriors. It is not easy to confront you. You are the one who has achieved the pasupatastra from Lord Shiva himself.\n\nObviously there's a story that Arjunaya goes for tapas to please Lord Shiva. And in the end he ended up fighting with Lord Shiva himself. But Lord Shiva was so pleased that he revealed himself that I am not just the hunter which you are fighting, but I am Lord Shiva. Here is the Pashupadashtra. And as the Purana says, the Pasupatastra is like ultimate weapon. It can destroy the entire universe in no time.\n\nSo you are the one who has such a prowess that you can destroy everybody in no time if you really choose to. However, you cannot use any weapon irresponsibly. Just like our nuclear weapons. You may have capability but you may never use it. He said those people, they will then think that you ran away from this war because of fear. Even though that may not be reality but that's how you will be viewed by your peers and your enemies.\n\nThey will belittle you, they have high respect for you. And they will say I don't know what we were thinking. This guy turned out to be not really what we thought he is going to be. It's not something very comfortable for you if that happens. So the next verse says. Not only that you will disappoint your friends and relatives and people who are relying on you, the society.\n\nBut there are ahitha people who are not your well wishers, you know, enemies who wish that you go away. He said they will be telling stories about your cowardice. All kinds of, you know, Bahun, vadish, shanti or vachevadas. Things which we cannot repeat on national tv. That kind of talk, they will be talking about you. So please think about it.\n\nNinantaha, tava, samaratyam. They will be cavilling at your prowess. That I think it was all big hype. It was all made up stories that he is such a great warrior. I don't think he had those qualities. And if that's happened, what is more painful than that?\n\nThat nobody will ever realize that you ran away because you thought that killing your cousins and your teachers is not a right thing to do. But they will think it's a fear of war, fear of defeat which made you go away. So don't think this is going to be easy. If you go away and then in any deal which we make, you have to come up with a win win situation. The only way the deal gets closed, when a client comes to me, he thinks I can provide most appropriate services and I think this is the right project for me then only we sign a contract. If I don't think it is right or he thinks it is right for him, nothing happens.\n\nSo you have to come up with any situation. Win win situation where both parties will have a good outcome. Now in this case, if you are just looking at our own situation. Any decision which I take out of the absence available to me, I should feel comfortable that it will be acceptable situation for me. So Bhagavan now uses that final trump card and says if you die, you will go to the hero's heaven. So there is a special section of heaven which is reserved for these great heroes who die on the battlefield.\n\nIt's like the GI Bill, these great privileges in heaven for the heroes who serve their country, serve the society, in the process they die. You can think about the health care workers who lost their lives in this battle against Corona. So here our scripture says they have a special Saxon in heaven to reward them for their valor and their courage. Hatova Prapsesi Swargam Jitwava Bakshishe Mahim. If you die, you go to the heaven for the heroes. If you win, you will lead the kingdom on this earth.\n\nThis is a no brainer for you. There is no way that you can lose one way or other. Fight and die or fight and win both ways. So there is nothing to think about it. Here the only good decision is fight the war. Therefore he says, Tasmat Utthishtka Yudhaya Krutan Nishayah.\n\nTherefore O son of Kunti, get up with a resolve to fight this war. So this is like a conclusive statement from Bhagavan. In the beginning Arjuna asked him and said, give me which is shreyas for me. And we have come across the word shreyas and prayers before. That which is always good. It may not feel good, but it is good for me.\n\nPrayer says it feels good but not good for me. And Arjuna, no uncertain terms and ask Bhagavan, tell me what is good for me and I will do it. Now Bhagavan says Utthiste Kamanteya, get up with the resolve to fight this war. So that was the conclusive advice from Bhagavan. And then Bhagavan now introduces the concept of Karma Yoga. You have to act in this world and there will be consequences of your actions.\n\nYou are part of this world. This Sansa and this Sansar is not homogeneous experiences. The experiences are varied. Some are conducive, some are not conducive. You will fight the war. Outcome is not guaranteed.\n\nThe experience will not be as you predict. It may be something different. But you have to treat whatever you face with an equal state of mind. You have to treat them alike no matter what the outcome is. Because you are enjoying the ride in this world. The next verse now introduces the idea of how to transform Karma into Karma Yoga.\n\nSame action, changing the mental attitude becomes Karma yoga. It says Sukhdu KE samy krutva alabha jaya jayo Tathaya yujaswa na evam papam avapsyasi. We came back to the papa again. So in verse 33 he said that Tathaha swadharma kirtim chahitva papam awapsyasi. You will incur sin if you abandon your duty. Here he says Tatha yudhaya yujyashwa na evam papam avapshasi.\n\nYou will not incur any sin. But the condition is sukha dukkha samay krutva sukhyana dukkha. You should treat them alike. It's more like an observer. It does not mean that you react to Sukhanidukha in the same way but you treat them alike as an observer. It's like that to me.\n\nOne says I think I should have a cup of coffee. The one who is thinking about me having cup of coffee, that's an observer. See that observer should be neutral. He should be treating anything which comes alike. Sukhar Dukkha at the mental level, my experience. When I experience there will be mental reaction and say this is conducive.\n\nNot conducive, not good. Well, say there is a dukkha at the mental level, profit and loss. Now that obviously at the intellectual level. Am I making profit by doing this or I'm losing something? Here is my intellect. I actually thought I'm gonna get this but I didn't get that.\n\nAnd therefore this is a loss or this is a profit. So that's at the intellectual level. Finally both Jaya and Ajaya victory or defeat is at the physical level. I tried to gain something, I did not gain it. I competed against several firms to get a project. That's a real reality, the physical reality that I don't have that project anymore.",
      "reflection": "Take a few moments today to consider: What would change if you truly believed that your essential Self cannot be harmed? Not as a comforting platitude, but as a lived reality?\n\nWhen fear arises today, experiment with asking: 'What is it that's aware of this fear?' That awareness itself is untouched by what it witnesses. This is the key insight of these verses.\n\nNotice the experiences of pleasure and pain that come to you today. Can you see them as contacts between your senses and sense objects—temporary, impermanent, coming and going like waves? Bear them with equanimity, knowing they will pass."

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing Chapter 2, Sankhya Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge. So far we have discussed up to the verse 30, the knowledge of Sankhya, the knowledge about your own self. What is the nature of the self? And then now I'll teach you the Buddhi Yoga. I'll teach you the Yoga of how to implement this knowledge in your life. Buddhi Yoga, Intelligent way of living.\n\nAnd then Bhagavan said, the way to work in this world is to have equanimity. Equanimity comes from your understanding of what you are getting into. If you understand the field of actions, the nature of the field of actions, the equanimity comes easily, naturally. If you do not understand the field of action, then obviously you will have difficulties. And we have used the example of roller coaster. That one who is standing in the line with all the enthusiasm, he knows what is the nature of the roller coaster.\n\nHe anticipates the ups and downs and twists and turns. That's the thrill of riding a roller coaster. If there was no ups and downs and twists and turns, there is no fun in roller coaster. More twists and turns and more ups and downs, that roller coaster more enjoyable then you go back and stand in line again to join. So if you enter this Sansar with the expectation that there will be ups and downs, twists and turns. Sukhaduka Lava Alabha Jaya Jaya.\n\nWell that's the thrill of living in Sansar. So at the end of this life we'll come to the conclusion that that was pretty thrilling ride. Well, let's do it all over again. That's Kurupunar Janma. We'll stand in line again in that Sansa. While we are on that ride we forget that this is what we signed up for.\n\nThat's where problem comes. So Bhagavan said keep that in mind that these are natural and this is what you signed up for. The goal of life is to realize your true self. Which is what Bhagavan said I taught you in the first portion of this discussion. Now I want to tell you how to use that knowledge to realize that ultimate truth, the self, the nature of yourself. Bhagavan Ved Vyas discusses what is the difficulty we have in understanding our Darshan Shastras.\n\nSo we have basically discussed in the beginning there are six schools of thought and the school of thought which is based on the previous portion of Veda called Karmakanda. So all Vedas are divided into four parts. There are the mantras, then Brahmanas, then Aranyakas, and then Upanishads. The philosophy which is more centered around Karmakand. The Brahmana portion is called Purva Vimansa. We have discussed before, in Purva Mimsa, the goal of life is to reach heavens.\n\nAnd in heavens then you will have supra sensuous experiences to make you feel happy. Every good action we perform will create merits. You accumulate enough merits so you can go to Swarga. And in that Swarga, then you will have these enjoyments. When you exhaust your balance of your merits, you will come back again, work again for the more merits and go back to Swarga again. But that's the goal of life in Purva Mimsa.\n\nAnd therefore the society in general placed more emphasis on collecting merits and various ways to do yajnas and rituals. So the means of rituals was supposed to be to purify your mind and intellect so you can become single pointed. But the means became the goal in the society and they completely missed the boat. So now we see the criticism from Bhagavan Ved Vyas that how we have missed that boat as a society. And we have seen time and again in history of India that these philosophers and the great thinkers have come to realign the religion back to its goal. So this spiritual aspect becomes available to all people.\n\nSo it seems that during Mahabharata time the spiritual aspect of the goal was not available to most people. People were stuck into the rituals. So Bhagawan Vedvyas criticizes those people who had been misguiding the generations. So he says in verse 42 yam imam puspitam vacam. Those people using the flowery language are unwise. The unwise people are using flowery language.\n\nThe language used in Brahmana portion of Bhagavadas. He said, they make it sound like that is the goal. Those description rituals are for you to purify your mind and intellectual. But here they have made it sound like that is the goal. This is what you should be doing. Then it became so elaborate and society was so indulgent into it, that average person was afraid of the word yoga or Yajna.\n\nBecause in each ritual it has been said that if you don't perform it correctly then you will incur sin, it will be adverse effect. So you have to have an expert to tell you how to do it. And each ritual became so elaborate that it is very elaborately describe what type of bricks to be used, how the bricks to be arranged for the yajna. So an average person was afraid of the word yajna in yoga with that fear that if I do something wrong, rather than cumulating merits, aloe demerits. Therefore, Bhagavan in the previous verse has given us this assurance that this yoga, this Buddhi Yoga, when you perform there is no danger of any adverse effect. And even a little practice you don't have to be an expert.\n\nYou don't have to perform it to a level that you become a master. Even a starting of a little effort also will not go in vain. So it's complete contradiction to what was prevalent in ritualism. In ritualistic practice you have to do it correctly. If you don't do it correctly, it will adverse effect. Here Bhagavan said, no, no, there is no adverse effect in this Yoga, Buddhi Yoga, there is no adverse effect.\n\nYou perform your actions in this manner with equanimity of mind and you will be liberated from all your karma bandana, the bondages of actions. So now Bhagawan is criticizing the people who are using flowery language to make people confused about what is right and what is wrong. And he said Veda Vadharathaha. They take great pleasure and using the words of Vedas Na anyat asti ITI Vadhi Naham. They say there is nothing other than this, other than this, other than this Karma Kanda, other than this rituals, other than to accumulate merits and go to heaven, there is nothing else there. Completely missing the boat.\n\nThe goal of life is to achieve that oneness with yourself, understanding the self. Kamatmana Swarga Paraha. Because they're desirous of achieving Swarga. So the Swarga became the ultimate goal. They said that Veda says that Karmakand, you should be doing all these karmas. When you do, you will accumulate merits and you will go to Swarga.\n\nSo Swarga became the goal of life. Swarga Paraha Janma, Karma Falla Pradha which promises new birth as the renewal of their actions, you will come back again. You will have more Enjoyments and you go to Swargar, Kriya Vishesha Bahula. And there are all kinds of rituals. They don't have one single goal. They also not one single path.\n\nThere are so many desires and so many goals. So now you can say that even though this criticism is for the Karmakanda, if you look at our lives, it is exactly that we are all Karma Kandis. We do all kinds of actions to achieve all types of different results, different accomplishments and achievements. Kriya vi says Bahula. They are engaged in too many different types of activities, too many different types of rituals. Bhoga Aishwarya gatimprati.\n\nBecause we want to achieve the Bhoga and Aishwarya enjoyments and power that became the goal of life then and even now we have no one single goal. And therefore we are not focused. And therefore we cannot achieve what we think is our birthright, which is happiness. Because we lost ourselves into Kriya, we say so. Bhagavan Ved Vyas criticizes those people who have preached that the goal of life is to go to heaven to elevate your standard of living. Now we have come to conclusion that no matter what status you have in the society, what achievement you have, what accomplishment you have, your problems remain the same.\n\nWhether you are working at the lowest rank of the society or you are the highest rank of the society, basic problems which we face, which makes us unhappy, remain exactly the same. So this Bhogaira Aishwarya is not going to give us what we are ultimately looking for, which is happiness. And Bhagawan continues the criticism. Bhogeswarya prasaktanaam taya apruta cheta sam. Their intellect is taken away. They are lost their rational intellect that what will give me happiness?\n\nBecause they are Bhoga Aishwarya Prasaktana then engaged in enjoyment and power. This fixation with the enjoyment and power raising the standard of your living. We lost the goal of life that we want to be happy. It is pure and simple. Vyavasayatmika Buddhism Samadhavna Vidhiyati. Those who are engaged in this variety of activities to achieve varieties of goals, they cannot have the single pointed mind, the single pointed intellect to achieve their oneness with self.\n\nThat oneness with yourself is the only means to achieve happiness. The conclusion of Vedanta so Bhagavan Ved Vyas who wrote the Brahma Sutra as Rishi Badaraya, crystallized this knowledge of Upanishad, saying that the goal of life is to achieve the oneness with your true self. Once you realize your true self, all that which you're seeking, all your life will be yours. Peace and happiness will be your birthright. So far we have learned from Bhagavan the ultimate truth which is revealed in Upanishads. That is Brahma, Satya, Jagat, Mithya, the Atma, Satya, Deha Mithya.\n\nThat which is permanent is Satya. That which is superimposed on the permanent is Mithya. For example, if somebody is wearing a Halloween costume, a child is wearing a Halloween costume and you ask, is that you, Medha? And she said, no, I'm a witch. That which is Mithya, Medha is Satya. Because Medha is permanent, which is the superimposition.\n\nI dropped it like a hot potato. The hotness is superimposed on potato. Because that's not potato's inherent quality, that's an incidental quality superimposed on a potato. Potato borrowed that heat from boiling water or microwaves. That is not inherent in potato. So that hotness, that hot potato is Mithya.\n\nCoronavirus is Mithya. Because the coronavirus by itself has no real activity, it cannot do anything. It's only when there is a host, it manifests as infection. So Bhagavan taught us that this Deha is Mithya. But you, the Atma is satisfied. And therefore Arjuna, you should fight this battle of life.\n\nBut how to fight is then we learnt in the last verse which is Sukhadu khe samy Krutva la Balabha Jayajayo Toto Yudhaya Nayvam Papam, Ovaps that having that equanimity of mind to all these pairs of opposites, Sukhadukha la Balab Jaya Jaya. And then you engage in your life, in your actions, and you will not incur any sin. Now this seems fairly absurd advice. Because how can you be same for Sukha and Dukkha? Dukkha is going to upset me and Sukkah is going to elate me. But Bhagavan said no, this is a reality which if you understand, then you will be able to practice it.\n\nSo for example, if you Go to theme park and you see the people lining for roller coaster ride. So all these people are lining up enthusiastically. They know the nature of roller coaster. They have figured out roller coaster is made up of ascents and descents, twist and turns. Knowing fully well that this is the nature of roller coaster.",
      "reflection": "Take a few moments today to consider: What would change if you truly believed that your essential Self cannot be harmed? Not as a comforting platitude, but as a lived reality?\n\nWhen fear arises today, experiment with asking: 'What is it that's aware of this fear?' That awareness itself is untouched by what it witnesses. This is the key insight of these verses.\n\nNotice the experiences of pleasure and pain that come to you today. Can you see them as contacts between your senses and sense objects—temporary, impermanent, coming and going like waves? Bear them with equanimity, knowing they will pass."

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing Chapter 2, Sankhya Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge. So far we have discussed up to the verse 30, the knowledge of Sankhya, the knowledge about your own self. What is the nature of the self? And then now I'll teach you the Buddhi Yoga. I'll teach you the Yoga of how to implement this knowledge in your life. Buddhi Yoga, Intelligent way of living.\n\nAnd then Bhagavan said, the way to work in this world is to have equanimity. Equanimity comes from your understanding of what you are getting into. If you understand the field of actions, the nature of the field of actions, the equanimity comes easily, naturally. If you do not understand the field of action, then obviously you will have difficulties. And we have used the example of roller coaster. That one who is standing in the line with all the enthusiasm, he knows what is the nature of the roller coaster.\n\nHe anticipates the ups and downs and twists and turns. That's the thrill of riding a roller coaster. If there was no ups and downs and twists and turns, there is no fun in roller coaster. More twists and turns and more ups and downs, that roller coaster more enjoyable then you go back and stand in line again to join. So if you enter this Sansar with the expectation that there will be ups and downs, twists and turns. Sukhaduka Lava Alabha Jaya Jaya.\n\nWell that's the thrill of living in Sansar. So at the end of this life we'll come to the conclusion that that was pretty thrilling ride. Well, let's do it all over again. That's Kurupunar Janma. We'll stand in line again in that Sansa. While we are on that ride we forget that this is what we signed up for.\n\nThat's where problem comes. So Bhagavan said keep that in mind that these are natural and this is what you signed up for. The goal of life is to realize your true self. Which is what Bhagavan said I taught you in the first portion of this discussion. Now I want to tell you how to use that knowledge to realize that ultimate truth, the self, the nature of yourself. Bhagavan Ved Vyas discusses what is the difficulty we have in understanding our Darshan Shastras.\n\nSo we have basically discussed in the beginning there are six schools of thought and the school of thought which is based on the previous portion of Veda called Karmakanda. So all Vedas are divided into four parts. There are the mantras, then Brahmanas, then Aranyakas, and then Upanishads. The philosophy which is more centered around Karmakand. The Brahmana portion is called Purva Vimansa. We have discussed before, in Purva Mimsa, the goal of life is to reach heavens.\n\nAnd in heavens then you will have supra sensuous experiences to make you feel happy. Every good action we perform will create merits. You accumulate enough merits so you can go to Swarga. And in that Swarga, then you will have these enjoyments. When you exhaust your balance of your merits, you will come back again, work again for the more merits and go back to Swarga again. But that's the goal of life in Purva Mimsa.\n\nAnd therefore the society in general placed more emphasis on collecting merits and various ways to do yajnas and rituals. So the means of rituals was supposed to be to purify your mind and intellect so you can become single pointed. But the means became the goal in the society and they completely missed the boat. So now we see the criticism from Bhagavan Ved Vyas that how we have missed that boat as a society. And we have seen time and again in history of India that these philosophers and the great thinkers have come to realign the religion back to its goal. So this spiritual aspect becomes available to all people.\n\nSo it seems that during Mahabharata time the spiritual aspect of the goal was not available to most people. People were stuck into the rituals. So Bhagawan Vedvyas criticizes those people who had been misguiding the generations. So he says in verse 42 yam imam puspitam vacam. Those people using the flowery language are unwise. The unwise people are using flowery language.\n\nThe language used in Brahmana portion of Bhagavadas. He said, they make it sound like that is the goal. Those description rituals are for you to purify your mind and intellectual. But here they have made it sound like that is the goal. This is what you should be doing. Then it became so elaborate and society was so indulgent into it, that average person was afraid of the word yoga or Yajna.\n\nBecause in each ritual it has been said that if you don't perform it correctly then you will incur sin, it will be adverse effect. So you have to have an expert to tell you how to do it. And each ritual became so elaborate that it is very elaborately describe what type of bricks to be used, how the bricks to be arranged for the yajna. So an average person was afraid of the word yajna in yoga with that fear that if I do something wrong, rather than cumulating merits, aloe demerits. Therefore, Bhagavan in the previous verse has given us this assurance that this yoga, this Buddhi Yoga, when you perform there is no danger of any adverse effect. And even a little practice you don't have to be an expert.\n\nYou don't have to perform it to a level that you become a master. Even a starting of a little effort also will not go in vain. So it's complete contradiction to what was prevalent in ritualism. In ritualistic practice you have to do it correctly. If you don't do it correctly, it will adverse effect. Here Bhagavan said, no, no, there is no adverse effect in this Yoga, Buddhi Yoga, there is no adverse effect.\n\nYou perform your actions in this manner with equanimity of mind and you will be liberated from all your karma bandana, the bondages of actions. So now Bhagawan is criticizing the people who are using flowery language to make people confused about what is right and what is wrong. And he said Veda Vadharathaha. They take great pleasure and using the words of Vedas Na anyat asti ITI Vadhi Naham. They say there is nothing other than this, other than this, other than this Karma Kanda, other than this rituals, other than to accumulate merits and go to heaven, there is nothing else there. Completely missing the boat.\n\nThe goal of life is to achieve that oneness with yourself, understanding the self. Kamatmana Swarga Paraha. Because they're desirous of achieving Swarga. So the Swarga became the ultimate goal. They said that Veda says that Karmakand, you should be doing all these karmas. When you do, you will accumulate merits and you will go to Swarga.\n\nSo Swarga became the goal of life. Swarga Paraha Janma, Karma Falla Pradha which promises new birth as the renewal of their actions, you will come back again. You will have more Enjoyments and you go to Swargar, Kriya Vishesha Bahula. And there are all kinds of rituals. They don't have one single goal. They also not one single path.\n\nThere are so many desires and so many goals. So now you can say that even though this criticism is for the Karmakanda, if you look at our lives, it is exactly that we are all Karma Kandis. We do all kinds of actions to achieve all types of different results, different accomplishments and achievements. Kriya vi says Bahula. They are engaged in too many different types of activities, too many different types of rituals. Bhoga Aishwarya gatimprati.\n\nBecause we want to achieve the Bhoga and Aishwarya enjoyments and power that became the goal of life then and even now we have no one single goal. And therefore we are not focused. And therefore we cannot achieve what we think is our birthright, which is happiness. Because we lost ourselves into Kriya, we say so. Bhagavan Ved Vyas criticizes those people who have preached that the goal of life is to go to heaven to elevate your standard of living. Now we have come to conclusion that no matter what status you have in the society, what achievement you have, what accomplishment you have, your problems remain the same.\n\nWhether you are working at the lowest rank of the society or you are the highest rank of the society, basic problems which we face, which makes us unhappy, remain exactly the same. So this Bhogaira Aishwarya is not going to give us what we are ultimately looking for, which is happiness. And Bhagawan continues the criticism. Bhogeswarya prasaktanaam taya apruta cheta sam. Their intellect is taken away. They are lost their rational intellect that what will give me happiness?\n\nBecause they are Bhoga Aishwarya Prasaktana then engaged in enjoyment and power. This fixation with the enjoyment and power raising the standard of your living. We lost the goal of life that we want to be happy. It is pure and simple. Vyavasayatmika Buddhism Samadhavna Vidhiyati. Those who are engaged in this variety of activities to achieve varieties of goals, they cannot have the single pointed mind, the single pointed intellect to achieve their oneness with self.\n\nThat oneness with yourself is the only means to achieve happiness. The conclusion of Vedanta so Bhagavan Ved Vyas who wrote the Brahma Sutra as Rishi Badaraya, crystallized this knowledge of Upanishad, saying that the goal of life is to achieve the oneness with your true self. Once you realize your true self, all that which you're seeking, all your life will be yours. Peace and happiness will be your birthright. So we had been discussing Chapter 2, Sankhya Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge. And so far we have seen that Bhagavan gave us the knowledge of the Sankhya which is teaching us that this self is immortal, this body is mortal.\n\nAt the death of the body, this ego continues its journey, taking along with it the mind and intellect and its tendencies. Based on those tendencies, that ego will continue to exist in various states of existence which we call Janma. Knowing this, that the self is only immortal. If your goal is to have infinite happiness, your goal should be to identify with the self and not with the ego. And to do that is to live your life now with that clear understanding that I am the manifestation, the supreme self, and not the ego, which is identified with this body, mind and intellect, and that way of thinking and acting. Accordingly, he called it Buddha Yoga.\n\nThat's a Buddha Intelligent living, as we call it, knowing fully well what is my goal and how to achieve it, then I put it into practice is the intelligent way of living. So that's called Buddhi Yoga. Keeping in mind, my goal is happiness and nothing other than happiness. Whatever gives me happiness, I will do it. But on our way, we have taken the means for the goal, therefore the means to get happiness, which is to acquire things, to accomplish things. We consider now that to be our goal.\n\nThat's where the problem is. Then he said, why this happens because we have taken the wrong advice from the wrong people. So he criticizes the pundits who had been propagating the words of Vedas. And he said that they use this flowery language and promise all the pleasures and all the lordship here and hereafter. What we call it is Swargalok, that you do this and you will achieve this. So we have this, you know, basically quit for whatever the word is quit for Kuro, type of an arrangement where you do this and you will get this.\n\nAnd he said they uses this language which is so enchanting to you that you're caught into that.",
      "reflection": "Take a few moments today to consider: What would change if you truly believed that your essential Self cannot be harmed? Not as a comforting platitude, but as a lived reality?\n\nWhen fear arises today, experiment with asking: 'What is it that's aware of this fear?' That awareness itself is untouched by what it witnesses. This is the key insight of these verses.\n\nNotice the experiences of pleasure and pain that come to you today. Can you see them as contacts between your senses and sense objects—temporary, impermanent, coming and going like waves? Bear them with equanimity, knowing they will pass."

      "commentary": "We are now discussing Chapter 2, Sankhya Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge. So far we have seen that Bhagavan gave the knowledge of Sankhya. The Sankhya Darshan is Gina Darshan. It takes us step by step what the reality is. From verse 11 through 30 he gave us this Tankhya Darshan, the Gnana Darshan. Then he said that now I'll teach you the Buddhi Yoga which is the application in your life, how to overcome the Prakruti.\n\nSo Sankhya Darshan says that Purusha and Prakruti are two separate entities. When Purusha get involved with Prakruti then all these problems start. The 5 klesa starts, ragadvesha, etc. So yoga sastra says, how to overcome this entanglement with Prakriti. So that Yoga Sastra Bhagavan says, I will now teach you. But Bhagavan coined a new word, Buddhi Yoga Yoga which is established in wisdom.\n\nSo Bhagawan is basically now teaching Arjuna the Yoga Sastra in a very simple format that we all can understand. Arjun, I can understand. We all can understand. We have touched upon a landmark verse in bhagavad git verse 47 last time, which is most quoted verse in Bhagavad Git. Most people quote this verse but only quote the half of it. The first line of it.\n\nYou will hardly ever hear anybody quoting the entire verse. So the first line everybody is very familiar which says Karmanye vadhikarathe ma faleshu kadaa. And we quote that as if that's the instruction in reality, that is the statement of fact. The first line in that verse is statement of fact that you have only control over your actions, you do not have control over the fruits of actions. That's a statement of fact. All of us who can think about it will agree with that, that I can act or the results will come.\n\nI'm not the Karma Falada. Somebody else is either the world Bhagavan whoever you consider, but that's not you. But you do have control over actions. The second line is actually the prescription. The second line is the advice which says Maa karma fala hai turbuhu. Never engage in any action with the expectations of the results.\n\nIt's an advice for us to be wise about how we act. You will never be able to guess what the results would be. You will never have a control over it. There is no reason for you to invest your energy into it. Most of our energies are wasted in regrets of the past or in the anxieties of the future. And then we have less enthusiasm in the present.\n\nSo Bhagavan said, therefore, therefore, never engage in action with a result in your mind. And then the last portion of that verse is mate Sangahatu akarmani. And never get attached to inaction by fear of failure or not having any clear direction. You do not want to get engaged in inaction. Instead it become tamasic. So basically the advice Bhagavan given is very clear.\n\nEngage in action without any expectations. Many commentators said this is where you change from prayers to shrayas. So all Kamya karmas are for prayers. That which is going to be pleasant for me. Those actions which are not driven by the expectation of the fruits will lead you to Shreyas. Because you will be only focusing on the action itself.\n\nSo Bhagavan has given a clear direction and clear statement of the reality we live in. And now in the following verse, Bhagavan clearly demonstrate how one can engage in this activity. Yogastha Kuru Karmani. Establish yourself in yoga. How to practice this Gnana Darshan, this knowledge of the true self. As I said, there are two entities for Sankhya.\n\nPurusha who is always pure. Chaitanya but inactive. Prakruti which is inert but active. Prakriti does not have the consciousness but it is very active. And Purusha which is pure consciousness but inactive. When these two get entangled with each other, then the confusion starts.\n\nMaharishi Patanjali Yoga Sutra said that Yoga Chitta _Verses_ Nirodha Yoga is to stop the activities of your Chitta Paryoga Sastra. The Chitt is like a mirror, it reflects the pure consciousness. But there are Chitta _Verses_. There are modifications which creates this confusion. Basically the function of Chitta from in our day to day life is Pramana. To get knowledge we parse the contrary knowledge, the wrong knowledge we culp doubt sleep or Nidra Thomas and then Smruti's memory.\n\nThese five modifications of Ch create flickering in our Ch. It does not let the consciousness reflect purely. Once these _Verses_ are negated the Purusha is reflected through the Ch in its pure form that basically Yoga Satra Se. But this is very complicated for an average man to understand. So Bhagavan is now clarifying this in a very simple term which you and I can understand and try to practice Yogastha Kuru Karmani. You have to establish yourself in yoga then act outside.\n\nIf you are not established in yoga then actions will be haphazard. They will be driven by the results. Then obviously there will be all the side effects which come along with it. Sangam tyaktva Dhananjaya Swamiji points out this is the most important part of this verse and most people leave that out. Sangam tyaksva act in this world by establishing yourself in yoga and without any attachment. So even attachment to actions themselves in is detrimental.\n\nIf I get too attached to I have to do this, I need to do this then it will be problematic. There may not be opportunity of the particular actions for you to perform. In other words, you should perform the actions which are appropriate and necessary and available in that environment and not have to have the particular actions you're attached to. I will only do this but I will not do anything else. In olden society in India a Brahmin can only do this. He cannot do menial work.\n\nAnd I know in time where there was not enough work the people suffered because they will not go down and say I will do this if this work is not available. The Bhagawan said don't get attached to actions. Whatever actions are available and appropriate, engage yourself into it. No attachment to what type of actions I'm performing also have to establish myself into yoga. Now what that yoga is with an average person gets really frightened. The very word you become a yogi will say oh no, no, I don't want to become a yogi.\n\nI have my own life to live. I want to say no, no that's not Yoga is all about. Yoga is something different. So what Maharishi Patanjali says Ch _Verses_ nirodhaha Bhagavan puts it in a very different way which is very palatable to us. So he said Siddhi asidhi samo Bhatva become even minded to success and failures. Once again going back to the previous verse success and Failures come from the past actions.\n\nThe success and failures which I am experiencing now are actually results of my past actions. I have no control whatsoever on them anymore. I should have gone to medical college and I would have been a doctor and made more money and I'd be considered a frontline worker right now. I cannot change that. And therefore, whatever the results I'm facing right now, whether I consider them to be success or kind of failures, I should be even minded, take them as they are without attaching my likings and dislikings. Siddhiya Siddhi Samo Bhutva Samatvam Yoga Uchate the very first definition in Bhagavad Gita about Yoga Samatvam Yoga Uchate we will see more definitions and therefore this chapter is so important.\n\nThese next three or four verses starting from 47, they are so loaded with meaning and they compressed all the wisdom of Sankhya and Yoga in these few verses that we have to pay lots of attention to understand them. Bhagavan said Siddhi Asidhi Samo Bhatva In a sense do not pay attention to what you are getting because of your past actions. Treat them equally with Prasada Buddhi Engage in your present actions. Do not let your present actions get affected by Siddhiyanes Siddhi which you are facing right now. Samatam Yoga Uchade the balance of mind is Yoga. So we go back to what Maharasi Patanjali said.\n\nYoga Chitta Vritti Nirodha When Chitta is agitated by all these _Verses_ Appropriate knowledge or good knowledge contrary knowledge, memories Nidra Tamas all those _Verses_ are creating impurities in Chitta. That Chitta is not now available to reflect the right knowledge or the right reality is who I am. Bhagawan said Samatam Yoga Chitta this balance of mind which does not get affected either by past nor by anxiety of the future, does not lose any enthusiasm in present in your current actions is Yoga. Once you are established in this, your actions will bear right results in the next verse. How to look at the situation? Durenahi Avaram Karma Buddhi Yoga Dhananjaya Actions which are prompted by desires are far lower than Buddhi Yoga Bhagawan is obviously using a very unique term Buddhi Yoga Buddhi Yoga is Yoga wisdom, intelligent way of living, establishing yourself in Buddhi.\n\nSo again we have discussed before Chitta is a thinking entity. Thinking entity has several functions. We know the three functions are Mana Buddhi And Ahankaar. The Ahankar is always constant. The I feeling is always constant. When that thinking entity is in doubt, it is mind.\n\nSankalpa Vikalpatmaka manah But nische atmika Buddhi Buddhi which is decisive. This is right, this is the truth and this is what I should be working on. But once you establish in that Buddhi, that wisdom, what is right and what is wrong and don't be in that doubtful situation that is Buddhi Yoga. When Chitta is in that nischyatmic mode, it's Buddhi. So Bhagavan said, engage yourself in Buddhi Yoga. That Buddhi Yoga is far better than Karma.\n\nAnd here Karma is only Kamya Karma. Desire prompted actions. Karma Khanda, all the actions all the way up to the desire to get Swarga is all Kamya Karma. Therefore all actions perform for those results. Bhagwan said anytime. Even though they may be the highest form of actions to achieve the best possible state of living or living standard, they are far lower than Buddhi Yoga.\n\nBuddha Sharanam Anmeccha take refuge in Buddhi. This also reminded me of Buddham Sharanam Gachami Dhamma saranam Gachami Sangam saranam gacham. I take refuge in Buddha in the wisdom of Buddha. Here Bhagavan says take refuge in your own wisdom. Buddha Saranam anvicha Krupanaha fala heta vah. Those who are working in this world to get inducive results or get the fruits of their actions all the way up to reaching the heavens.\n\nThey are Krupanaha unfortunate misers. The translation is wretched. So Krupana means miser. Miser is always unfortunate because he never gets to enjoy his own wealth. He has all the wealth but can't enjoy it so he's wretched. Unfortunate people say those people that include all of us who are working for the fruits of actions.\n\nThey are very unfortunate because they will never be able to enjoy fruits of their actions. They will always be in misery, either regretting the past or anxious about the future. They will never be living in present. They are always living in future or in past. They both are hypothetical situation. There is no past that I have experienced and there is no future that I have seen.\n\nAnytime I experience, it is always present. Bhagavan says those people are really unfortunate misers who waste their energies into past and in future and completely ignores the present. O shantihi shri gurubyonamaha harihio. So we had been discussing Chapter 2, Sankhya Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge. And so far we have seen that Bhagavan gave us the knowledge of the Sankhya which is teaching us that this self is immortal, this body is mortal.",
      "reflection": "Take a few moments today to consider: What would change if you truly believed that your essential Self cannot be harmed? Not as a comforting platitude, but as a lived reality?\n\nWhen fear arises today, experiment with asking: 'What is it that's aware of this fear?' That awareness itself is untouched by what it witnesses. This is the key insight of these verses.\n\nNotice the experiences of pleasure and pain that come to you today. Can you see them as contacts between your senses and sense objects—temporary, impermanent, coming and going like waves? Bear them with equanimity, knowing they will pass."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter two. We had been discussing verse 47 onwards, most quoted verse in Bhagavad Gita, which is Karmani Vadikarastha. Between that verse 47 and 53, Bhagavan gives us concisely and succinctly how to live life. Because those scriptures give advice about how to live your life. Sometimes Hinduism is called way of life. So from verse 47 onward, we basically have seen is what is the reality of my life?\n\nReality of my life is I am a living being, a conscious being, and therefore activity is what makes me who I am so active. I must, however, I must understand that only thing which is in my control is my actions. The result of my actions are not in my control simply because there is infinite world out there that is the field of my actions. When I act in this field of my actions, the other forces affect the result of my actions which is not in my control. So I must keep the goal very high, which gives me the directions of my actions. So the goal gives us direction.\n\nBhagavad Gita did not say don't have any goal. It says Karmaniyeva adhikara ste ma faleshukadachan, not the fruits of action. It did not say don't keep any goal or don't plan anything in your life, just continue so keep the goal in your mind and then work accordingly. So the goal gives me direction in which direction I should put my actions. If I'm going from here to New York, I know one thing, I have to drive northward on 95, that my goal is to go to New York. It gives me direction which way to go, so I don't drive south.\n\nWhat it does not give me is what I will encounter on my way while I'm driving. I can generally predict that because I'm driving at 70 miles an hour. New York is 400 miles from here, therefore it takes me all of that, but it does not give me all the other information which affect my reaching New York. Previously we didn't have any way to predict what's going to happen on the way. So we have to rely only on our general judgment. And there was some traffic news broadcast which says what is the traffic pattern today?\n\nThen we have now the gps. We're trying to add more and more ability to predict what is going to affect my travel. My GPS also tells me there is traffic congestion 25 miles from here and it will last for 8 miles. May delay for 15 minutes. So would you like to take a detour? Every time I try to follow my GPS agna to take detour, I'm actually more delayed than the 15 minutes that GPS predicted.\n\nBecause GPS does have some information but not all information. It had information on my main route but didn't really have all the information detour we have to take. So I figured out that I better stay on the same course which I have started and decided. Because the Karma Phala is dependent on not just one factor but many factors which we may not have control over right now or we do not have control over the Bhagavan. Therefore you should not be worried about the Karma Phala because it is not in your hand. Karma is your right, that's in your control.\n\nFind a direction, find a goal in life. Find a direction and work accordingly. Karma Phala may not be because what's going to encounter while you're working, you will not know. And therefore he said ma karma fala hatu bahu. Therefore do not make the fruits as the motivator. We'll reach New York in six hours.\n\nBecause I'm driving at 70 miles an hour, that should not be the motivating force of my driving. My motivation is I need to reach New York and it is in north. Therefore I'm driving northward. I will deal with whatever comes in my way. If I have to take a detour, I'll take a detour. But I will reach New York.\n\nI don't know, but I will reach there. But never get discouraged and say, oh, there is a lot of traffic today. Ma sanghatu akarmani. Do not get attached to inaction because you predict there may be a lot of obstructions on your way. So this is the prescription given to us. Have a goal, find a direction and then continue working.\n\nDo not worry about what you will encounter. So the next verse says Siddhi asiddhi samo bhatva Yogastha kurukarman. Establish yourself in yoga and then work. I Don't go to yoga classes. Panditi keep telling me but I keep avoiding. So now I can't do anything about it.\n\nYogastha kurukaraman established into a state of mind where this Siddhi Asiddhi does not affect you. I have to go to New York but right near the Ashland there's a huge traffic jam. That doesn't make me to make a U turn and come back home. Goal is to go there somehow to find a way to get over this. Therefore he said siddhi asidhi samo bhatva. Whatever comes in your way, take it equally.\n\nThis is still part of your life. So the yoga is samatvam Yoga uchade. So I should be establishing yoga. I say it's very simple. Keep your mind even in whatever situation you encounter. In other words, keep.\n\nKeep that goal still in your mind. Don't let that obstruction in your way discourage you. Your goal is to achieve that infinite happiness. Don't get discouraged. Siddhiya Siddhi Success and failure is part of your life because it is guaranteed that sometimes you will succeed, most of the time you will fail. We used to have the statistics what is our hit rate on our proposals and for a while I did that because I was trained by my previous employers to have the hit rate.\n\nThen I said boy these hit rates look very poor. Let's not look at it, let's stop this thing. Just keep doing what you are doing because if you get discouraged by the results then you will stop acting. Goal is to achieve what you want to achieve. So Bhagawan said samatam yoga uchathe keep your mind equanimous in all situation with the success or failures. That's very necessary because failures are going to be there.\n\nAnd then when you work in that manner you will be applying your full focus and therefore you will be very efficient in your actions. So we saw the next definition of yoga's Yogaha Karma Sukhaoshalam. When do I consider myself to be established in the samatvam? My actions become efficient. We all know that when I am efficient, when I'm fully focusing on what I'm doing, I sometimes take work home and say well rather than doing it, I'll take work. Then I also want to watch the shows which I have missed last time and they are on DVR now, all recorded.\n\nI'm trying to do my work and trying to pay attention to that. What are the show going on? See the work was Supposed to take me two hours, take me about eight hours. And then I said the whole weekend I was working. Anil, you are truly not working eight hours. So I am not efficient in my actions.\n\nWhen my actions are efficient, I should consider myself to be established in yoga. That was the prescription in the beginning. Bhagavan said Yogasthakura Karmani, establish yourself in yoga, have your mind steady and focused and work in this world. That's the way of life. That's why I say Hinduism teaches you what is the way of life. And succinctly told you how to be successful and happy in life.\n\nThe next few verses say, the one who now established in this yoga, he gives up all this Sukruta duskrita Buddhi yukto jahaati ha ubhe sukruta duskrita. Once you are completely focused in doing your best, you will not be affected by the results or whether it is a good or bad. You know you have done your best. You couldn't have done any better than this. The law of karma says the actions which have put will bear results sooner or later. It does happen that sometimes I go to some client and make a presentation he doesn't give me.\n\nBut he then tells somebody else two years from then said why don't you talk to such and such. I thought he was pretty good. He didn't give me job but he refers me to somebody. And that third person comes and gives me a job. Because I put my efforts in the presentation to first get. I don't make that connection.\n\nTherefore my mind cannot see why I'm getting this work but not that one. That's the law of karma. What I call it Prarabdha is not something completely random which is happening to my life but something happening in present. I cannot make a connection to my past actions. I call it my Prarabdha. So therefore Bhagavan says, one who acts in this world with that even mindedness he will be beyond sukruta duskrita.\n\nHe will be beyond good and bad. Many people used to say or still say doing good is good enough. Why do I have to worry about all these things? And Karma Yoga and this yoga just do good in life. Actually I remember Subhas Pahuja. He came to this class few times before he passed away.\n\nAnd his standard thing why do you have to learn Bhagavad Gita? I know doing good is good and I said that Bhagavan says doing good is not good enough. Why that good is Binding you, the expectation of good results and that becomes your golden chain. Every time I do good, I expect at least somebody will recognize. And nil gurja or granddaughter, when she does something, she is looking around and say whether everybody is paying attention. Then if nobody pays attention, she herself says medha is so smart.\n\nThat's our true nature. We want recognition right from the childhood. We want to see around whether anybody's paying attention. Because I'm doing good but nobody's paying attention. What is good about that? So that good is binding me to good results in good vasanas but still vasanas.\n\nTherefore Bhagawan said, you will be relieved from both the good and bad if you focus on your actions only and not the results. Results are guaranteed. Something which is guaranteed, you don't have to worry about it. We know sun will rise tomorrow. We don't have to last night agonize what will happen tomorrow morning Will the sun rise? We know it is guaranteed.\n\nResults of accidents are guaranteed. And therefore you shouldn't be worried about that. Karmajam, budhiyuktahi, falam taktva, manishinah, janma, bandha, vinur muktaha, padam gachanti, anamayam. We are afraid of all the evils in this world which creates sorrows in our life. And Bhagavan said, the one who is established in this yoga and working in this world he will go beyond anamayam. He will go beyond all evils.\n\nKarma jam buddhiktahi falam kyakvam. Those wise one possessed of this knowledge who has given up the karma phala, given up in a sense given up the anxiety about karma phala. Whatever is in my way. They get janma, bandha, vinir muktaha. They get relieved from the cycles on birth and death. It's obviously very, very Hindu concept of the punar janma.\n\nBut even in this life I take this position and then I take that position. Every position I take in this life is because of what? Because of my vasanas. I went to be a president of this and I want to be the chairperson of this. I want to be on this board. I want to do this is driven by my vasanas, my egocentric desires.",
      "reflection": "Take a few moments today to consider: What would change if you truly believed that your essential Self cannot be harmed? Not as a comforting platitude, but as a lived reality?\n\nWhen fear arises today, experiment with asking: 'What is it that's aware of this fear?' That awareness itself is untouched by what it witnesses. This is the key insight of these verses.\n\nNotice the experiences of pleasure and pain that come to you today. Can you see them as contacts between your senses and sense objects—temporary, impermanent, coming and going like waves? Bear them with equanimity, knowing they will pass."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter two, Sankhya Yoga Yoga of Knowledge. So far we have seen that this chapter is divided in four segments. First few verses Arjuna says, I am Navirsheshya. I don't know what to do. You tell me without any option what is good for me. Second, we have seen what Bhagavan responded in his response and said, you shouldn't be worried about anything that is happening in this world simply because what you see happening is temporary.\n\nThere's nothing in this world which is permanent because all your experiences are the senses coming in contact with the sense objects. That one which you are worried about yourself is immortal. There is no death for it, there is no birth for it. So is the case for his self herself, myself. Therefore there is no worry about the self. Everything else is temporary.\n\nSo why worry about that? Anyway, that was the knowledge part. And then he said how to practice that now that you know that it does not make your life easier. Just because I went to Gita class does not make my life easier. On Monday through Friday he said on Monday through Friday what you should do is act your must just like you were acting before. But establish yourself in yoga.\n\nYoga is the equanimity of mind. When you establish yourself, your mind into an equanimity that things will continue to change outside. But I will remain same in dealing with them, whether they are conducive or inconducive. Say Samatvam Yoga Uchiha Daya Equanimity of mind is Yoga. When do I know that my mind is equanimous? When you become skillful in your actions.\n\nWhen your actions become crystallized and precise and efficient. You should know that you have established yourself in Yoga Samatvam Yoga Uchide and Yoga Karmasu Kaushalam. So one is the definition. There is actually a test. If your accents are hafizar, even though you think you are in yoga, you are not. Because in a yogi's accents will be all precise and dexterous.\n\nLot of time in My life I have seen. Swami Chinnamanda says something seems absolutely ridiculous, that it's not gonna happen. Somehow it all falls into place. But when I think from my logic should not work at all. But for him, if he says this should happen by this time and this will happen by this time and you should do this, he will have. Because he is a mind of a yogi who can see through how to get things done.\n\nMine is the mind of a Bhogi who cannot see how this can ever happen. So Bhagavan said, that's your test. Yoga Karmasu Kaushalam. When we practice something over and over and over again, we become so efficient. I used to practice music. My teacher said, keep practicing.\n\nYou will get it before you know when you will get it. You will never know when you got it. But then you will know what is the Madhya Sapta kana Mantra Sapta kana taar Sapta. Practice makes you perfect. Once you achieve that art, you don't have to make any efforts driving Karmasukaushalam. I don't have to make any effort.\n\nI don't even think about it while driving. Because it is Karmasur Kaushalam, I am established into the Yoga of driving. Therefore, Bhagavan says, that's equanimity of mind. We come to this conclusion very quickly that this is not possible. This is just for yogis, you know, like Swami Chinmayananda and Buddha and Mahavir and not for us. So the question, okay, if that's the case, how do we know that someone is established in yoga?\n\nSo you ask a question. So Arjun asked the question, this pragna is tita whose intellect is steady. We saw the definition Samatvam Yoga Uchate. So one's intellect once becomes steady, he becomes sthita pragna. Because that pragna is not changing no matter what the outside situation is. It may be very dark in this room, but I know it is there.\n\nBecause my prajna is titaha in the knowledge that it is daytime right now. Even if you turn off light, even if there is clouds outside and it becomes very dark, I still say it's daytime. Because I know it is daytime. Because my prajna is completely sthida in that knowledge. The knowledge which Bhagavan gave in the first section that you are not the mortal being, you are the immortal being. Your self is immortal.\n\nEverything else is just passing experiences. Once that knowledge takes Place in the intellect. No matter what happens in my life, it does not change my understanding of that fact. If that happens to somebody who establishes himself in their knowledge, what is the description of such a person? How would I know such a person? So arjuna in verse 54 asked that question.\n\nSthita prajnasya ka bhasha samadhisthasya keshava. We know Samadhistha who is established in samadhi. Sa samadhi buddhi buddhi which is steady. We use this word samadhi in a very metaphysical way. Samadhi is a firm conviction that this is the reality. Parmiti Jamanda and one Upanishad class told us that you are in a complete state of samadhi right now of your body consciousness.\n\nNobody has to remind me who I am. No matter what situation changes. Outside, it is dark, it is light. If everybody's here, nobody's here. This is me that never changes. You can convince me, if you are persuasive enough that this class does not exist.\n\nI am just hallucinating. Neil, you need some help. You are hallucinating. You're talking to yourself. Possible that I will believe that and will start seeking advice from Prakash Ethagee or somebody like him. But you can't convince me that I don't exist.\n\nNo matter how confused I am. But this body is actually immortal. So therefore you shouldn't be worried about it. Your samadhi should be in this immortality. So Arjuna asks questions, says Bhagavan, how would that person who is established in the samadhi of his self, immortal self. Because intellect is so steady that no matter what happens, he never loses that touch with that Samadhi.\n\nWhat is his description? To speak, Bhasa is describing. That's why the language is called Bhasha. Because we describe what we think through our speech. So what is his description of such a person? Swami Chinmayananda used to get this question all the time.\n\nSwamiji, are you realized? Swamiji, there is a conundrum here. If I tell you that I am realized, then what would you say? He tells everybody he's realized. Now if Swamiji says I'm not realized, why am I wasting time with you? If after all this, you are not realized, what am I going to get out of you?\n\nSo there is no way to find out one is realized or not. Only another Realized person will know who this realized person is, one who is a good singer. If somebody sings, he knows he's a good singer. For us, everybody is a good singer. But one who really knows music, he knows when the other person is doing well or not. So Arjuna said, how would I know that such a person exists?\n\nOr this can be achievable. Give me some description, give me some idea. And now all I can do is judge people by how they behave, right? I can't really go into their mind and say they are established in samadhi, but I can see from their behavior. Therefore, the second line says, sthita dihi Kim Prabhasheta Kim Asita Vrajeta Kim. This is indicative of knowing how a person with that level of establishment in Yoga will be behaving in this world.\n\nHow does he walk, how does he sit? Prabha cheta talk Kim Asita. How does he sit down and how does he walk? Basically, in indicative words, to know what would be his outward behavior. Now our problem is, once we know the outward behavior, somebody says, somebody will be sitting like this, somebody will be talking like that, somebody will be doing like that. Now we are trying to see that in a person and then basically come to the conclusion he is not.\n\nBecause he is not fitting into my description of how Sthita Pragna should be a muni. He should be sitting. So our idea of muni is sitting in Himalaya somewhere who is completely secluded from people, not interacting with people, not getting emotionally upset or emotionally charged with any situation. So we'll say, Swami Chinmayananda, I don't know. Swamiji still gets angry. And it says that Vitaraga Bhayakrodha is still angry.\n\nThe answer was, if I go to the ocean and try to see the ocean in a wave, and if I only see the characteristics of the wave, only thing I will see is the wave. Only never see the ocean in the wave, the wave its own characteristics. If I'm focusing on those characteristics, I only see wave in it. But if I see that the wave is nothing but the ocean rising and falling, I will see the ocean in it. So Arjuna wants to know, how do I know that a person like that exists? Tell me some description, give me some idea.\n\nHow will he behave in any situation? This is more like that bracelet these Christians have for the teenager, says wwjd what would Jesus do? This was, I think, a brilliant idea. Whoever came up with that, the teenagers, when they are in a dilemma, in some peer Press in school or whatever. What should I do when everybody's asking me to smoke? But my parents say you're not supposed to smoke.\n\nHe said, look at that person. WWJD what would Jesus do in this situation? How do I know what to do in a situation I'm encountering? How would a realized person would act in this situation? So the answer comes in the following verses till the end of the chapter. What a realized person will do in different situations.\n\nOnce your mind is steady, your excellence will be effortless. And then you will know in each situation how to react to that situation. Things and beings outside will continue to remain exactly as they are. As the Prakriti says, constantly changing. How would I react will change if my mind is equanimous. So that's basically the gist of this question.\n\nSo the answer is Prajahati Yadakaman Sarvan Partha Manogata first thing is who has given up all the desires? Sarvan Kaman Manogata is the operative word. Born out of my mental agitations. One who gives up all the desires born out of mind. What is our primordial desire to be happy? I want to be comfortable and happy.\n\nBut out of this primordial desire to be happy, all other desires have come into this one. If I didn't have that desire to be happy and be okay with any situation, it looks like the guy is going to be a stone. A dead person who has no reaction to anything good or bad. It can only happen when I die. After I die, people can kick me. I'm fine, put me and throw me in a well.\n\nI'll be fine because I'm not there. But while I'm leaving, I'll be very careful. So they say, is that person be any different than all of us? However, he will be different from you in this following manner. Prajahati Yada Kaman Sarvart Manogata Right now I have decided that all these desires when I fulfill, I'll be happy. A realized person do not have those desires.\n\nThat does not mean that he does not become thirsty and he won't have desire to drink water. Actually Swami Tejamma and they categorize all the desires and say these desires which you can fulfill easily, don't even bother about them. Why are you suffering? That's not the Manogatan desires we are talking.",
      "reflection": "Take a few moments today to consider: What would change if you truly believed that your essential Self cannot be harmed? Not as a comforting platitude, but as a lived reality?\n\nWhen fear arises today, experiment with asking: 'What is it that's aware of this fear?' That awareness itself is untouched by what it witnesses. This is the key insight of these verses.\n\nNotice the experiences of pleasure and pain that come to you today. Can you see them as contacts between your senses and sense objects—temporary, impermanent, coming and going like waves? Bear them with equanimity, knowing they will pass."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter two, Sankhya Yoga Yoga of Knowledge. We have seen so far that in verses 47 and 48, Bhagavan has given the clear instruction about how to act in this world. Bhagawan said, Karmani ev adhi ka rahati ma faleshu kadachana ma karma falahe turbuhu mate Sangatva Karmani. Your right is only to act, never for the fruits, never work for just getting the fruits, and also never get attached to inaction. But then he gave us a very positive message saying how to act in this one. Say Yogastha kuru Karmani Sangam tyaktva Dhananjaya Siddhi asidhi samo Bhutva samatam Yoga uchathe.\n\nVery clear instruction that establish yourself in yoga. And then he defined yoga for us, Samatvam Yoga uchate, the balance of mind is yoga. You establish in that state of mind where it is balanced. And then Sangam tyaktva, without any attachment, you act in this world. Siddhi asidhi samo bhatva be equal to success and failure. That is the total instruction for Karma Yoga.\n\nIf we remember just these two verses, then we have learned the entire message of Bhagavad Gita. Then people like us will say, is that really a watered down version Bhagavan is giving me and Arjuna probably felt the same way. So he uses two very, very familiar terms in the discussion of Yoga. Probably Arjuna learnt in his time at the Gurukul Prajna and Samadhi. These two terms are elaborately described in Yoga Sutra. He uses those words in asking questions.\n\nYou see, if that is the case, just the balancing the mind is yoga, then what are all these discussions about yogis? The yogis spend their lifetime in practicing yoga. So in Ashtangi Yoga, samadhi comes the final stage, a samadhi. So he wanted to know that we are talking about the same yoga. So he asked Bhagavan Tita pragnasya kabhasha sama Dhisthasya keva Sthita dhi Kim prabhaseta Kim asita brajeta. So he said, okay, if that's the case, can you please explain to me what is the description of Sthita Pragna?\n\nPragna Consciousness. So Aitre Upanishad says Prajnanam Brahma. We learnt in four Mahavakyas. This is the first Mahavakya. Consciousness is Brahman Prajna which is pure consciousness. One who is established in that is the Sthita Prajna.\n\nOne who is clearly identifying with the consciousness and not identifying with this BMI is the Sthita Pragna. He says, if that is the case, can you please explain to me what is the description of that Sthita Prajna who is established in pure consciousness and how Samadhisthasya he is established in Samadhi. He is constantly in the state of Samadhi. So Samadhi's effortless awareness is Samadhi right now. Effortless awareness about my own self as this limited being. No efforts required for me to recognize this is me.\n\nFour that Sthita Prajna Yogi. No effort required to realize that he is pure consciousness. Sthita Prajna who is established in Samadhi who recognizes that his self is nothing but consciousness. Describe to me that person. Is it same as what you described as Samatam Yoga? Uchad Sthita Dhi Kim Prabhasyeta Asyata Vrajeta.\n\nAnd what will be his behavior? Will he be different than what you and I see everybody else doing? So he wanted to clarify that we are talking about the same state of Sthita Prajna achieving through this Karma Yoga. This yoga which Bhagavan said is as simple as continue doing what you are doing, but change your attitude by changing the attitude that you are not doing it for the fruits but because it ought to be done. And then whatever the results come, accept them as Prasad. I will accept them whether success or failure, without having any judgment of my own.\n\nSo Bhagavan responded, the next verse which we have seen is verse 55. Bhagawan simply says Prajahati yada kaman Sarvan Parthumanogadan. One who gives up all the desires from the mind. In other words, he empties the mind. Atmaniyeva atmane tusta. One who is satisfied in the self by the self is Sthita Prajna.\n\nIt is as simple as that. One who has no desires, one who has completely emptied his mind is a Sthita prajna. So Bhagavan responded to his question describes Sthita prajna. Bhagavan said very simple. One who has completely emptied his mind and his content is satisfied by self in the self is a Sthita prajna which is not different than what Yoga Sutra describes as Yoga Chitta vrutti Nirodha. Yoga is the cessation of activities in Chitta.\n\nThis agitation in Chitta. As we have seen, Chitta is basically the total sum of mind. Intellect in Ahankar is Chitta. When mind is not functioning, having any desires, intellect is not judging and there is no sense of I the doer, then there is no Chitta prati. In the same day Bhagawan said that when you empty your mind completely of all desires, then Vasthita pragna. The next question Arjuna had was then explain to me how will he behave in this world?\n\nBhagawan said Dukesu anudvigna manah he will be not agitated by Dukkha. His mind will not agitate when the Dukkha comes because he already anticipated that living in this world, Dukkha is bound to come. As Bhagavan Buddha figured out that Dukkha exists. That's his first revelation. Second is there's a cause for Dukkha and if you remove the cause Dukkha so the Sthida pragna. Knowing that, he said Dukesu anudvagna manah.\n\nHis mind doesn't agitate with Dukkha because it is something natural in this world. Sukesu vigathas pruhaha. When he encounters a conducive situation, he does not create more desires to experience that again and again and again, which is a typical case in our situation. Something which you like, you want to keep repeating it. Something which you don't like, we want to avoid it. Vitaraga Bhayakrodha when he becomes without any attachment, fear and anger.\n\nSo Bhagavan in these two verses already described what Arjuna asked for what is the description? Sthita Pragna is one without any desires in his mind. This is Sthita Pragna that simple. And secondly, how will he behave in this world? Well, he will behave very differently than a common man will behave. Common man gets agitated when Dukkha comes and gets all attached to Sukkah.\n\nContrary that this Muni will not be agitated by Dukkha and he will not long for this Sukkah to keep coming over and over again because he knows that that's not reality. It does not happen that way in this world. The remaining verses in chapter two basically elaborate on his answer. So Bhagavan is now elaborating on the description of Sthita pragna. Yaha Sarvatra Anabhis Neha Tattat prapya subu Asubham. So first thing he said.\n\nYa Sarvatra Anabhi Snaha. He is everywhere without Sneha. He avoids Sneha everywhere. Well, this doesn't sound good to us. Sneha is something we live for in our vernacular language. This word is very, very pleasant.\n\nIn Dear, Sneha is in olden days. I remember when I was a little kid. The letter writing was the only means of communication. We'll start with Bhai Rajesh, Tatha Anya Snehi Jana in Gujarati, Brother Rajesh and all others. All the people I'm attached to in the family Richmond Ni Yad from Richmond Nilkanti is remembering you all because I'm attached to you. So Snehi Jan I have attachment to.\n\nBhagavan says he is Yaha Sarvatra Anabisneha. He is not attached to anyone. So it's not a negative connotation. What it really means is he is equal to all. There is no partiality that I like this person. But I don't like that person.\n\nI mean indifferent to that, to that thing and attached to this thing. When I'm attached to everything then there is no differentiation between one or the other. I am attached to all limbs in my body. So it's not that I am attached to my right hand more than my left hand. Therefore he said Yasarvatra Anabhis Nehah. There is no partiality.\n\nBhagavan is equal to all. Because Bhagavan knows that this is just me everywhere. Same way the Muni who is established in pure consciousness. He knows that there is nothing. There is no other reality than the consciousness alone. Consciousness is Brahman.\n\nThat Brahman is all pervading. And basis for all things and beings is consciousness. If I am that consciousness. There is no reason for me to get attached to something Elseubham. And then even though I am a realized person, Subha Anasuba will keep coming from Prakriti. It will go on as Prakriti is designed.\n\nSo Subha and Asubha comes. When Subha comes, he does not congratulate. Again we have a problem here. Well, this is what we leave for we want congratulations. When something good happens, does this mean that I will not congratulate my son or a grandson or granddaughter who graduates from high school or college and celebrate? He does not go himself.\n\nSee, we typically congratulate ourselves when we succeed in something. Something good happens to us. I did this just before the great crash. I sold all my equity. We congratulate ourselves. Muni never congratulates himself.\n\nTat prapya subham na abhinandati. When Subham comes, he does not congratulate himself and say, good job, Neel. He knows that everything is possible because this consciousness is functioning through me and this world is functioning as per the laws of nature. And laws of nature include law of karma. I had done something good. Something good came to me.\n\nWhen Asubham comes, he does not hate himself. Our problem is either we like ourselves or we hate ourselves. It's not congratulating others to encourage our children, encourage our friends, encourage our relatives when they succeed. It is not that we tell them not to do something which is going to hurt them. They don't going to embrace things which are going to hurt. Don't go into a mass rally to get coronavirus infection.\n\nI don't hate coronavirus. That's not the intent. Intention here is to say when I continue to congratulate myself when I succeed and I hate myself when I fail, that has to stop. If my mind is empty, then this will not happen. Tashya prajna pratishtita. Such a person is established in consciousness.\n\nPrajna, as we have seen, is pure. Consciousness is prajna. The higher form of awareness is prajna. This is another way of looking at it. That that person will be always happy in whatever is happening. Neither he is congratulating himself nor is he hating himself.\n\nSuccess and failures come because my past actions. I may have made mistakes. I may have done something good. Things are going to keep happening. Yada samharte kurmu angani iwas sarvasah. He lives a very intelligent life.\n\nHe does not put himself in a danger just as a tortoise detects danger. He withdraws all his limbs under his shell to protect himself. He does not make himself vulnerable to threat which is perceived a muni. When he perceives there is a threat outside of getting attached to sense objects, he withdraws his senses. Something which I have a likelihood of getting attached to, I withdraw my sense from that so there is no real reason for us to challenge ourselves and say let me see. Even in that adverse situation also can I maintain.\n\nSo instead of meditating in my room where I have established myself, I'm going to go and meditate in a bar. Even though everybody is enjoying, but I'll be meditating. Well, that's not a very smart way to leave. The Bhagavan said Cha ayam indriyani indi arthe biha tasya pragna pradeshita uma who lives an intelligent life of avoiding things which are dangerous. Dangerous to my state of mind, which will agitate my mind. I may get attached, then I will have fear and then I have anger.\n\nI would rather not get into that situation.",
      "reflection": "Take a few moments today to consider: What would change if you truly believed that your essential Self cannot be harmed? Not as a comforting platitude, but as a lived reality?\n\nWhen fear arises today, experiment with asking: 'What is it that's aware of this fear?'

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 2, Sankhya Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge. And as we have seen, this chapter is in four parts and we are in the last part which describes the characteristics of a man of wisdom, a perfect person who has learned how to live in this life intelligently. So this segment is called Sthita Prajna. Lakshana is basically a virtual role model created for us by Bhagavan Krishna. What a perfect person should be, how he acts in this world, and how he conducts himself. Bhagavan gave a very succinct definition of a Sthita Prajna.\n\nThe one who has emptied his mind of all desires, one who feels complete, he does not feel incomplete and therefore he does not have to acquire anything or accomplish anything to feel complete. So the person who has emptied his mind of all desires, he becomes Vita Raga Bhayakroda. He becomes devoid of any attachment, fear or anger. So that's basically a simple definition of a man of perfect wisdom, that he has no desire, he feels complete, he has no attachment, and therefore he has no fear and no anger. And then Bhagawan also described that what is that steady wisdom? What is that steady Buddhist which can make person achieve this state of having no attachment, fear and anger.\n\nAnd he said that one who does not get affected by any happening, whether conducive or unconducive, he does not get agitated by unconducive happening. He also does not get carried away by conducive happening. Conducive experience does not create longing in him. An unconducing experience does not create any grief or agitation in his mind. So this is basically a state of constant enthusiasm. He's constantly enthusiastic about living his life in a perfect state of mind.\n\nReminds me of my last boss, basically when I left my last office and started NBG architecture. He was a unique person, full of energy. Anytime I'll go to him and say, dan, we have a new project. He'll get excited, tell me what to do. He'll be always encouraging. But the unique thing was When I go to him and tell him that Dan, you know, we have a problem in this project.\n\nAnd somebody's going to file a claim against us for errors and omniscience. Some of the things which we always dread to go to your boss and tell him because he will be disappointed. How can you do this, Neil? On the contrary, Dan will be all enthusiastic. Okay, if that's the case, let's do this. Call such and such person.\n\nLet's make sure we do this enthusiasm in both cases I found very unique. He will not get upset because we have now a potential claim against us. But he will get all excited and say let's make sure that we are prepared to deal with it. I will never forget that. And it's now 20 years since I left the job. He now became the head of the entire organization which has 2100 people.\n\nThat shows what a person who can maintain his enthusiasm in all situations can achieve. In my own life, I've seen people achieving that. For one said that such a person, his intellect is steady. He does not get affected. His enthusiasm for acting in this world is not affected by the experience he is experiencing. So number one defined a role model.\n\nA man of perfect wisdom. So we come to the conclusion if we achieve that state, we got it made. We don't have to do anything after that. Bhagavan said, no, you have to be very careful. So then Bhagavan gives us a warning that be aware that your senses are very powerful. Indriyani Pramatini, Harati Prasabham Manaha.\n\nIt can take away the tranquility of mind. Because the very nature of senses is to go out and get impressions of all the objects. So what we know about objects is not really the actual nature of the object but what we have perceived about that object. That is the nature of senses. Those perceptions created on my mind. If my mind is not careful or it's not under the control of my intellect.\n\nThen it will get carried away again. And then it will lose its tranquility. So Bhagavan said, be careful. Therefore, a man of perfect wisdom moves around in this world like a tortoise that whenever it senses danger, it withdraws all its limbs. So man of perfect wisdom does not give up this world of plurality. He has to live in this world where he lives with his senses under control of his mind.\n\nSo mind is under the control of the intellect and senses are under the control of the mind. That is basically the state of a Perfect wisdom, Bhagavan Seta. So he moves around in that fashion. That is what we have seen in the last two verses. And it says everything starts from constant contemplation on sense object Visayan pansah. That is the root cause of all my troubles.\n\nWhen I constantly think about something, it becomes my nature. And once I attach myself to the world of finite objects, then now I'm going to assign my happiness to that object that I have now mortgaged. My happiness to the world of objects. And therefore now I have to acquire them because my happiness mortgage with them. Bhagawan said that is the ladder of fall. He started thinking about something that created attachment.\n\nThat attachment creates desires. The desires unfortunately creates anger. Anger created delusion. That delusion created loss of intellect. And loss of intellect gets you destroyed. So this is the fall which we have seen.\n\nSo that means I have to work with the root cause of my problem is Bhagavan Buddha in his Arya Satya. He says, the first Sathya is that Dukkha exists. There is Dukkha in this world. The second one is that there is a cause for Dukkha. And what is the cause for Dukkha? Desire is the cause for all Dukkha.\n\nSo Bhagavan says the same thing here. Dhyaya TOU visayyanpunsa. He is the cause for all the problems. So how do I live in this world? The next three verses actually describe how to get out of this danger. Falling from this ladder of fall.\n\nIt says Ragtayhi to visayan indriyesh charan atma vashehi vide prasadam adhigh. So countering that tendency of thinking about objects and then getting attached to them and then falling into that trap, he said, the man of wisdom who has now realized, as we were discussed last time, that attachment is a mental phenomenon or a mental concept. Because my mind gets impression from the world of objects, it gets attached. Detachment, on the other hand, is very intellectual pursuit. Knowing fully well that this attachment is going to create sorrows for me, I try to detach myself from those attachments. How do I detach myself?\n\nBhagawan says raga dwese vyuktaihi to one who is devoid of likes and dislikes, Bhagawan has given us pointer how to become that. He said Tani sarvani samyamya yukta asita matparaha. In verse 61 he said, Here is the key. You will not be able to control your senses unless you have a higher goal. Turn your mind towards the higher goals. If your higher goal is engaging your mind then the impressions coming out of this world is not going to affect it.\n\nIt will not disturb it. When we are engrossed in doing something we are not aware of what's happening around us. Yukta, Asita, Matparaha. Have me in your mind all the time. Now that again sounds really ridiculous. Goal to have that my mind is always focused on Bhagavan.\n\nTherefore I cannot think of anything else. No, actually once you realize that then nothing exists other than me. Everything you see, you should see me. Once I see all the objects are nothing but manifestations of the God. The impression of that object on my mind will be more divine than a finite image of that object. If you start seeing me in all things and beings then you will be able to control your mind.\n\nIf I see Bhagavan all supreme being, all things and being then question of likes and dislikes really does not come. I cannot have one part of Bhagavan I don't like. Another part of Bhagavan I like. That's truly not possible. We like everything about that person. Even his shortcomings we enjoy his shortcoming.\n\nBut person we don't like. Even his good qualities we don't enjoy. So once we identify with that supreme self, all his manifestations we will enjoy them all as they are. Because we will not have any judgment about an individual manifestation. So Bhagavan says Sachapa Raga, Dwese Viuktahi. Person who has become devoid of likes and dislikes.\n\nVisayan Indre Charan. He moves around in this world of objects. Because there is no escape from this world of objects. We are part of this world and we have to live in this world. What do we want to achieve? We have to achieve within this world.\n\nBut how we act in this world is up to us. So I said one who is devoid of likes and dislikes. He is moving around with Atma Vashyahi, Vidhey Atma. He is self restrained. He is not getting carried away by one experience or the another. Vidheyatma, his self control.\n\nPrasadam Adhi Gachadhi. He achieves that final result. And as we have discussed Prasad many times before, we are used to word Prasad after every puja we have Prasad. That Prasad is always sweet. That because the fruits of all my good actions sweet results. Here the result is tranquility of Mind the mind because it's not getting any impression which is negative.\n\nNo matter what impression comes from outside it sees a divine impression and therefore it is in a state of tranquility that is the prasad that's my final reward. Then nothing can upset my mind. Bhagavan said such a person Prasadam Adhighti achieves that final tranquility of mind that no experience can disturb the tranquility of mind. So Bhagawan says get out of likes and dislikes, see mean everything and then your mind will be constantly focused on me. Prasade Sarva Dukkha nam haani Yashi upa Jayate this is where we started. I want to learn Bhagavad Gita because I need to get rid of all my Dukkhas.\n\nI want to get Bhagavan's Kupa because I want to get rid of all my sorrows and unhappiness. Bhagavan says there is a way to do it and it is not my doing, it is your doing. You have to do it yourself. When you control your mind, when you get out of likes and dislikes then you will get prasad of your own actions which with the tranquility of mind that tranquility of mind actually it removes the cause for all your sorrows. Bhagavan Buddha said there is a Dukkha and there is a cause for Dukkha and all you have to do is remove the cause for your Dukkha and then you achieve that Kaivalyam Prasadu Khanam.

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 2, Sankhya Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge. And as we have seen, this chapter is in four parts and we are in the last part which describes the characteristics of a man of wisdom, a perfect person who has learned how to live in this life intelligently. So this segment is called Sthita Prajna. Lakshana is basically a virtual role model created for us by Bhagavan Krishna. What a perfect person should be, how he acts in this world, and how he conducts himself. Bhagavan gave a very succinct definition of a Sthita Prajna.\n\nThe one who has emptied his mind of all desires, one who feels complete, he does not feel incomplete and therefore he does not have to acquire anything or accomplish anything to feel complete. So the person who has emptied his mind of all desires, he becomes Vita Raga Bhayakroda. He becomes devoid of any attachment, fear or anger. So that's basically a simple definition of a man of perfect wisdom, that he has no desire, he feels complete, he has no attachment, and therefore he has no fear and no anger. And then Bhagawan also described that what is that steady wisdom? What is that steady Buddhist which can make person achieve this state of having no attachment, fear and anger.\n\nAnd he said that one who does not get affected by any happening, whether conducive or unconducive, he does not get agitated by unconducive happening. He also does not get carried away by conducive happening. Conducive experience does not create longing in him. An unconducing experience does not create any grief or agitation in his mind. So this is basically a state of constant enthusiasm. He's constantly enthusiastic about living his life in a perfect state of mind.\n\nReminds me of my last boss, basically when I left my last office and started NBG architecture. He was a unique person, full of energy. Anytime I'll go to him and say, dan, we have a new project. He'll get excited, tell me what to do. He'll be always encouraging. But the unique thing was When I go to him and tell him that Dan, you know, we have a problem in this project.\n\nAnd somebody's going to file a claim against us for errors and omniscience. Some of the things which we always dread to go to your boss and tell him because he will be disappointed. How can you do this, Neil? On the contrary, Dan will be all enthusiastic. Okay, if that's the case, let's do this. Call such and such person.\n\nLet's make sure we do this enthusiasm in both cases I found very unique. He will not get upset because we have now a potential claim against us. But he will get all excited and say let's make sure that we are prepared to deal with it. I will never forget that. And it's now 20 years since I left the job. He now became the head of the entire organization which has 2100 people.\n\nThat shows what a person who can maintain his enthusiasm in all situations can achieve. In my own life, I've seen people achieving that. For one said that such a person, his intellect is steady. He does not get affected. His enthusiasm for acting in this world is not affected by the experience he is experiencing. So number one defined a role model.\n\nA man of perfect wisdom. So we come to the conclusion if we achieve that state, we got it made. We don't have to do anything after that. Bhagavan said, no, you have to be very careful. So then Bhagavan gives us a warning that be aware that your senses are very powerful. Indriyani Pramatini, Harati Prasabham Manaha.\n\nIt can take away the tranquility of mind. Because the very nature of senses is to go out and get impressions of all the objects. So what we know about objects is not really the actual nature of the object but what we have perceived about that object. That is the nature of senses. Those perceptions created on my mind. If my mind is not careful or it's not under the control of my intellect.\n\nThen it will get carried away again. And then it will lose its tranquility. So Bhagavan said, be careful. Therefore, a man of perfect wisdom moves around in this world like a tortoise that whenever it senses danger, it withdraws all its limbs. So man of perfect wisdom does not give up this world of plurality. He has to live in this world where he lives with his senses under control of his mind.\n\nSo mind is under the control of the intellect and senses are under the control of the mind. That is basically the state of a Perfect wisdom, Bhagavan Seta. So he moves around in that fashion. That is what we have seen in the last two verses. And it says everything starts from constant contemplation on sense object Visayan pansah. That is the root cause of all my troubles.\n\nWhen I constantly think about something, it becomes my nature. And once I attach myself to the world of finite objects, then now I'm going to assign my happiness to that object that I have now mortgaged. My happiness to the world of objects. And therefore now I have to acquire them because my happiness mortgage with them. Bhagawan said that is the ladder of fall. He started thinking about something that created attachment.\n\nThat attachment creates desires. The desires unfortunately creates anger. Anger created delusion. That delusion created loss of intellect. And loss of intellect gets you destroyed. So this is the fall which we have seen.\n\nSo that means I have to work with the root cause of my problem is Bhagavan Buddha in his Arya Satya. He says, the first Sathya is that Dukkha exists. There is Dukkha in this world. The second one is that there is a cause for Dukkha. And what is the cause for Dukkha? Desire is the cause for all Dukkha.\n\nSo Bhagavan says the same thing here. Dhyaya TOU visayyanpunsa. He is the cause for all the problems. So how do I live in this world? The next three verses actually describe how to get out of this danger. Falling from this ladder of fall.\n\nIt says Ragtayhi to visayan indriyesh charan atma vashehi vide prasadam adhigh. So countering that tendency of thinking about objects and then getting attached to them and then falling into that trap, he said, the man of wisdom who has now realized, as we were discussed last time, that attachment is a mental phenomenon or a mental concept. Because my mind gets impression from the world of objects, it gets attached. Detachment, on the other hand, is very intellectual pursuit. Knowing fully well that this attachment is going to create sorrows for me, I try to detach myself from those attachments. How do I detach myself?\n\nBhagawan says raga dwese vyuktaihi to one who is devoid of likes and dislikes, Bhagawan has given us pointer how to become that. He said Tani sarvani samyamya yukta asita matparaha. In verse 61 he said, Here is the key. You will not be able to control your senses unless you have a higher goal. Turn your mind towards the higher goals. If your higher goal is engaging your mind then the impressions coming out of this world is not going to affect it.\n\nIt will not disturb it. When we are engrossed in doing something we are not aware of what's happening around us. Yukta, Asita, Matparaha. Have me in your mind all the time. Now that again sounds really ridiculous. Goal to have that my mind is always focused on Bhagavan.\n\nTherefore I cannot think of anything else. No, actually once you realize that then nothing exists other than me. Everything you see, you should see me. Once I see all the objects are nothing but manifestations of the God. The impression of that object on my mind will be more divine than a finite image of that object. If you start seeing me in all things and beings then you will be able to control your mind.\n\nIf I see Bhagavan all supreme being, all things and being then question of likes and dislikes really does not come. I cannot have one part of Bhagavan I don't like. Another part of Bhagavan I like. That's truly not possible. We like everything about that person. Even his shortcomings we enjoy his shortcoming.\n\nBut person we don't like. Even his good qualities we don't enjoy. So once we identify with that supreme self, all his manifestations we will enjoy them all as they are. Because we will not have any judgment about an individual manifestation. So Bhagavan says Sachapa Raga, Dwese Viuktahi. Person who has become devoid of likes and dislikes.\n\nVisayan Indre Charan. He moves around in this world of objects. Because there is no escape from this world of objects. We are part of this world and we have to live in this world. What do we want to achieve? We have to achieve within this world.\n\nBut how we act in this world is up to us. So I said one who is devoid of likes and dislikes. He is moving around with Atma Vashyahi, Vidhey Atma. He is self restrained. He is not getting carried away by one experience or the another. Vidheyatma, his self control.\n\nPrasadam Adhi Gachadhi. He achieves that final result. And as we have discussed Prasad many times before, we are used to word Prasad after every puja we have Prasad. That Prasad is always sweet. That because the fruits of all my good actions sweet results. Here the result is tranquility of Mind the mind because it's not getting any impression which is negative.\n\nNo matter what impression comes from outside it sees a divine impression and therefore it is in a state of tranquility that is the prasad that's my final reward. Then nothing can upset my mind. Bhagavan said such a person Prasadam Adhighti achieves that final tranquility of mind that no experience can disturb the tranquility of mind. So Bhagawan says get out of likes and dislikes, see mean everything and then your mind will be constantly focused on me. Prasade Sarva Dukkha nam haani Yashi upa Jayate this is where we started. I want to learn Bhagavad Gita because I need to get rid of all my Dukkhas.\n\nI want to get Bhagavan's Kupa because I want to get rid of all my sorrows and unhappiness. Bhagavan says there is a way to do it and it is not my doing, it is your doing. You have to do it yourself. When you control your mind, when you get out of likes and dislikes then you will get prasad of your own actions which with the tranquility of mind that tranquility of mind actually it removes the cause for all your sorrows. Bhagavan Buddha said there is a Dukkha and there is a cause for Dukkha and all you have to do is remove the cause for your Dukkha and then you achieve that Kaivalyam Prasadu Khanam. By this prasad all Dukkhas get destroyed.\n\nPrasanna Cheta sah asu Buddhi pari avatist and for the one who is of tranquil mind, Chitta here Chitta Ekagra is also Chitta Ekagrita Chitta Ekagrita as we have discussed when Chitta only reflects nothing but definitive only Chitta is a mirror which is reflecting all the impressions from outside.

      "reflection": "Take a few moments today to consider: What would change if you truly believed that your essential Self cannot be harmed?

That awareness itself is untouched by what it witnesses. This is the key insight of these verses.\n\nNotice the experiences of pleasure and pain that come to you today. Can you see them as contacts between your senses and sense objects—temporary, impermanent, coming and going like waves? Bear them with equanimity, knowing they will pass."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 2, Sankhya Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge. Bhagavan gave us a roadmap for our journey from ignorance about ourselves to the knowledge of the Supreme. So we have seen step by step. How can I come out of this ignorance about myself? I consider this body as me, this mind as me, this intellect as me. The idea such as I think, therefore I am, creates attachment to my mind and my intellect.\n\nAnd this body serves as my vehicle for all my experience in this world, which creates attachment to it. And therefore I consider death of this body is my death. I have not seen anybody coming back after he dies. Therefore I consider the death of this body is my death. So Bhagavan said, dehino asmin yatha de hay kaumaram yavanamjara tatha dehantra prapti diraha tatra namuhyati. Then you have seen changes in your life.\n\nYou have seen in your journey various states of existence. You existed as a child, as a youth, and also as an old man. Now he said, you're not confused by that, that does not delude you. These experiences which are different from each other has never confused you, who you are. You always consider, this is me. When I say I, it remains same no matter what state I was in, whether I was a child, a young man or an old man.\n\nBut once that did not confuse you. This also should not confuse you when you leave this body and take up another body. This is a hypothesis for us now because we do not have really any experience. But an idea was introduced to us of a reincarnation that this life is not only life. You lived many lives before where you created all your vasanas and tendencies. I have tendency to be artistic, somebody else's tendency to be athletic, and the other person is more intellectual.\n\nWhere all these tendencies are coming from? Bhagwan said these tendencies are because of your experiences in the past, before even you were born. And then he basically said that this journey is the one of inactivity. This journey is of activity. This journey you have to be active all your life. Then the question is how do I act in this world?\n\nBhagavan said, sukha du KE sami krutva laba la Bhav jaya Jayo Tatha Yudhaya Yudjistra that with a balanced mind you should act in this world. That's basically simple advice Bhagavan gave. Samatvam Yoga Uchate. Create balance in your mind in all the various experiences you're experiencing. And then you will be on your path to your destination. Your destination is to find perfect happiness.\n\nBhagawan said, you will find that if you act in this world with a balanced mind. Then my question is how do I keep a balanced mind with varied experiences in my life? And Bhagawan said, Yukta Asitha Matparaha. Keep an overarching goal which encompass everything. All your experiences and all your feelings and. And all your thoughts.\n\nThen you will be able to balance your mind. If an overarching goal, then that goal becomes the destination. The goal will be reflected in those experiences. So we have all experienced that when you are in love, when you are fixated with one object, then. Then you see that in everything. When you fall in love, you see that person.\n\nIn all other persons you see that must be her, that must be him. Because my mind is so overpowered by that goal that I see everything in that. When I become first time a father or mother in all children, I see my child. Then my first time become grandfather. I see my granddaughter and grandson in all children. Because whatever is taking over your mind, you will reflect that in all your experiences.\n\nIf your mind is focused on me, if I am your supreme goal, then I will be reflected in all your experiences. So everything I see, I will see his manifestation. Everything I hear, I will hear his voice, his flute in that sound. So everything will become divine. Experience may be anything, but now my mind will not assign any other value but a divine value to it. Bhagawan said, Yukta Asitha Matparaha but to become Yukta Asitha Bhagavan says Tani Sarvani Samyamya by controlling all your senses.\n\nVasehi Indriyani One who is controlling the senses. Tasya Prajna Pratishtita his wisdom is steady. What he's seeing is to be seen. When my wisdom is steady, my mind is balanced. What I'm seeing is the reality. If my wisdom is not steady, if I assign different things as different values then my wisdom is not steady.\n\nThe result of that would be that I Will not have any sukha. I will not be at peace. So last verse which we discussed says, Na asti Buddhi, a Yuktashya, One who has no overarching goal. Yukta, one who is identified with the supreme goal. My supreme goal is really having Sukha and no Dukkha is my supreme goal. That overarching goal in my life is to avoid Dukkha and have Sukkah only ultimate happiness.\n\nIf that's my overarching goal. That happens when you are identified with the supreme self. Bhagavan says, the one who is not identified with the supreme goal is Ayuktaha. He has no goal, so anything will become his goal. Whatever the experience I have, I'll be attached to it. And then I will not know where my happiness lies.\n\nIt is something like when I was in India or in Africa. There were only few choices. There were only like two or three choices. Kesar, Pista or Kajoodraks. When I go to Low Garden in Ahmedabad, they were very clear. Not really a big question mark.\n\nI come here and their Baskin Robbins has 31 flavors. Now how do I know which flavor is good? If I taste all 31 of them, then I come to conclusion which one I like. By the time I get to 31st flavor, I forget what the first flavor tastes like. I start all over again. So I really have no clue where my happiness lies.\n\nBecause every time I taste something, I think that's it. And then I say, but there are 30 other flavors. I need to try them also. Maybe there is one better than this. So Bhagawan said, one who is Ayuktaha who does not have this fixed goal of what he is trying to achieve. He will not have any Buddhi Na asti buddhi Ayuktasya.\n\nHe does not have wisdom what my goal is and where my happiness is. He also does not have any identification. His identification shifts from one goal to another. In one who is not identified with one goal, how can we have any peace? Because he agitated in his mind. Even when I'm achieving something, I think this may not be it.\n\nThere may be other things which other people are getting. And I'm not getting it. I should be going after them. I may be missing out something because of this coronavirus. People may be out there doing something. So Bhagawan said, Nacha abhaveda Santihi.\n\nOne who does not have the identification with his go. He does not ashanti and asantasya kuta Sukham. The one who is agitated wherever is happiness for him. We all know this that when mind is agitated there is no sukkah. Sukkah I only experience when there is no thought in my mind. Swamiji used to say I minus I want is happiness.\n\nAs long as there is I want, there cannot be any happiness. As long as I want there cannot be any peace in mind. Because there's agitation, I don't have it. I must be doing something which is not right. Or I may not be doing something which I should be doing now. Those things create asanti.\n\nSuch a person cannot have sukkham. If your goal is to get sukkah you need to quieten your mind. And then Bhagavan gives why it is very important that that you start with controlling your senses which we have seen. Dhyayato Visayan Punsaha. If I let my senses get impression of the sense objects then I keep thinking about them. Then I'll fall from the ladder.\n\nSo it says Indriyanam hi charatam yat mano anu vidhiyate. Is if my mind follows the wandering senses. Senses are involuntarily going out and getting impressions of the objects they are contacting. If I keep my eyes open and see outside the window there will be impression of what's outside of the window. But what I will see will depend on the disposition of my mind. I see my friend Omi Narayan every day.\n\nHe puts one picture of a bird or a flower or something on his Facebook post. Now when I see outside, I see buildings. I say, well that guy's house looks a little better. I think it could have been designed a little better than this. So this position of my mind is to say built world, not natural world. So the senses are involuntarily going out there and getting impressions of these sense objects outside.\n\nIt is the mind which creates impressions. It says Indriyanamhi Charatam. These wandering senses. The mind follows these wandering senses. In other words, getting attached to each object it sees and wants to keep thinking about it. Tadasya Harati Pragnam.\n\nNow obviously he does not have wisdom of what is right and what is wrong for him. What to accept and what to reject. So the picture is worth thousand words. So Bhagavan gives this picture that just as a boat on the waters. If there is no controller, there is no boatman and it just boat by itself. It will be Tossed by the wind.\n\nWherever wind takes it, it will go. There is no fixed destination. If your mind follows every object which is perceived through the senses, then it will be tossed from one object to another. It does not have a goal and therefore it does not have any destination. My destination was happiness, but I lost my way because I have not fixed my destiny. I do not know where to go.\n\nI am just driving, but do not know where I am going. And then Bhagavan says, tasmad Yasya Mahabha. And therefore, oh Mahabha, oh mighty arm. Bhagawan gives Arjuna a little boost of courage that you are capable of doing so, of controlling your senses. Nigru hitani sarvasah Indriyani indriyarthebhya. Therefore one who has control all his senses from the sense objects, Tasya prajna pratishvita, his wisdom is steady.\n\nThis is very difficult verse to understand because we think it is impossible, impossible to not have any perception of this world outside. The very job of senses is to perceive world outside. If my mind is completely inert and is not getting any impression, then I'll be basically a dead person. Swamiji says, if that's the case, if you're not perceiving anything, just let us know and we'll do your last rites. So you're a dead person. If that's the case, it is not possible for us to do that.\n\nThe very nature of senses is to get impressions in the very nature of mind is to get attached to those impressions. But what I will see as my mind depends on the disposition of my mind. If I have already fixed a goal that my goal is to have ultimate happiness and therefore I have to fix my mind on the ultimate self, then I will see the manifestation of that self in everything which I hear, I taste, I touch. So the people who are bhakta, when they listen to music, they see Krishna Bhakti in it. To them the music is for achieving God's Bhakti. Otherwise I sing film songs and it has different emotions in it.",

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 2, Sankhya Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge. And we are coming to the end of chapter two and we will be discussing last three verses today and then we'll move on to Karma Yoga, Yoga of Action. So what we have learned so far in chapter two, which happens to be the whole summary of Bhagavad Gita. So all the ideas and the basic philosophy of Bhagavad Gita is summarized in chapter 2, first section of about 10 verses. The most important verse was verse 7 where Arjuna said, karpanya dosho aphatva Bavah that my nature is tainted, is overwhelmed by the taint of beauty, and I do not know what is right and wrong for me. I don't know what is my Dharma.\n\nDharma Asammuda Cheta Saha. My Buddhi does not tell me right now what is my right Dharma at this time. This is Shishya te Ahm. So he admits that I need guidance. I need someone to tell me what is right. Therefore tell me so Nishitam.\n\nWithout any wavering, tell me what is right for me. So the first section gives us our condition sometimes in life that we are completely overwhelmed by the situation and we cannot see what is right and wrong for us. But where we differ from Arjuna is still our ego doesn't give us that humility to say, I'm completely confused, I am your student. Give me guidance from someone who we think can give us guidance. Even at the point of confusion and delusion, we try to hang on to our ego and try to solve our problems ourselves. And therefore we can't see how to get out of this problem.\n\nBecause we are in the problem, we need to surrender to someone who can see it from outside and have complete faith in his advice and guidance and say, I'm going to follow whatever you tell me, just tell me. Because I can figure out right now what we typically do is we still carry our ego to whoever we are seeking advice from. Then say, look, Kodan well, okay. But what does he know? My problem only I know. That's why we fail to get the benefit of an advice.\n\nSo Bhagavan did not say anything in chapter one because he didn't see that he's ready yet. Swamiji says, even giving advice to a wrong person, wrong time can give more harm than help. Somebody is not ready to take the advice and you come and say, let me tell you, my son. He has to be ready before I can tell him what is right for him. So the first thing we have seen is at the time when you reach a point of complete confusion in your life you have to surrender. And in this case, if nothing else, surrender to my own conscience which is Bhagavan and say, give me guidance.\n\nYou tell me I don't know. My intellect cannot come to the conclusion what is right or wrong. And then obviously we have seen all the guidance Bhagavan gave. So he first changes his paradigm of what he thinks he was. You are not who you think you are. This limited being which you have considered yourself to be you, is not really you.\n\nThis is just your equipment. This body, mind and intellect which currently I consider it to be me, is actually nothing but my equipment. So if I can realize that this is something which is mine and cannot be me then I will be able to realize who I am and then able to get the benefit of that wisdom which comes to me. So Bhagavan has changed his paradigm and said, you are that imperishable being. And then we have seen the explanation of just as you change their clothes, you will change the body as well. But you remain the same.\n\nJust as you change from the childhood to the youth to the old age, from this life you'll move on to the next life. The advice given by Bhagavan is how to live life. Sukhadu khe samay kritva laba labava jayajayo yudhaya yujyaswa naivam papam avapsya sri in verse 38. So here is how you should live your life. Not a life of inaction, not a life of complete detachment from your duties but complete detachment from what's happening. What I'm experiencing, completely having that understanding that all things are transitory.\n\nThey are finite in nature and time space. So sukha du khasame krutva. You remain same, not that sukha dukha. I'll experience the same way. One will be pleasurable, one will be not pleasurable, will be painful. But I enjoy the pleasurable Experience and where the painful experience both time keeping in mind that this is just a passing phase in a finite experience.\n\nHow I keep my balance Victory and defeat in our life, we obviously constantly winning and losing. We're winning an argument, we are winning a negotiation, we are losing a deal. Marketing people teach you that everyone is selling something. You may not consider yourself a salesman, but you are selling something to somebody, selling your idea to your spouse, which vacation to take. You have to sell your idea first. So you're constantly selling and marketing and winning and losing in life, and you keep your balance.\n\nJust as you don't really get upset when you lose your argument, sometimes we do, but you're not supposed to because you understand still we are one family. The same way when I lose or win in outside in the world, I I should have the same equanimity. They're going to win sometime. The law of probability tells me I cannot have 100% success. As I told you, in our industry we'll say, what is the hit rate, how many proposals are submitted and how many have won. Now that hit rate is not really dependent on you, obviously, but it's just a law of probabilities, not which one I'm going to win.\n\nI know if I submit 10 proposals, I'll win at least one of them. It is a law of probability. So I have to be prepared for nine times, ready to be disappointed that somebody else was better than me. But one time when I win, I'm so ecstatic, I am the best. Another nine times, I will be miserable. Say no, no, you have to be same in all 10 times.\n\nBhagwan said, the operative word is you just engage in this battle of life. He can't run away from the battle of this life. And he's a guarantee you will not incur any sin in doing your duty with this attitude, no matter what you think the outcome is, but you are not incurring any wrong impressions on your mind. And then the last section we have seen is the Sthita Prajna. In the end, Arjuna said, if someone achieves this, how do I recognize him? So the verse 55 gives a short definition and it says prajahati yada kaman sarvant partamanogatamani eva atmana tustaha titapragna tat uchate?\n\nHow do I become that person who is in a blissful mood all the time? Because you are saying yidha yi jaswa, you want me to engage in the activity. Typically what we say, this is Too painful an environment. I need to leave this environment. Bhagwan said no, no, you can't leave. It's part of your duty.\n\nYou have to engage yourself in this battle of life and still remain equanimous, stable, blissful. How he said Prajahati yada kamagatan sarva. He didn't say to give up all the desires. Desires cannot go away completely. Mr. Manogadhan fabricated by my mind something which I really don't need. But I think I have to have it.\n\nThe one thing I learnt in all this training we go through in corporate world, one of the training I had done was negotiate to win. They have an exercise of Honest Abdullah's shop in Pakistan and you are an American tourist and you're going to go and negotiate this antique piece or some curious. It's the first thing. And what the American does is he says oh that's great, I got to have it. Once Zillah hears I got to have it, he knows he got you and then he's going to start from the highest what he can imagine. Then he will just come back slightly lower.\n\nAnd you think you have done it. If you're from India, what do you do? Well, I really don't need it. But I think you know I'm here. Meena and I went to India last time and we were. I think I don't know where we were.\n\nBut anyway we were in one of this historical place and she said I can buy it but I don't really have space for this in my bag so I can't really buy it. But if you give it to me for this price, I'll buy it. The guy said, so if I give you the lower price you'll have space in your bag. She said no, I can only buy okay, I don't have space in my bag. So we worked the other way around. I really don't need it.\n\nBut if you want to give me so this is mano gatan by my mind I have fabricated desires. And then I'm going to say I got to have it or if I have it, fine, if I give up all the desires which are fabricated by my mind, not my needs. I have desire to fulfill my needs. I'm thirsty and I want glass of water is one thing. But if I have to buy a Perrier just because it's a status symbol, well that's my Manogatan desires. So Bhagavan said that if you give up all the Manogatan Desire and just be happy with whatever you come across.\n\nAtmani evaatmana tustaha. Fulfilling my desire is not giving me happiness or joy. It just fulfilling my needs. But I am always satisfied by myself. Who I am and where I am. Atmaniyevna tastha titapragna tad uchate.\n\nThat is the definition of Sthita pragna. Not that he is not working in this world or he is a sanyasi, he is in Himalaya. But he is satisfied in himself where he is. He is not getting jealous by reading Forbes magazine. And so all these people are making all this money and what am I doing here? So when I am not disturbed by the outside world and that outside world can create the unnecessary desires in my mind.\n\nI am a Sthita Pragma Bhagavan sahib. So then we have gone through the whole characteristics of Tita Pragna. That he works in this world in a very intelligent way. That's an intelligent way of living. He does not live life in a chaotic way. Where we live life is somewhat just prompted by our instincts.\n\nGo to the mall and have no plan to buy X, Y or Z. But just because I'm there and look at it, I keep saying maybe I need that and maybe I should have that because it's on sale. That's because I never had really defined what will make me happy. So he said the Sthita prana. What he does, he lives an intelligent life and say he does not expose himself to those temptations. As soon as he sees there are temptations, he withdraws his senses.\n\nSo he's always protect himself from getting undue impressions which are not necessary. And that's how we live an intelligent life. Where he can maintain his state of equanimity. And then the last four verses now tells us the difference between us and him. Right now I'm completely aware of my world. And there are myriads of objects in this world.\n\nAnd I'm seeking happiness in that. Constantly I'm planning how can I get happiness?",
      "reflection": "Take a few moments today to consider: What would change if you truly believed that your essential Self cannot be harmed? Not as a comforting platitude, but as a lived reality?\n\nWhen fear arises today, experiment with asking: 'What is it that's aware of this fear?' That awareness itself is untouched by what it witnesses. This is the key insight of these verses.\n\nNotice the experiences of pleasure and pain that come to you today. Can you see them as contacts between your senses and sense objects—temporary, impermanent, coming and going like waves? Bear them with equanimity, knowing they will pass."

      "commentary": "We have completed chapter two, Sankhya Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge, in which we have seen that in the beginning Arjuna was confused about his duties. He wanted to act according to his Dharma, but he wasn't sure what is his Dharma. So he argued first that maybe I should not take part in this war because I don't want to be the cause for all the consequences of this bad war. And then obviously he put for all his arguments, seeking endorsement from Krishna, that yeah, that's the right thing to do, let's stop this war. You run away and we'll be fine. Well, Krishna did not endorse his ideas and actually asked him to do his duties as the commander of the army, the Kshatriya.\n\nThe prince is given this task and then to explain to him why this is, he gave him a true thumbnail picture of who we are and how you should look at the world. So in the beginning he told him about what the self is, that this self is immutable, imperishable, only the body dies, and therefore you should not grieve about anybody dying. And then he continued telling him why he should continue his duty in this world. But then Arjuna asked, is there any person who can be such established in this knowledge that he is equanimous? In the end we have seen that a man of a steady wisdom, how he lives his life in a very intelligent way, that he does not get affected by all the attractions of this objective world. So he always keeps his senses under control and remain equanimous mentally in all situations.\n\nAnd therefore Bhagavan said, you go ahead and act in this world, keeping your mind and intellect equanimous in all situations. Now this seems very simple and clear to us, but Arjuna, who was truly in that dilemma of what is right, I want to do my Dharma, but I don't know which one is right. This whole discourse about what the self is all about obviously did not make it very clear to Arjuna. So the chapter three, titled Karma Yoga, Yoga of Action, now elaborates upon what is action and how you should work in this world. You have to work in this world because we are all working. But if we find out how to act maybe we have a better results because we act in this world with mixed results.\n\nSometimes we are successful, most of the time we are not. Most of the time the results come completely contrary to what we think we should be getting out of our actions. So this chapter teaches us how to act in this world so our actions can be very effective. So the karma becomes Karma Yoga. Therefore this chapter is very very popular. Some of the great commentators have said the Gita is all about Karma Yoga.\n\nIt teaches you how to act in this life one way or other. It is a very important chapter for all of us because all of us are trying to figure out how to work in this world because we will not be able to avoid working in this world, this world. So the chapter opened with Arjuna's question just as we all have. We all ask this question say yeah this is great. In the Gita class we talk about all this, you know, desirelessness and actionlessness and go back to your workplace on Monday morning and try to tell that to your client. From our perspective it does not work.\n\nI actually just heard Mina watches all those this course in the morning so I get the benefit. When I'm passing around I overhear stuff Deepak bhai from Dada Bhagavan and they have a question answer format. So somebody ask and say Deepak bhai when I am trying to focus more on this Prateekraman and all that and spirituality I lose my motivation to make progress in my job. Should I focus more on this or focus more on my job? The bag bhai said so what's your name sir? My name is Janakbhai.\n\nJanakbhai, let Janakbha make the progress in the job and you establish yourself into spirituality. In other words you need to separate yourself from what's happening in this world with you. You become a saxhicaitanya. Basically when you take a role of a Janakbha as an employee you have to work as an employee very effectively. When Janakbhai is in a spirituality Janakbhai has to establish in the spirituality. So the answer is not very clear so that Janakbhai can say Deepak bhai tell me one thing, you are not helping me here.\n\nJanakbhai is one and you are telling me to be two different Janakbai So this is not Janakbhai's newly minted question. This question Arjuna had 5,000 years ago. So he said, Jayasi Chit Karmanaste Mata Buddhi Janardina Tatkim Karmani Ghore Maam Niyo Jayasi Keshava. You just discussed in detail what is right and what is wrong, what is better and what is not so good, what is higher and what is lower. In last chapter he says Durena hi Avaram Karmaha Buddhi Yoga Dhananjaya. Krishna in last verse clearly says that Karma is inferior to Buddhi Yoga.\n\nIn the beginning he propagated, you should go and fight for all these good reasons. Then he come back and said, you achieve the Buddhi Yoga. Buddhi yoga knowledge about what is your true self. Arjuna said, that's what I was trying to do. I want to run away and meditate. If you consider that Buddhi is better than Karma, you say it very clearly.\n\nIn last chapter in verse 49, the Durenahiyavaram Karmaha Buddhi Yoga Dhananjaya. So therefore you said engage yourself in a Buddhi Yoga. You clearly told me that Tatkim Karmani Ghore mam. Then why are you asking me to fight this war? This, this is like person interested in physics wants to find out what light is all about. If I ask a Mahatma like Sid Carey who is a physicist, tell me sir, what is light?\n\nAnd he said, light can be a particle or a wave. I said, what do you mean? Is it a particle or a wave? Please don't confuse me. He said, no, both are right. Except that you have to rise yourself to a level in your understanding to understand both viewpoints.\n\nHe said it depends on the observer. Observer can decide it's a particle or it's a wave. So Bhagavan said, karma is necessary, but Buddhi Yoga is also necessary. One is superior than other depending on where you are. Vya Mishrena Vakhena Buddhim Moha Yasi Evame. This mixed Mishrena you are going the two mixed messages.\n\nYou are speaking from both sides of your mouth. One side saying go fight the war, that's okay, kill those people. Other side says, establish yourself in Buddha knowledge. This is confusing my intellect. This statements have already confused my intellect. Tad Ekam Vadanishchtya.\n\nTherefore obviously I am your Srishya. I already told you I am your Shishya. You tell me what is good for me. So don't go into this great arguments about which one is better. Tell me one thing that will be the best for me which will be Shreyas which is good for me. As you are saying shres and prayers.\n\nSomething which is pleasant but may not be good for me but something you tell me. It may not be pleasant but tell me this is good for you. And I already told you, I surrender to you. I will do whatever you tell me. And then comes the whole chapter 3 karma yoga bhagavan said Sri Bhagavanu Vacha Now Bhagavan is elaborating in what Karma is all about. Loke Asmin d Vidha Nistha Pura Prukta Maya Anaga don't get confused.\n\nThere is not only one path in this world. Loki Asm in this world. Dvivida Nishta I have established two paths. Because you need to give people alternates. You have to have choice. Pura Prokta Mayan Right from the beginning I established two paths.\n\nThis is the first time as lots of commentators say. Bhagavan comes out clearly and said I'm not Vasudeva Krishna. I am the Supreme Lord. That right from the beginning of this world I established two paths. So you always had two options available from the day one. The day I forgot myself as who I am.\n\nFrom the day I forgot that I am the Supreme Being and taken up this identity as me, this limited being, I had two paths available. Loki Asmin Dyudanista My loka started when the very first thought that I am who I am, this limited being. And Bhagawan says there are always two paths available. It is like I'm going to New York. My goal is to reach New York and just around the Delaware where it has two paths. One goes to New Jersey Turnpike, another 95 going through Philadelphia and all that.\n\nI get confused and say which way I'm going. Well, I have two paths available. I can go through the 95 and I still reach New York. And I can go through New Jersey Turnpike and I'll still reach New York. So Tupa is always available to me. Gnana Yogina Sankhyana for those who are established in contemplation, those who are contemplative type.\n\nFor them Gnana Yoga Yoga of Knowledge, Karma Yogi and a yoginand. Those who are action oriented. For them Karma is established. Two paths are available to us. Either you have to work through your way to your goal or realize how to get there quickly. If I realize the New Jersey Turnpike will be quicker and I'll take quicker path.\n\nIf not, I'll work through my way through 95, going through the smaller town, all of that and traffic then reaching both will lead me. There is also something similar to. In our Indian system of marriage, okay. In Indian system, I say, well, if you want to get married, you have two parts. I'm not sure what is there now. Either you can have love marriage.\n\nYou fall in love, find somebody and then get married. Or arrange marriage, find somebody, get married and then fall in love. Both ultimately culminating into what? One starts out by knowing first who I want to marry. Knowledge occurs to me that one I like and then I get married. But then I work towards how to live together, what marriage is all about.\n\nAll that takes place after Meena said, I never knew you're this swaroopa till I got married. Even though we were dating for three years. On the other hand, you get married to somebody, you work through an arranged marriage. Then you have to fall in love with her. Ultimate goal is what is to identify. Right now my identification is with this limited self.\n\nMy goal is to identify with the supreme self. So identification has to change. When occurs, it becomes love. When I start identifying, then only I can love somebody. I cannot love someone I never met. So I have to first know someone to fall in love with her.\n\nIn Swamiji, always you fall in love, you rise in devotion. So to love someone, you have to know the person. So to love the divine, you have to know the divine, that bhakti. Eventually you're trying to achieve the Bhakti Yoga. That's your goal, to have devotion for the Lord. But I cannot devote to somebody whom I do not know.\n\nI love God, but I don't know who. That is not possible. So I have two paths to achieve that devotion. When I get the knowledge that who I am, that I am not this limited self, contemplating on who I am not, and I get the knowledge who I am, then I'll identify with that self.",
      "reflection": "Choose one action today—any action—and practice doing it with full attention but without attachment to results. Whether it's sending an email, having a conversation, or completing a task, offer it as best you can and then release your grip on the outcome.\n\nNotice what happens when you work this way. Is there more freedom? More presence? More energy? The Gita's teaching of Karma Yoga isn't about becoming passive or indifferent. It's about working with full engagement while remaining internally free.\n\nAsk yourself: Where in my life am I most attached to results? What would change if I could offer my best effort and then surrender the outcome?"

When I get the knowledge that who I am, that I am not this limited self, contemplating on who I am not, and I get the knowledge who I am, then I'll identify with that self.",

      "commentary": "So far we have seen that in the dilemma of whether to work in this world or renounce actions. We have discussed many times in this discussion that the action which is an interaction between I and this world creates impression. This impressions on my mind creates tendencies, these tendencies create desires, the desires create actions. And then cycle starts all over again. More I act, more I'll interact with this world. That interaction will have this cause and effect relationship.\n\nThis cycle seems like never ending cycle that I can never get out of this. And the whole purpose of all this studies is to get out of this cycle. So obviously Arjuna is confused whether he should act by fighting this war or renounce all these actions and go to Himalaya. So that's where we started the chapter and last verse. We have seen Bhagavan Singh Niyatam Kuru Karmatwam Very firm prescription. You must do all your ordained duties.\n\nNiyatam Kuru Karmatvam Karma Jayahi Akarma Naha Because Karma is superior than inaction. Action is superior than inaction. So very simple, very clear that what you should do in life is do your ordained duties. And, and we have seen in last discussion, the ordained duties are. Daily duties which we can't really escape. Brushing your teeth, taking bath, going to work, all these Nitya Karma, there's nothing special about it.\n\nNobody is going to congratulate you every morning for brushing your teeth unless you are a little three year old child. Then Naymithya Karma which are the special duties, when something required by your family, your community, your society, your nation, then you have to perform those duties. You're not doing those duties every day. On special occasions you're required to participate. Either you have voluntary army or a draft. If you're not volunteering on your own to protect your country, there will be a draft.\n\nYou have to draft you because that's required a special duty. So Bhagavan says Niyyatam Kuro Karma tum. Then Niyata Karma includes both the Nitya and Nainitya that means there is no escape from any duty. Swamiji, give example that your friend is sick and he needs your help. That time you can say I am very busy. You can, but that means you are shirking your duty.\n\nYou are not doing your part. So Bhagawan very clearly says Nidham Kuru Karma Thomas Karma Jyay or Karmanaha Karma is anytime better than inaction. Action is anytime better than inaction. Sari Yatra Apicha Tena prasiddayat or Karmanah. By inaction you can't even sustain your body. We can understand that even to sustain my body, I have to act.\n\nAnd therefore action is prescribed here. So now we are still in the conundrum. On one hand we want to liberate ourselves from this bondage and other hand we have to act. So it looks like catch 22. So the next four verses, as Swamiji says, are laid out as the overall scheme of thing as the Creator has created how to act and how to be liberated from your actions, not bound by your actions. Also, when this world is created, there should be a plan for sustaining it.\n\nSo the whole plan is laid out in the next few verses. And I obviously had been listening to Swamiji from the Cold War era. And Swamiji used to say, don't blame me or don't put me in jail because it sound like I'm a communist or a socialist. The Krishna who is socialist, not me. Where Krishna now lays out the whole path of socialism in the next four verses, Swamiji says, there is no real social nation on this planet because everybody is. Even though communist countries, there are people who are just for their power.\n\nThat's not what the socialism is all about. So the next four verses lay out the whole plan of sustaining this universe and you being a part of that universe. How you can participate but not get bound by your actions. So the next verse says, Yajnar Thaat Karmano anyatra Loko Ayam Karma Bandanaha. Actions other than those performed for the Yajna are binding Loko yam in this loka in this world. This Loka is bound by Kun, cause and effect.\n\nEverything in this world is bound by cause and effect. There is nothing in this world is free from cause and effect. Therefore, we give this standard example. If I see something in this room, it's an effect. If I see a table in this room, it's an effect. And I cannot say that this table has no cause.\n\nWhere did this table come? Kneel and say, we are chinma mission, we don't want to do anything. And table appears here. Obviously nobody will believe me because you know I bought it from somewhere. Even if I didn't buy it, I stole it from somebody. So buy, borrow or steal.\n\nOnly three ways we can acquire things. Table is in effect, so it must have a cause. This cause has two aspects, efficient cause and a material cause. Someone who knew how to make this table is the efficient cause carpenter and the material cause, the wood which was required. So having this relationship of cause and effect, this table comes into existence. So in this loca everything is bound by cause and effect.\n\nSo if you act, there will be an effect. So you will be bound by this cause and effect. If you are acting for your own desires, for your own betterment, for your own good only. But if you are working for the betterment of the whole society, for the cosmic order, then you are bound by one thing. So yajna karmano van Yatra, actions performed for the Yajna. Obviously we know culturally that it's a ritual of offering sacrifices in the fire.\n\nBut the original meaning, the significance of Yajna in Vedic period was to propitiate the deities who are in charge of this elemental forces. As a observant person, we realize that there are two aspects of my success. One is my own efforts, but then also the environment in which I'm putting my efforts. I may be very hard working farmer where if there is no rain, obviously I will not have any success. So I know that something other than me is participating in my success. So that's we call it Devam.\n\nThat's something destiny we call it. So these phenomenal forces are the ones I don't have control over. One year there is a lot of rain, the other year there is a drought and third year there is just appropriate rain. How do I control that? There must be some controller who decides this. That controller we call deva.\n\nMaybe there is a controller who controls this rain, a deva. So if we appease those devas, it will be good for the whole society and there will be rain for the whole society. This yajnas were the cooperative endeavor to appease the deities of phenomenal forces. So the purpose was to have a common good where everyone can benefit in the community. Therefore you hear the story about in Bhagavad, Krishna lifting the govardhan parvat. You know how it all started.\n\nKrishna was a reformer. Everybody was doing yajna to Indra. Krishna said, why are you Offering this Yajna to Indra. Indra is not doing anything for you. These cows are doing supporting you. This Mother Earth is supporting.\n\nLet's have Yajna for the cows and lay Yajna for the earth. That's from Mother Earth. Mother Cow, they are supporting us, not Indra. So Indra got mad and then the whole story goes he sent all the storms and hurricanes and typhoons or whatever. And then Krishna protects them under the Govardhan Parvat. Even though he was holding it, everyone else was supporting it with their sticks.\n\nAnd then in the end what do we have? Because of the rain, there's so much food that when all the rains subsided, everybody said let's have a party. Everybody brought their own food. So there was Annakut. There was like the mountain of food. So if you think that Patlak was started in America, Krishna started Patlak from that Govardhan Parvat there.\n\nSo the whole idea is that we have a capacity to work together for the common good. When we work together for common good that include my good also. But not just my good, but everyone else's good as well. Those actions are considered Yajna actions. Bhagavan says all the actions performed in that spirit are not binding. You may be acting in your profession but if you're only acting for the salary then that's a self esteem.\n\nBut reacting because you are improving the other people's lives. By participating as a doctor, as engineer, you're making the society better and making everyone's life easier. It's a Yajna actions. Actions performed in the spirit of Yajna are non binding. All others are binding. So here is your escape hatch.\n\nYou can continue doing whatever you are doing. Just change the attitude that I'm not doing it for myself, I'm doing it for the greater good. Whether I'm an architect, a doctor, a housewife, a mother, everything I'm doing is not just for me but for the overall good of the society, the community, the cosmos, the universe. So Yajna Karmano Anyatna Loko Yam Karma Bandanah Tadartam Karma Kantaya Mukta Sangha Samacharah. Therefore here is the clear advice. Perform actions in the Yajna spirit for Yajna without any attachment.\n\nPerform your actions. Nothing you have to change in your life. Purely your attitude towards your actions. I'm doing these actions because it will help the Entire society. Therefore we have this now new awareness about green buildings, green society, energy savings. Nothing new we had in our culture.\n\nTherefore when I go for my presentations on this green initiative, I say well, I never had to learn because it comes from my culture. We respected the mother earth, we respected nature because we understood those Vedic people understood the value of nature and our participation. Therefore Bhagavan says Tadartam Karma Kaunteya Tadhartam for the Yajna. That Yajna therefore act for Yajna only Mukta Sangha without attachment. Not having the attachment that I am the doer. I am the only one who can do this.\n\nBecause you are just a part of the whole society. You are not an island by yourself. By yourself you are worthy of doing nothing. Just simple act of me coming to this class, I cannot do by myself. So many people have to do so many things. Police have to make sure that there are no crimes on the road.\n\nRoads are clear, the traffic is properly regulated. BMW has to make a car so I can drive a car. Gas companies have to put the gas in the gas stations. All that when it all come together, I can make the simple move from my house to within center if I recognize that. Bhagavan said you are Mukta Sangha. You are detached from your actions.\n\nSahayagnaha Prajaha Srishtva Purow vacha Prajapati. So how all this Bhagavan says started creator when he created this universe, he knew that he has to sustain it. So how are we going to. If we create something and we do not know how to sustain, we start a business. But you know how to sustain the business. If you start any endeavor or create any creation, you have to make sure you maintain it, you sustain it.\n\nSo you have to have a plan for that. You have painting artists create. You have to have a plan for how you are going to protect it, where you are going to display it, how to preserve it. So there is always a plan for sustaining something when you create it. Therefore, in Hindu trinity there is a creator, a sustainer and a destroyer.",

      "commentary": "So we are now discussing chapter three. Karma Yoga, Yoga of action. We typically evaluate before getting into any sphere of activity. What are my limitations? If I want to take a particular major in the university? Am I good at mathematics or I'm good at science or arts?\n\nOnce I decide what my limitations are, then I say how I can develop my capabilities in that field. And then that becomes the field of my choice. So in Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavan in chapter two, give us our limitations. That Karmaniyeva adhikarahte ma faleshukajana. Our limitation is to act in the present only. And we have no control over the fruits.\n\nSo that's our limitation Bhagavan has given us. Therefore, Bhagavan said that do not worry about the fruits. They are not in your capabilities. You never get attached to inactivity. You focus on your actions. And then for development of my capabilities, then Bhagavan said, Yogastha Guru Karmani, establish yourself.\n\nYoga is nothing but the balance of mind, equanimity of mind. So once you know your limitations that I have no control over the fruits, but I do have control over my actions, then I have to now become more efficient in my action. And therefore Bhagavan said that Yoga Isthaha. Establish yourself in Yoga, you guys. Develop balance of your mind while acting. When your mind is imbalanced, there is no way you can act efficiently.\n\nSo once you establish the equanimity of your mind, then Yoga, Karma, Sukhaoshalam, that will be the result. You will become very efficient in your actions. You will be very dexterous in your actions if you can balance your mind. So your job is only to balance your mind no matter what the situation is. Because you will be acting in this world in myriads of situations. Situations are not in your control.\n\nThey will be controlled by the world of phenomena, the world outside the people of the world. You have no control over that. But you have to continuously act. Because you cannot stay without any activity. You cannot Change the situation. But you can change the way you perceive and work in this activity.\n\nIn one of these TV serials I heard a very interesting line. If you cannot change the Paristhidi then change your Manasthiti. And I thought it's very profound statement. If you can change the circumstances outside, you can at least change your mental reaction to it. Manasthiti, the state of your mind you can change because you cannot change the situation outside. The Bhagavan said Samatvam Yoga Ucha de balance of mind in all situations.\n\nNow that I have learned how to work efficiently, I need to know what is the field of my activity and what spirit I should be acting. So the last verse we have discussed is Yajnarthaat Karmano Anyatra Loko Yam Karmabandana Tad Artam Karma Kohantea Yajnaartha Karma Kauntiya. So Bhagawan has now given us the field of activity that Yajna is the field of your activity. And we have defined Yajna as cooperative activity for the greater good. Dedicated action sacrifice. So Yajna is basically people come together in a spirit of sacrifice.\n\nEach one sacrifice something of his own for the betterment of the community. So Bhagavan said, that's the field and the spirit. If you act with all the capabilities you have developed by that samatvam employed in Yajna Yajna Lokoyam Karma Bandanaham Actions performed other than for Yajna are binding. We know that action is bound by its own reaction. By law of physics Newton taught us in high school at least that action and reaction are equal and opposite. Anytime there is an action, there will be reaction.\n\nSo the action is bound by the law of Karma. My actions are bound by law of actions. So I'm bound by the result of my action. Once I perform action, I have no control over the result. And as the actor I will be affected by the result. So my action will have a reaction from the world.\n\nThat reaction is now the effect of the cause which was my action. Now the reaction from the world when I react to becomes another cause for the reaction by the world. So that chain starts the chain of cause and effect. Once I start the chain, I will be the only one who can break is I who can stop that chain by not reacting to the reaction of my action. So if I do not react to the fruit of my action then I'll be able to break that chain of that action which I started. Therefore, Bhagawan said Yajna onyatra lokuam Karma, bandana, action which I'm performing for gaining something benefiting from my action are all binding.\n\nAll actions are binding. But if I am performing action not for me but for the greater good then I'm not really expecting anything particularly for me and therefore there is no reaction from me and I'll stop that chain reaction. That's why Bhagavan said the karmas performed in Yajna are non binding to you as a person. Those karmas will be binding to the community for which you have performed that Yajna. Those karmas will be binding to the group of people benefit from those actions but not you personally. So Bhagawan says therefore Yajnaartaat Karma, Kauntiya, Mukta Sangha, Samacharah without attachment, now you attach yourself into it.\n\nThat I'm doing this so that the community will benefit. That will also benefit me. That attachment will again bind you. But if you are not attached to your actions in the first place and then to the results in the second place then you are completely free. So Mukta Sangha sam acharaha perform those actions. And then the next verse now says that this is the universal design.\n\nThis is not something Bhagavan said I came up with just to give you this advice. This is the original design, universal design, how this universe should function. The next verse says Saha Yagnaha, Prajaha, Srushtva, Pura uvacha. Prajapati said that I created Yajna and Prajaya at the same time. So Praja here is all beings. It is now narrowed down to human beings.\n\nBecause everything in this world other than human beings working in compliance with the laws of nature, everything is cooperating and complementing each other except when it comes to human beings. We have free will and we become the disruptors if we are not working in this spirit of Yajna. So Bhagawan said, when I created Praja, I also create a Yajna with it. There is a creative force in nature. That creative force is evolving things. And when it comes to a level of evolution that you can function on your own, Prajapati says, I have created Praja but I also created the spirit of Yajna with it.\n\nBy this you shall prosper. But I'm giving you means to support yourself, means to prosper yourself. This is your milch cow. This is your Kamadenu. And we obviously all know about the mythology of Kamadhenu the sacred cow which is capable of fulfilling all your desires. So in mythology the cow came out of churning of ocean and it is also described as a cow's body with human female head and bird's wings.\n\nSo it is basically combination of all beings. The this Kamadenu is all beings. The birds and animals and human beings all working together can fulfill any desire. In this case your Yajna is the Kamadenu. This cooperative spirit and the actions performed in Yajna are capable of giving you whatever you desire. When I created Praja, I created spirit of Yajna.\n\nWe know that everything in this world has has to be working together. And every one of us have to contribute our own share for the betterment of the community. So if I am living in Hendrico county and enjoying all the services Hendrico county offers, I have to contribute my part as paying taxes. If every citizen decides that I'm not going to pay my taxes, there won't be any services after a while. So Bhagavan said, you do your part, but if you work in this cooperative manner, you shall prosper. You will get anything you desire by this Yajna.\n\nAnd the next verse says Devan Bhavayat vanena te Deva Bhavayantu vaha parasparam Bhavayantaha Sreiyah param avapshata Bhagawan explains how it works. Cherish the Devas with this Yajna. You nurture Devas with your cooperative actions. Because your existence in this universe is not that of an island. You as an individual, as you consider is not really an individual. You're just part of the big whole.\n\nAnd in this universe everything is connected to everything. And therefore if each part is not working in a right manner, which we call it Dharma Chakra, if that's not working, then there cannot be any progress. There cannot be any evolution. Deva Bhavyatan, we have discussed Deva before. Deva etymologically means that which is shining. So you know in a vernacular language you have Dhyan deeper.\n\nSo Diva is that which is shining in human beings. Our senses are shining. Our senses illuminate the world outside. So these senses can only work if I nurture those senses. So for me, even the individual to function properly, I have to nurture my senses. Then the same senses will nurture me.\n\nDeva Bhavayantuvah, those Devas will then nurture you. You nurture Devas and Devas will nurture you in an individual level. If I take care of my senses, then my senses will nourish me. At the universal level, the phenomenal forces are considered devas. So in our mythological stories, The Devas are 33 Karod Devas or 33 Koti. The 33 great elements are the devas.\n\nSomewhere in comment Swamiji has listed those Devas, you know, 8 Vasus, 12 Rudras, etc. In other words, everything in this world is important. And unless every element of this universe is taken care of, the universe cannot function as it's supposed to be. Everything in the universe is working as per the laws of nature. The human beings have to be disciplined. And now in today's situation, we all know about the climate change, the green movement.\n\nWe know that world would have worked perfectly fine if we have not created the problem with the environment. Anytime I want to get something out of the environment, I have to make sure the environment is not affected. But which is where we are failing. I actually read a very interesting theory on Facebook or WhatsApp where the theory was that this coronavirus has come out because of 5G network. The presenter was so convincing and he relates all the coincidences saying when the electricity was invented, then we had this great flu and all the pandemics were related to the development in electricity and how we use the electricity. And the Latest is this 5G.\n\nAnd the Wuhan was the main center of that 5G. Now there may not be any basis in this theory, but one thing is entirely possible, that if we do not use the natural resources with understanding, then it can create disasters which we have not anticipated. The global warming, we are all now experiencing the results of them. So here Bhagawan said, you take care of the nature and nature will take care of you. How can I as an individual take care of the nature? Bhagavan said, if you act in the spirit of Yajna, that every action that you perform, if you analyze and see that it is for the greater good and not just for me.\n\nSo Ezra Plate says that will produce more than we consume, will give more than we take. If I have that attitude of Yajna, the sacrifice, I'm sacrificing my actions for the greater good. Because you are cherishing Devas and those Devas, those phenomenal forces will then cherish you, will nurture you.",

      "commentary": "So we are now discussing chapter three, Karma Yoga, Yoga of Action. We have seen so far, Raghavan says. Sa yagnaha prajaha srushtva pura uacha Prajapati an inna prasivaschiddam isha bah twastikamadhu. In the beginning, when the Prajapati created beings Praja, he also created Yajna. So we are right now concerned about Praja. Praja means human beings.\n\nSo the Lord of Praja is Prajapati. The one who propagates progeny is Prajapati. So from that perspective all parents are Prajapati. So we are Prajapati for our Praja, for our children. So what we do for our children is not that we have given them life or created their existence, but we also have to create sustenance for them. So what we do is we give them education.\n\nThen say this education will be your milch cow. Use this education to get whatever you want. Prajapati is mentioned in Hiranya Gharba Sukta in Dhruva. So the Rig Veda says that previously there was nothing but Hiranyagarbha. So Hiranya Garbha is something like the condition before the Big Bang. All the potentiality but no reality.\n\nSo there is a singularity or the potentiality but no reality. So that Hiranya Garbha then out of its own potential, its own creative urgent, creates a mind. This is also mentioned in Brihadaranya Upanishad and Chandogya Upanishad. Brihadaranyak Upanishad describes this Hirinyagarba. Thus he says, first there was nothing but death and hunger. So death means nothingness.\n\nThere is nothing, there is nothing to devour, nothing to enjoy by senses, because there are no senses, there is nothing. And then he creates mind out of his creative force. And with that mind he creates water. And then water create a fire, then whatever in the water solidifies and becomes earth. So basically the creation is explained from the beginning, when there was no creation from the no creation to creation and then a being is born in that and that's it. That being said let this body of mine be fit for a sacrifice.\n\nSo that's the creation of your prajapati. In our modern day scriptures we say brahma is the prajapati. Brahma is the creator is the prajapati. But here prajapati is very defined as the pati of praja the beings. See in our puranas we also have daksha prajapati. He is lord of all beings.\n\nIn daksha his father in law was a prajapati. So there are several versions of this word prajapati but basically here in this case it means the primordial being from which the praja came. And then obviously that being was also concerned how this praja will prosper for any family man his goal is to expand his family. So it actually says anayne prasivishadvam, may you propagate your progeny through this. May you multiply with this. We also can take it as may you grow with this.\n\nAnd then he said that this yajna which I have created is your milchka the sacrifice. That which I have created is the giver of all that you desire, all that you need. That's what Bhagavan started in saying. Sacrifice was created, Spirit of sacrifice was created at the same time the praja was created. The praja can only sustain itself by sacrifice. That basically was the intention of that verse.\n\nAnd it almost seems like that the whole idea comes from the Brihadaranya Upanishad. The same idea is also in Kathopani sadh. So basically there is a being who is the first created being. This will be similar to the christian theory of Adam being the first man. It says that ishtakamadhu for you this will be your milchka, the sacrifice. The spirit of sacrifice will be all that you need.\n\nAnd then from that you can get anything that you want. Uprisa also says prajapati has two types of sons. One are the devas and other asuras. Now even if we don't get into our Puranic and Vedic theories of our devas and asuras at our micro level the devas are our senses. And if I take care of my senses, my senses will take care of me. If I take care of my eyes, I will take care of my world of seeing.\n\nIf I take care of my ears, my ears will take care of my world, of my sound my world will be taken care of if I take care of my senses. So he said that you nourish the Devas and Devas will nourish you. At a global level or universal, we can say devas are the phenomenal forces, the nature. If I cherish nature, nature will cherish me. And probably it was difficult to understand this concept 100 years ago. But in today's time, with the global warming and all the concern about climate change, we can understand that if we as human beings don't take care of the climate, the environment, the environment will not be able to support us as a species on this planet.\n\nThe Bhagavan said that you nourish Devas and Devas will nourish you. With that cooperative relationship, thou shall prosper. Yagna sista asinah santah muchante sarvakilbishaihi. The good people, the righteous one, they eat the remnants of the Yajna. And by eating the remnants of the yajna they are freed from all sins. So as we have seen that the idea is not to just take whatever is left over from Yajna, but the product, the profit which we make out of our cooperative endeavor, that if I share only portion which comes rightfully to me, then I don't have a guilty feeling.\n\nIf I run a company, there's a profit. If I don't become so greedy that nobody else get, everybody suffers. But I get the lion's share but once. As we have seen earlier, if you get the lion's share of what comes out of the collective activity, everybody has put their sacrifice in it. They put their efforts in it. What came out of that activity.\n\nIf I take away lion's share, then I'm a thief. But if I take what is rightfully mine, what comes to me as prasad from that activity, there will not be any guilt feeling. What I take from this community, I give it back. I live in Hendricko County. I use their services, I pay my taxes. You have no guilt feeling.\n\nIf you're not paying your taxes, you will have guilt feeling. The good people who eat the remnants of yajna, the the rightful portion which comes to them as prasad of the Yajna, they are freed from all sin. They have no bondage of actions. As we have seen, the actions have this chain reaction of cause and effect. They will not be binding to those who work in the spirit of Yajna and only take what is rightfully theirs. At the end of that endeavor, bhunja tete twadam papa e Pachanti atma karana.\n\nSame idea is now described. But one who is only acting for himself that he wants his action to benefit him alone. That one who is cooking for himself Pachanti one who digest. In other words, one who only work for himself and he does not want anyone else to get benefit of his actions. He is pachanti atmakarana. Such a person is eating sins.\n\nIn other words, he will have guilty feeling. No matter how much you avoid, let other people know what you are doing. But your mind will constantly tell you that what you are doing is very selfish. That you are not taking care of any. If all people around me are suffering and I am enjoying just the comforts which are available to me then I'm basically living in guilt. So the bunjate, those who are only acting for themselves and not thinking about the rest of the community, the universe where I'm part of it.\n\nBecause we are not island by ourselves in this universe. I exist because universe exists and we are all connected with each other. Now that idea is now in the next two verses are very clearly demonstrated by Bhagawan that there is no separate existence for anything in this world. Everything is connected with each other. Everything is dependent for its own existence on something else. It starts with us, the beings.\n\nThese are two very famous verses. He said Annad Bhavati Bhutani. This is the most obvious thing Bhagavan can state. That's something you and I can vouch for that my body is made up of nothing but food. So the beings are nothing but modification of food. Any being, any entity which is an animate entity you can think of is nothing but modification of food when it comes to the gross expression of that being.\n\nSo Annad Bhavati Bhutani the beings are created from food. The food supports the existence of being. Very obvious to all of us. No really argument here. Parjanyat Anna Sambhavah. And this food is only possible because of rains.\n\nSwamiji used to remind us that even people who are non vegetarian who are eating meat, the meat also comes from nothing but the food eaten. The vegetables or whatever grows out of ground by those animals. So they used to say there are two steps removed vegetarians. Bhagavan said that food is only possible because the rain is coming down. And therefore we are afraid of drought. If there is a drought, there will be famine.\n\nThere won't be anything to eat. And then people will eventually die. All beings will die because there is no food. Food is the basic ingredient which makes people in existence. And rains are possible because of collective actions. Now, obviously this concept was difficult, as I said, for people probably who did not have this climate change.\n\nBut now we can understand the rains. The climate which is supporting this cycle, eco cycle is basically dependent on the overall actions of all beings on this planet and elsewhere. Probably also in our Vedic tradition, there is no rain. They will do some kind of Yajna to invoke the rain Gods. Swamiji even mentioned that even today people have experimented. But even if we keep that aside, our actions will keep this natural balance in the environment, so that the production of food becomes regular and our existence becomes possible.\n\nYajnaha Karma Samud Bhavaha. So the Yajna, the cooperative actions of all beings in harmony with nature, will create rains. But this cooperative action is possible because individual actions, Karma Samudbhavam that obviously we understand, unless each one of us do our part, there won't be a cooperative action. There won't be Yajna. There is no communal projects. So when you do communal project, the unit is an individual action.\n\nKarma Brahma Udbhavam. Now this is where I think it's slightly complicated with various translators have translated very differently. At least this Bhagavad Gyasik, this Brahma is Brahma, the Creator. The Karma is possible because Brahma has created this universe. The other translation I have seen which says Veda Karma is possible because of Veda. In other words, Veda instructs you how to act in this world.\n\nSo we can go back to that ritualism. Veda says what Karma Kant to perform. And you are now performing Karma according to that Karma Kant. And therefore this Yajna is possible. That's one definition. Or you can also look at it as this universe which is considered as the Brahma's creation that makes the individual action possible.\n\nWithout that, there is no individual action. So it's a Karma Brahma Udbhavam with the know that Brahma Aksala Samudbhavam and that Veda or that Brahma is possible because of that imperishable Brahman, that imperishable self, then uncaused cause of all things, then imperishable Brahman is the root substratum for all that is happening. Tasmat Sarvagatam, Brahmanityam, Yagni, Pratishtama. Therefore that all pervading self is always present in any action, in any Yajna. Without that all pervading self, none of this was possible.",
      "reflection": "Choose one action today—any action—and practice doing it with full attention but without attachment to results. Whether it's sending an email, having a conversation, or completing a task, offer it as best you can and then release your grip on the outcome.\n\nNotice what happens when you work this way. Is there more freedom? More presence? More energy? The Gita's teaching of Karma Yoga isn't about becoming passive or indifferent. It's about working with full engagement while remaining internally free.\n\nAsk yourself: Where in my life am I most attached to results? What would change if I could offer my best effort and then surrender the outcome?"

      "commentary": "So we are now discussing chapter three, Karma Yoga, Yoga of Action. We have seen so far, Raghavan says. Sa yagnaha prajaha srushtva pura uacha Prajapati an inna prasivaschiddam isha bah twastikamadhu. In the beginning, when the Prajapati created beings Praja, he also created Yajna. So we are right now concerned about Praja. Praja means human beings.\n\nSo the Lord of Praja is Prajapati. The one who propagates progeny is Prajapati. So from that perspective all parents are Prajapati. So we are Prajapati for our Praja, for our children. So what we do for our children is not that we have given them life or created their existence, but we also have to create sustenance for them. So what we do is we give them education.\n\nThen say this education will be your milch cow. Use this education to get whatever you want. Prajapati is mentioned in Hiranya Gharba Sukta in Dhruva. So the Rig Veda says that previously there was nothing but Hiranyagarbha. So Hiranya Garbha is something like the condition before the Big Bang. All the potentiality but no reality.\n\nSo there is a singularity or the potentiality but no reality. So that Hiranya Garbha then out of its own potential, its own creative urgent, creates a mind. This is also mentioned in Brihadaranya Upanishad and Chandogya Upanishad. Brihadaranyak Upanishad describes this Hirinyagarba. Thus he says, first there was nothing but death and hunger. So death means nothingness.\n\nThere is nothing, there is nothing to devour, nothing to enjoy by senses, because there are no senses, there is nothing. And then he creates mind out of his creative force. And with that mind he creates water. And then water create a fire, then whatever in the water solidifies and becomes earth. So basically the creation is explained from the beginning, when there was no creation from the no creation to creation and then a being is born in that and that's it. That being said let this body of mine be fit for a sacrifice.\n\nSo that's the creation of your prajapati. In our modern day scriptures we say brahma is the prajapati. Brahma is the creator is the prajapati. But here prajapati is very defined as the pati of praja the beings. See in our puranas we also have daksha prajapati. He is lord of all beings.\n\nIn daksha his father in law was a prajapati. So there are several versions of this word prajapati but basically here in this case it means the primordial being from which the praja came. And then obviously that being was also concerned how this praja will prosper for any family man his goal is to expand his family. So it actually says anayne prasivishadvam, may you propagate your progeny through this. May you multiply with this. We also can take it as may you grow with this.\n\nAnd then he said that this yajna which I have created is your milchka the sacrifice. That which I have created is the giver of all that you desire, all that you need. That's what Bhagavan started in saying. Sacrifice was created, Spirit of sacrifice was created at the same time the praja was created. The praja can only sustain itself by sacrifice. That basically was the intention of that verse.\n\nAnd it almost seems like that the whole idea comes from the Brihadaranya Upanishad. The same idea is also in Kathopani sadh. So basically there is a being who is the first created being. This will be similar to the christian theory of Adam being the first man. It says that ishtakamadhu for you this will be your milchka, the sacrifice. The spirit of sacrifice will be all that you need.\n\nAnd then from that you can get anything that you want. Uprisa also says prajapati has two types of sons. One are the devas and other asuras. Now even if we don't get into our Puranic and Vedic theories of our devas and asuras at our micro level the devas are our senses. And if I take care of my senses, my senses will take care of me. If I take care of my eyes, I will take care of my world of seeing.\n\nIf I take care of my ears, my ears will take care of my world, of my sound my world will be taken care of if I take care of my senses. So he said that you nourish the Devas and Devas will nourish you. At a global level or universal, we can say devas are the phenomenal forces, the nature. If I cherish nature, nature will cherish me. And probably it was difficult to understand this concept 100 years ago. But in today's time, with the global warming and all the concern about climate change, we can understand that if we as human beings don't take care of the climate, the environment, the environment will not be able to support us as a species on this planet.\n\nThe Bhagavan said that you nourish Devas and Devas will nourish you.

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter three, Karma Yoga and so far we have seen that act you must, because that is the nature of the Prakriti and you are part of the Prakriti. And Prakriti is maintained by each other's actions. And since you are part of that, you have a duty to perform your part in the Prakriti. How long do I have to continue performing these actions? Bhagavan said, as long as you are identified with the Prakriti. As long as I consider this body, mind and intellect to be me, I have to continue performing Niyata Karma, the karmas that are ordained by the roles which I take as part of this Prakriti.\n\nSo when I say this is me and now I take the role, I have duties to be performed. But when I get out of this identification with this Prakriti which is right now, this body, mind and intellect and identify with the self, then there is no action. Bhagawan says for such a person, one who is reveling in the self is satisfied with the self. For such a person there is no action because he does not have anything to gain which he not have gained already. Once I get out of this identification with the limited self and identify with this supreme self, there is nothing to be gained, nothing to be competing against, and nothing that I have to do to achieve what I'm trying to achieve right now, which is a complete bliss and a complete happiness. Because that the very nature of the self, the very nature of the self is Sat chit and Ananda.\n\nRight now I'm trying to get out of this mortality. I'm 66 and my life in sun goes till 80. It will be better if I die before 80 because all these premiums I have paid all this life will be in vain. If I die one day after 80, so I can see my mortality. People ask me, when are you going to retire? I say I have no plan.\n\nBut then I say I am already 66. In next 5 hours I will be 71 will I be able to function? So whether I like it or not, I am bound by mortality. And what I'm trying to do is overcome that mortality. I'm seeing myself as sat. I'm trying to overcome a SAT ever existing.\n\nI always find myself to be not knowledgeable enough. I don't know everything that I need to know. So I'm constantly in the quest for learning more and more and more with that chit. The very nature of the self is all knowing. So there's nothing more to be known. And right now all I'm trying to get out of is the unhappy unconducive situation.\n\nSo I will be in Ananda once and that's this nature. As long as you're identified with this Prakriti, you have to be bound by the laws of Prakriti that every constituent part has to function to make the Prakriti function. And therefore as long as you identified with the Prakrutti, you have to do your part. Once you identify with this self, none of the laws of Prakrutti are applicable to you. Prakrutti will sustain by itself. That's not your responsibility.\n\nBecause you say okay, I'm satisfied with the self and I don't do who will do? The one question everybody has, everybody can realize this. Who will do all these things which is happening in this world? He said, that's not your problem. Prakriti will take care of itself. You are in trouble right now.\n\nYou are in pain right now of this unhappiness. You want to get out of it. Once you get out of this identification, you have nothing else to do. There is no action for such a person. Say, till that time what am I supposed to do? Asaktaha Karya Samacha.\n\nTill that time you continue working performing all your Niyata Karma. Except right now you are performing with attachment. That people will recognize me at least if I do something for my family. My family will say, you're doing good, I'm doing it out of attachment. He said, you just do without attachment, continue doing what you are doing. Except Asaktah Karma Samachara, you do all your action without attachment.\n\nWith that minor adjustment in what you are doing, you will achieve that perfection. Many people in the past, Janak Adayah Janak and others Karma Nai vahi samsiddhaha, they have achieved this just by performing their actions diligently without any attachment. And they achieve the perfection. So could you, so should you. And then he said, now that If I have come to the conclusion that I have done everything, I really don't have to achieve anything, then what should I do? Still continued act in this world, at least for the Loka Sangraha, for the welfare of the society.\n\nOnce I come to the conclusion that I have achieved everything I have achieved, you continue to contribute your contribution to the society, for the welfare of the society. That's because the same poison which you have right now, of your own ego, once you take that and dilute it, right now this ego is identified with this limited self. I call me this body, mind and intellect. I take this ego and dilute it with a larger arena, it will lose its bite. 1985 Camp at the end of it, there was a question answer session. Somebody asked Swamiji, Swamiji, do you have ego?\n\nWhat could be the answer? Swamiji, of course I have ego. He said, without ego, how can I control all of you? And now what we think is, if he has ego, I have ego. So what is the difference between you and I? Why am I wasting my one week and all these dollars to come here and spend time here?\n\nThen the second part of his answer is always is what comes out as the real answer. Yes, I have ego, and so should you. Because without ego, you cannot function. Without any identification, no activity can take place. However, when you take that ego and dilute it. So say you take a pinch of salt and put it in a cup of water and you taste the water, it will be salty.\n\nYou take the same water and put it in a jar of water. That salt will not be that noticeable. You take that same jar of water and put it into a whole pond of water. That salt is nowhere to be found. It is still there, so diluted in this body of water that that salt is not effective anymore. Same ego which is right now is so bothersome to me.\n\nWhen I take it and apply it to a larger group of people. When I identify with my family, it is much more manageable. When I identify with my community, it's even more manageable. I identify with my nation, I become a patriot, I become a hero. When I identify with the whole cosmos, Bhagavan said, you become the realized person. So he said, those who are satisfied with the self, by the self, they have no action other than those.\n\nAll of your actions, how long? As long as you identify with it. And then he said, even after you realize that you. You have to still continue to work for the Loka Sangha mystery, for the Benefit Society. Now he's giving his own example. So one who has realized what the reality of life is.\n\nYadi aham na varteyam jatum karmani atandritah Mama vartmanuvartante manusyaha partha sarvasah. We also seen that Yatyat Acharati sreshta tattat eva itarojanah. It is the very nature of our being that we need something to follow. Some role model, some standard to follow. So someone becomes a role model in our life. Our parents, our teacher, our three year old granddaughter.\n\nShe comes to me and says dada, let's do numbers. So we'll put numbers on the floor. And I say okay, now I'll ask you. He said no, no, I'll ask you, show me number five. So obviously I'll say but Medha, how about I ask you no, no, no, show me number five. So then I'll purposely show you number six and say that's number five.\n\nThat's not number five. See, Mimik's her teacher. See what she sees in her class. She wants to practice on Meena. She doesn't want to be a student here, she wants to be her teacher. She actually does exactly what her teacher.\n\nBecause we have a tendency to follow the behavior we find attractive. So Yatyat acharyati sreshta Purusha. So you have to set a standard of your behavior. Because people are going to follow you whether you like it or not. Because you are role model to somebody. And therefore he says, even when you reach the highest state where there is no action left for you, you have to continue working.\n\nBecause I as the supreme being, once we realize the self, he becomes the one with him. If I stop working, other people will follow my example. Other beings will follow my example and they will stop working also. Mama vartmanu vartanti manusyaha partha sarvasaram. We said that Rama took Avatara to set standards for us. What is the standard for good son?\n\nWhat is the standard for a good husband? What is the standard of a good king? What is the standard of a good father? But he came to demonstrate what is a model behavior. We may or may not agree with him on certain things. So Ramayana is Acharyaniya.\n\nEverything Rama did is to be followed. Krishna, he is not Acharyani at all. What he did you cannot do. Because he did the dance on Kali Nag, we cannot do that. And therefore you also cannot have 1008 or whatever the wives he had we can have. So we have to set a role model.\n\nWhen we become the supreme we still have a role to play. But once it is the Supreme, I have the role to play. If I don't do my role, other people will stop. Utsidehu IME Lo Kaha Nakuriyam Karma Chet Aham If I stop working or acting, this world will perish. So now I think we come to the conclusion that Krishna is not talking about him as the Devaki son. Because the world did not stop working after Krishna gone.\n\nIt's still going on him as the first person singular as the self which is all pervading. The Creator and the controller of this universe. If that stops functioning, this world will perish. This world is functioning as a cosmos and not as chaos because it has laws. We all know there are laws of nature. No denying because we can test it right now.\n\nGo on a second floor and jump out of the window. The laws which Newton found out are still very valid after all these years.

      ],
      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter three, Karma Yoga and so far we have seen that act you must, because that is the nature of the Prakriti and you are part of the Prakriti. And Prakriti is maintained by each other's actions. And since you are part of that, you have a duty to perform your part in the Prakriti. How long do I have to continue performing these actions? Bhagavan said, as long as you are identified with the Prakriti. As long as I consider this body, mind and intellect to be me, I have to continue performing Niyata Karma, the karmas that are ordained by the roles which I take as part of this Prakriti.\n\nSo when I say this is me and now I take the role, I have duties to be performed. But when I get out of this identification with this Prakriti which is right now, this body, mind and intellect and identify with the self, then there is no action. Bhagawan says for such a person, one who is reveling in the self is satisfied with the self. For such a person there is no action because he does not have anything to gain which he not have gained already. Once I get out of this identification with the limited self and identify with this supreme self, there is nothing to be gained, nothing to be competing against, and nothing that I have to do to achieve what I'm trying to achieve right now, which is a complete bliss and a complete happiness. Because that the very nature of the self, the very nature of the self is Sat chit and Ananda.\n\nRight now I'm trying to get out of this mortality. I'm 66 and my life in sun goes till 80. It will be better if I die before 80 because all these premiums I have paid all this life will be in vain. If I die one day after 80, so I can see my mortality. People ask me, when are you going to retire? I say I have no plan.\n\nBut then I say I am already 66. In next 5 hours I will be 71 will I be able to function? So whether I like it or not, I am bound by mortality. And what I'm trying to do is overcome that mortality. I'm seeing myself as sat. I'm trying to overcome a SAT ever existing.\n\nI always find myself to be not knowledgeable enough. I don't know everything that I need to know. So I'm constantly in the quest for learning more and more and more with that chit. The very nature of the self is all knowing. So there's nothing more to be known. And right now all I'm trying to get out of is the unhappy unconducive situation.\n\nSo I will be in Ananda once and that's this nature. As long as you're identified with this Prakriti, you have to be bound by the laws of Prakriti that every constituent part has to function to make the Prakriti function. And therefore as long as you identified with the Prakrutti, you have to do your part. Once you identify with this self, none of the laws of Prakrutti are applicable to you. Prakrutti will sustain by itself. That's not your responsibility.\n\nBecause you say okay, I'm satisfied with the self and I don't do who will do? The one question everybody has, everybody can realize this. Who will do all these things which is happening in this world? He said, that's not your problem. Prakriti will take care of itself. You are in trouble right now.\n\nYou are in pain right now of this unhappiness. You want to get out of it. Once you get out of this identification, you have nothing else to do. There is no action for such a person. Say, till that time what am I supposed to do? Asaktaha Karya Samacha.\n\nTill that time you continue working performing all your Niyata Karma. Except right now you are performing with attachment. That people will recognize me at least if I do something for my family. My family will say, you're doing good, I'm doing it out of attachment. He said, you just do without attachment, continue doing what you are doing. Except Asaktah Karma Samachara, you do all your action without attachment.\n\nWith that minor adjustment in what you are doing, you will achieve that perfection. Many people in the past, Janak Adayah Janak and others Karma Nai vahi samsiddhaha, they have achieved this just by performing their actions diligently without any attachment. And they achieve the perfection. So could you, so should you. And then he said, now that If I have come to the conclusion that I have done everything, I really don't have to achieve anything, then what should I do? Still continued act in this world, at least for the Loka Sangraha, for the welfare of the society.\n\nOnce I come to the conclusion that I have achieved everything I have achieved, you continue to contribute your contribution to the society, for the welfare of the society. That's because the same poison which you have right now, of your own ego, once you take that and dilute it, right now this ego is identified with this limited self. I call me this body, mind and intellect. I take this ego and dilute it with a larger arena, it will lose its bite. 1985 Camp at the end of it, there was a question answer session. Somebody asked Swamiji, Swamiji, do you have ego?\n\nWhat could be the answer? Swamiji, of course I have ego. He said, without ego, how can I control all of you? And now what we think is, if he has ego, I have ego. So what is the difference between you and I? Why am I wasting my one week and all these dollars to come here and spend time here?\n\nThen the second part of his answer is always is what comes out as the real answer. Yes, I have ego, and so should you. Because without ego, you cannot function. Without any identification, no activity can take place. However, when you take that ego and dilute it. So say you take a pinch of salt and put it in a cup of water and you taste the water, it will be salty.\n\nYou take the same water and put it in a jar of water. That salt will not be that noticeable. You take that same jar of water and put it into a whole pond of water. That salt is nowhere to be found. It is still there, so diluted in this body of water that that salt is not effective anymore. Same ego which is right now is so bothersome to me.\n\nWhen I take it and apply it to a larger group of people. When I identify with my family, it is much more manageable. When I identify with my community, it's even more manageable. I identify with my nation, I become a patriot, I become a hero. When I identify with the whole cosmos, Bhagavan said, you become the realized person. So he said, those who are satisfied with the self, by the self, they have no action other than those.\n\nAll of your actions, how long? As long as you identify with it. And then he said, even after you realize that you. You have to still continue to work for the Loka Sangha mystery, for the Benefit Society. Now he's giving his own example. So one who has realized what the reality of life is.\n\nYadi aham na varteyam jatum karmani atandritah Mama vartmanuvartante manusyaha partha sarvasah. We also seen that Yatyat Acharati sreshta tattat eva itarojanah. It is the very nature of our being that we need something to follow. Some role model, some standard to follow. So someone becomes a role model in our life. Our parents, our teacher, our three year old granddaughter.\n\nShe comes to me and says dada, let's do numbers. So we'll put numbers on the floor. And I say okay, now I'll ask you. He said no, no, I'll ask you, show me number five. So obviously I'll say but Medha, how about I ask you no, no, no, show me number five. So then I'll purposely show you number six and say that's number five.\n\nThat's not number five. See, Mimik's her teacher. See what she sees in her class. She wants to practice on Meena. She doesn't want to be a student here, she wants to be her teacher. She actually does exactly what her teacher.\n\nBecause we have a tendency to follow the behavior we find attractive. So Yatyat acharyati sreshta Purusha. So you have to set a standard of your behavior. Because people are going to follow you whether you like it or not. Because you are role model to somebody. And therefore he says, even when you reach the highest state where there is no action left for you, you have to continue working.\n\nBecause I as the supreme being, once we realize the self, he becomes the one with him. If I stop working, other people will follow my example. Other beings will follow my example and they will stop working also. Mama vartmanu vartanti manusyaha partha sarvasaram. We said that Rama took Avatara to set standards for us. What is the standard for good son?\n\nWhat is the standard for a good husband? What is the standard of a good king? What is the standard of a good father? But he came to demonstrate what is a model behavior. We may or may not agree with him on certain things. So Ramayana is Acharyaniya.\n\nEverything Rama did is to be followed. Krishna, he is not Acharyani at all. What he did you cannot do. Because he did the dance on Kali Nag, we cannot do that. And therefore you also cannot have 1008 or whatever the wives he had we can have. So we have to set a role model.\n\nWhen we become the supreme we still have a role to play. But once it is the Supreme, I have the role to play. If I don't do my role, other people will stop. Utsidehu IME Lo Kaha Nakuriyam Karma Chet Aham If I stop working or acting, this world will perish. So now I think we come to the conclusion that Krishna is not talking about him as the Devaki son. Because the world did not stop working after Krishna gone.\n\nIt's still going on him as the first person singular as the self which is all pervading. The Creator and the controller of this universe. If that stops functioning, this world will perish. This world is functioning as a cosmos and not as chaos because it has laws. We all know there are laws of nature. No denying because we can test it right now.\n\nGo on a second floor and jump out of the window. The laws which Newton found out are still very valid after all these years. So there are laws in nature and then laws are enforced. So he remained law giver and law enforcer and he does not take a day off. If he takes a day off and the laws are mixed up that day, world will be in chaos. Law of thermodynamics Work on Monday through Friday but stop working on Saturday.\n\nSunday takes a weekend. I wouldn't be able to come here because the car won't start. So he said without taking any break, I have to continue working because this world will only function. The Prakriti will only follow the laws if I am there to support these laws. Sankrasi Chakarta Syam Upahanyami Imaha Prajaha we have great difficulty because we have so much of our cultural burden. All these hundreds of years of our caste system and whatever we want to call it that we keep getting into.",

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter three, Karma Yoga, Yoga of Actions. And so far we have learned that act we must because we are part of this Prakriti. The Prakriti functions because each individual constituent parts work with each other. Just as we have seen in a cycle of rain during the summer, the ocean water becomes clouds and then clouds become rain and the cycle continue. So there is a cycle in this Prakriti which is dependent on its constituent parts, the Prakriti. This manifest world works because each constituent part work with each other.\n\nWe being part of this Prakriti, we have our own duties and we need to fulfill their duties. So the advice is perform all your ordained duties, duties which come with the roles which I take in my life. I take a role of a father, role of a husband, role of an employer, an employee, a son. Whatever role I take, I should perform those actions. So once I understood that this is a part of my duty, I have to continue acting. But then I have come to realize that these actions create bondage.\n\nThe bondage of actions and reactions, the reward and punishment. So how do I get out of this? Bhagwan said, act without attachment. If you act with the sense of doership, you are responsible for your actions. And therefore either you will get the credit for it or a punishment for it. So act without attachment and you will not be bound by your actions.\n\nAnd then the next thing we have seen is that even though I consider that I have nothing more to do now I have achieved everything I need to achieve, it will still continue to act because other people are following your example. As human beings, we have tendency to follow others to act in our life. We need some role model, we need some guidance, we need some standards. And those standards are other people whom I consider to be my role models. I follow them and I become role model for others. And therefore, at any given time I should be acting in appropriate manner.\n\nSo others who are following me get the right role model standard to act for themselves. Once I considered that I'm not attached And I'm working. I'm working for the Loka Sangram, for the welfare of the society. Bhagawan said, even you can look at my own example. As the Creator, I have nothing to gain in these three worlds. But I continue to work as the law giver and law enforcer in this universe.\n\nThis universe is never without laws. There are no weakens in our natural laws. Law of physics doesn't stop functioning because now it's the leap year on 29th of February. I don't know what to do. There is no exception in nature because the Creator remained as the lawgiver and law enforcer in this universe. So we want to look at I as the Creator.\n\nEven though I have nothing to gain, I continue to work. Because if I do not work, this world will cease to exist. The cycle of creation, maintenance and destruction continues because the Creator continues to support it. That substratum which creates the substratum for this universe is always present in the universe to function. I, as the part of the Parakrati, should follow that lead and do the same. Continue to act even when I don't consider that I have anything to gain just for the welfare of the society.\n\nEven when you consider that other people are acting with attachment. Now I have come to the conclusion that the best way to act in this world is one. Do my duties as ordained by my roles I play, but act without attachment. So have no attachment to your actions and perform actions. But I know that the world is not made up of all those detached sannyasis. The people needs motivation for them to act.\n\nTheir motivation may be the goals they want to achieve in their life, their attachment to their actions, their passions. I as the one other Gnani, have a responsibility to make sure that they don't get confused by this high philosophy. So the next verse says, Nabuddi Vedam Janayat Agnanam Karma Sangi Naam. It's a great responsibility on a person who has achieved knowledge that with my knowledge I don't confuse others. You know, in our Gita class, the one common thing we hear is, I'm more confused now than I was before I came to this class. More you know, more you will know than more I don't know.\n\nAnd that's a biggest responsibility in the part of the wise person. To guide the society in a right manner so that people don't take the wrong message from your advice. One person was alcoholic, so his father or a teacher wanted to give an example and say, let me show you what an alcohol does to you. He takes a glass of alcohol, puts a little worm in it and the worm obviously after a while dies. Did you see what happened? Yes, yes, I understood what happened.\n\nIf I drink alcohol, all the worms on my stomach will die. One person was trying to find out where is the brain of a cockroach. He was a researcher obviously like Guptaji and all the people. I'm going to find out where is the brain of the cockroach in his body. So he puts a food in front of the cockroach, cockroach runs towards the food. So he figures out cockroach does have brain.\n\nNow let me find out where the brain is. He breaks his one leg, cockroach limps towards the foot. He still has brain was not in that leg. He breaks another leg, he still limps to that. So brain was not in that leg. He breaks the last leg and the cockroach can't move towards the food and say I figured out the brain was in the last leg which I broke.\n\nFrom your observations and conclusions and the advice that you hear, unless you're prepared for that, you may come to the wrong conclusion. So it's the great responsibility on the teacher and the wise people to guide the society appropriately without confusing them. Nabuddi Vedam Janayat Agnaram Karma Sanghi naam. The ignorant people who are working in this world with attachment it should not create confusion their mind so they stop working. There was a time when some philosophies make people giving up everything and become sannyasi or a monk. Is the real goal of life well, after all figured out, the society just can function like that.\n\nIf all the young people become sannyasis, who would support the Social Security for people like me who will be retiring? We need people to work so you should not unsettle them. Josayat Sarvakarmani Vidhvan Yuktaha Samacharan For a Vidhvan person, the one who is knowledgeable and is Yukta who is balanced. He knows how to motivate people. And if they are working with an attachment, encourage them to work. Jose Sarva somehow engage all of them in actions so the action doesn't stop.\n\nBecause if they are acting, there is a chance that sometime they will understand what is the right way to act. Swamiji gives an example that if I am driving in a wrong direction, if I stop driving, I will never reach the right destination. But if I continue driving and then ask somebody and find a direction, then continue driving, I will reach my destination all the time. The Operative word is driving. As long as I keep driving and then correct my direction, I'll find destination. So it is up to us not to confuse our children.\n\nPeople who listen to us and say this is of no value. What are you going to gain in life? And that's not the way to guide the society. So anybody who has the criticism that the Hinduism teaches pessimism, it teaches actions consistently all throughout your life. There is no discussion of retirement here. Sad Bhagawan says, please make sure as a Vidhvaan person that all people are engaged in actions because activity is the signature of nature.\n\nPrakrutehe kriyamanani gunaihi karmani sarvasah. Then where is this confusion coming between the one who is acting with an attachment, one who is acting without an attachment. Why the one acting without an attachment is more efficient. One with acting with an attachment is less efficient. The reason for me to act without attachment is not to detach myself from what's happening but to become more efficient in what I'm doing. More I get attached more.\n\nMy mental energy will be dissipated into the worries about what will come out of my actions. That I will be employing one third of my energy into what may come out of my actions. 1/3 of my energy into what happened last time when I did this, only 1/3 energy is available for me. To last proposal I did, I did not win it. Am I going to win this one? That will take away my complete focus on what needs to be done.\n\nTherefore detachment is necessary that I focus on the present only and function in it. But where is this confusion coming for me where I get attached to my actions and it says this ignorance about how the world works. The actions in this world are working by their own nature. Prakrutehi kriyamanani gunehi karmani sarvasah. All actions performed in this universe are performed because of the gunas of the prakriti of the objects. But I on the other hand think I am the doer.\n\nAhankara removed atma out of my ignorance by my ego. Karta aham ithimanyate I think I am the doer. Even though guna gunesuvarthantaha we are not island by ourselves, but we can function by ourselves. If everybody moves away from this town and I am the only one left for a few days there will be a very fun because I could walk into Starbucks, nobody can stop me. Get a cup of coffee myself, go to the food line and get Whatever grocery I want. After sometime there won't be anything to do for me because there's nobody else doing anything for me.\n\nI am surviving because other people are doing their part. Therefore I'm functioning as I'm functioning. Once I come to that conclusion that things are working because these constituent parts of this Prakriti are working with each other then I will not develop the ego that I am the doer. I go to the lab and take the hydrogen oxygen and put them together and become water. Now I say I created water. I said no, no Neil, Hydrogen oxygen acted on each other and they behaved as per their qualities to create water.\n\nYou are just a mere agent to put them together. So you are not the doer. You are just a Nimitta, Matra, Ahanka, ra, Vimu, dhatma, Karta, ahamiti many. He starts thinking that I am the doer. Whereas the actions are performed by the Prakruti by its own nature. Everything in this Prakriti has sattva, rajas and Tamas.\n\nThe basic ingredients in each thing. Those ingredients when they come in contact with each other they function according to their own nature. So two atoms come together. No atomic scientist to do engineered to do anything. Those atoms will act with each other according to their own gunas. Prakrutehe guna, Sammudaha, sajante guna, karma.\n\nSo one who is ignorant about this nature of Prakriti in the Gunas of Prakriti he gets attached to the actions. When I do something and then I get success. I'm now attached to my actions. Because I think I achieved this success. I forget that what I submitted as my project There are about 18 people in my office has to work on it.",
      "reflection": "Choose one action today—any action—and practice doing it with full attention but without attachment to results. Whether it's sending an email, having a conversation, or completing a task, offer it as best you can and then release your grip on the outcome.\n\nNotice what happens when you work this way. Is there more freedom? More presence? More energy? The Gita's teaching of Karma Yoga isn't about becoming passive or indifferent. It's about working with full engagement while remaining internally free.\n\nAsk yourself: Where in my life am I most attached to results? What would change if I could offer my best effort and then surrender the outcome?"

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter three, Karma Yoga, Yoga of Action. So we have seen in last few verses. Bhagavan says that Prakrute, he, kriyamanani, gunaihi, karmani, sarvasa, all actions are performed by Prakriti. Ahankara, vimu, dhatma, karta, aham ithimanyade. But the one who is deluded by ego, he thinks he is the doer. So this is something Bhagavan is trying to clarify, which we have learnt in chapter two, that Purusha is the enabler.\n\nPrakriti functions when Purusha and Prakriti come together. But all actions belong to Prakriti. There is no activity in I, the Purusha that we consider our own self, the I which last time we talked of will and free will. German philosopher Schopenhauer wrote a book called the World as Will and Representation. So this will is the force which enables the Prakriti to represent itself. So here we are saying the actions are performed in Prakrut.\n\nThere is something similar to a situation that in my house there are several gadgets which generates heat, light, sound, picture which makes the house lively and livable. But all this equipment are only functioning when they're electrified. So if a bulb somehow gets this ego that I am the one who gives light, then the electricity as the guru can come and tell that bulb that no, no. All activities are performed by all equipment, but not because of themselves, but because of the electricity functioning through them. But activity does not belong to electricity. Bulb not functioning well or is dim or bright.\n\nIt does not belong to the electricity that belongs to the bulb itself. See, the bulb is getting jealousy. That other bulb is brighter and I am dimmer and I have to do something to be brighter. All that belongs to Prakriti. But once it's first of all know that you are not the doer. Your dimness or brightness belongs to the equipment and not to you, the electricity.\n\nAhanka, rimu, dhatma, karatha, hamiti, mandy, he thinks that he is the doer. But the one who knows Tattvitu Mahabaha Guna Karma Vibhaga. But one who knows the reality, the truth about this is the guna and a Karma. He knows the gunas of the Prakriti. Vijay Sattvaraja Saint Tamas and their functions. Function of Sattva is to be in existence, in knowledge.\n\nRajas is activity and Tamas is inertia. They have their own gunas, things which are made up of these three gunas in Prakriti. They function according to those gunas and permutation combinations of those gunas. Guna Gunesajjade Knowing that the qualities of my senses and the sense objects outside, when they come together, when the activity takes place, as we have seen last time, that the senses create sensation on the mind, the sensation creates the perception in mind. That perception conception of that object, that conception of that object. If it is in line with my tendencies, then it creates action.\n\nIf it is not in line with my tendency, I won't even pay attention. There are so many sensations come to me, but I am only aware of those I am paying attention to. And I am paying attention to those only which are in line with my tendencies. So Bhagavan says, Guna Guneshu Vartan Tah. My guna is this limited being and the guna of the objects outside, they are acting with each other, but I remains uninvolved. So the verse we have seen which is almost a summary of Karma Yoga in two lines.\n\nBhagavan says how to practice Karma Yoga. Mai sarvani Karmani Sanyasya Adhyatma Cheta Saha Nirasi Nirmamo Bhatva Yidyaswa Vigatha Juraha. Renouncing all actions in me with mind centered on yourself. It's like that electricity guru telling that bulb that you offer all your light to me. It is me who enables you to give light. You just focus on your own self.\n\nWhat is your reality? Nirasi Nirmamo Bhatva. You do not have any expectation what will come out of me. So don't consider your past achievement is yours. All that was happening for that bulb is because of electricity. As long as electricity is functioning, whether it was giving a good light or a bad light or it was performing according to the expectation of the home owner or not.\n\nAll that is because of the electricity. Whatever is coming out of you as actions, devote all of them to me, the enabler. So here the me, as Bhagavan said, is Your own self, your true self which is limitless. You are binding it into your own limitedness. You offer all your actions to me and do not have any expectations. Do not dwell in future.\n\nWhat will happen in future? Will my actions generate good results or not? Will I achieve something or not? All that is a you live it to the Karma Falada and Nirmamaha. All you exemplished in the past is also past. We have a great tendency, most of the olden cultures to dwell in past and say we used to have great culture.\n\nLook at our culture in Mahabharata. Look at our culture in Rama's time. That doesn't really matter. What are you doing right now matters. Your culture right now. Are we the most cultured people on this planet?\n\nDo we have the right values or are we corrupt people? That matters what we are doing right now, not what we did in the past. Not we may do in the future. So Bhagawan said Nirasi Nirmammu Bhatva Yudhishva Bhikha Jwaraha. You engage in your activity. Inactivity is not an option for you.\n\nYou engage in your activity without having these agitations in your mind which is like a fever will rob your energy. This agitations about what will I get in the future and what are my accomplishments in the past. Forget about all of that. Become completely healthy to function in present. That's basically a summary of Karma Yoga. Act in present, do not worry about the future.\n\nDo not regret what you did or did not do or accomplish in the past. And engage yourself in actions. Devote all actions to the enabler, the self in you. You can only act as long as you are living. You will not be able to act when you die. After your death, there is no activity for this limited body.\n\nSo therefore offer all your actions to the enabler, the consciousness, your own self. And then Bhagavan says, Yeme Matamin, this is my opinion whether you like it or not. But I'm telling you, this is my Eme Matamidam Nityam Anuthisthanti Manavah. Those people who follow these teachings of mine. This teaching which I have just taught you, the Karma Yoga, how to act in this world, Offer your actions to the Supreme Self, the supreme will. Our desire is to live.\n\nSo there is a will to live, a will to act. Free will is something when I have more choices and I can choose one of them, that's a free will. If I have a Desire to play outside as a child. But my mother said that you have to do homework. Well if I can decide it's a free will. But if my mother decides then no, no.\n\nYou can go out to play right now but do your homework. That's not a free will. So Bhagavan says that you have free will. A very narrow window. Either you can choose my teachings of how to act in this world outside or other opinions you have how you can get your happiness by your actions. So we do have a concept in the last time we argued about whether we have concept of free.\n\nWe do have a concept of free. We call it Purushartha Purushasthana Prarabdha. Prarabdhdha is something I have no control over. There is no free will there in Prarabdha. The situation I'm facing is because of my past actions. Those past actions go as long as I can think about my existence.\n\nThis life, previous life, life previous to that, whatever that is. That's Prarabdha situation is presented to me by my Prarabdha. The way I act in this situation is my Purushart. I don't have a complete free will that I can do whatever I want Because I can't change the situation. But I do have free will to act within the circumstances. See, will of an individual is always limited.\n\nA complete free will is the universal will. The will of God as we call it in our religious terminology. Universal will is free. I have a limited free will and I can exercise that free will. So Bhagawan said those who exercise their narrow free will to follow my teachings Eme matamidam nityam Anuthisthati Manava who constantly follow my teachings. Sraddhavantaha Anusuyantaha muchante tiyapi Karmabhi.\n\nThose who follow my teachings with Shraddha without raising trivial doubts it is my opinion that they will also achieve the liberation from Karma Naiskarma Siddhe. They will achieve the final goal. So here couple of things we can look at. What Bhagavan is saying is that you may have your own doubts whether this is really workable. This Karma Yoga we had been talking about. Act without any expectations.\n\nDon't have any regrets about what you achieved all the way. Unless I have a passion to achieve something. If I have a fire in my belly to go and get it how am I going to get it? Unless I have this passion to achieve and I'LL do anything to achieve it based on my tendencies. Bhagawan said, put all this thing aside. Don't raise those trivial doubts in your mind.\n\nIf you subside those trivial doubts in your mind and have Sraddha, have faith that this will work and then you follow all the time. Nityam, Anuti, Sthunti, Manava. Those people who practice, practice that narrow free will to take my advice and have faith in it and follow, they will also be released from all karma, all actions, all sorrows, all unhappiness. We may have heard before, before Gita came along, there were so many other maths as we have discussed there Sat Dashara, Samari, Swarvadi, Samarani, Swarvadi. Some say going to heaven is the only goal. And others say the liberation is the goal.\n\nThere are so many Mata. But I say Krishna says this is my Mata. You may think this is so simplistic. People say to achieve the Samadhi, Yogi has to practice for a long period of time. And you are saying Samatvam Yoga, Uchathe, just a balanced mind and you're done. So you may have lots of doubts.\n\nBut if your faith in my teachings and follow, you shall achieve that nice karma. So we have discussed many times this word Sraddha. Is it the blind faith that Krishna cannot be wrong. I have to follow him whether you like it or not. So we have come across several definitions of Sraddha. One Swamiji gives in Vivekta Dharma.\n\nHe says, my belief in what I do not know, something I do not know. I do not know whether Bhagavan exists or not. That's my belief that yes, there is a superior power. Even though I do not know what that power is right now. But I have believed that I may come to know sometime. If I work at it diligently, I will come to know that power, that supreme power.\n\nWhat I believe in is Sraddha. If I have a belief in something which I do not have a direct knowledge right now, the faith that I will come to know, then my belief is correct. Swamiji says that's Shruddha. That's Swamiji's definition. But one Shankaracharya's definition is Guru Vedant, Vakya, Adishu, Vishwas Israddha. My trust in the words of my teacher and scriptures.\n\nScriptures in a sense, the books of knowledge which I have trusted. Upanishads, Vedanta, Bible, whatever you consider book of knowledge, if you have trust in that, that's Sraddha.",

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter three, Karma Yoga, Yoga of actions. In other words, we are trying to understand how can I transform my actions which are binding me right now into liberating entities right now, every action I do, I am bound by results which are either good or bad. And this cycle continues. How can I transform this cycle of acting and reacting into liberating me? So more I act, more liberated I become right now, more I act, more bound I am, more and more I seek happiness, I collect more unhappiness. As we discussed last time, the Sukha is something which is defined by absence of dukkha.\n\nAs long as I have dukkha of any kind, sukha cannot be experienced. 99% of my body is very healthy except my heart. We typically argue when contractors find or clients find mistakes in our drawing. But look at the rest of the project, how well we have done. I said that doesn't count. Error is an error that creates problem for us.\n\nIf car you buy is 99% perfect except the engine is not firing properly, is that a good car or a lemon? So when I have some dukkha, I'm dukkhi. So more I try to achieve happiness, I somewhere along the line acquire unhappiness. So if I look at my life, it is basically more unhappiness and have a little happiness somewhere than unhappiness. Little happiness somewhere. The happiness is experienced when I don't have to gain anything.\n\nThe day I feel that I have everything I want and I don't have to acquire anything that day, I feel happy. The next moment where I realize oh, but I forgot I have to also achieve this and the unhappiness starts all over again or pursuit of happiness starts all over again. So Bhagavan said that there is a technique how you can get out of this rut of trying to get happiness and get unhappiness in the bargain. First thing he said is do it for the greater good. Don't Think about yourself. Think about whether it's going to help others.\n\nAnd then act with the first technique. Secondly, he says, all your likes and dislikes are in your senses only. The likes and dislikes of the object resides in your senses only if I close my eyes, whether there is a good side or bad side. That's why when we are afraid, we close our eyes. We don't want to see. We want to shut down that sense.\n\nSo say, know that they are at your sense level. You do not let that become yours. So you get detached from these likes and dislikes. Bhagawan also said that what can you do? You will always act according to your Prakriti Nigraha Kim karishadi. Even a wise man, he knows what is right, what is wrong.\n\nBut he cannot act accordingly. Most doctors, at least when I was in India and my friends were doctors, medical students and recently graduated doctors. They were all smoking heavily. Even a wise man who knows all that. But because the force of those vasanas will make you only behave in that manner. Till you exhaust those vasanas or till you transcend those vasanas.\n\nWhen we were children, we were hung up on little things. But as we grow up, those little attachment for the toys drop out. Because you transcended them. So as long as I'm under the sway of Vasanas, I will act according to the Vasanas Prabhupada. Once I don't let that vasana overpower you. You are going to act according to your vasanas.\n\nBut you can sublimate those as I gave you examples. Swami Dheerananda said, if you like to sing all those movie songs, convert them into Bhajans and then come and sing at the Chinmay Mission. So you can take your vasanas and give them a direction which is more conducive to your liberation that the technique is. Mai Karmani Sarvani Sanyasya. You offer all your accents to me. So all your vasanas, you offer it to him.\n\nJust like on a Shivratri. Devi said, when you offer a flower with each name, you say one of my vasanas Bhagwan, I give it to you. That's why in our culture, all this art, music, dances, is all Krishna in it. All those bandises which are done in all the different ragas, all about Krishna. Because they realized that two make this art a divine art. If you associate Bhagavan into it.\n\nSame art, same bandits. You are singing now he is a Krishna in it. So all these great Ustads, you know, who are all Muslims, but they all sunk Krishna's glory. All our dances all about Krishna. Because these are our vasana. These are our natural tendency to express ourselves into art, music, dances.\n\nBut rather than making them more perverted into some very lusty field, they say, sublimate those same vasanas into higher fields. So Bhagawan said, don't let this Vasana overpower you. You find a way to exhaust your vasanas in a manner that gives you more and more joy towards the higher goal. Offer all your actions to me. If I go to work, I say, well, I'm going it for Krishna. When you have that attitude, then you will overcome all your vasanas.\n\nThen he says, adhatma cheta sa. And you try to find out who you are. You try to figure out who you are and then continue to act in the manner which is according to your vasanas. Because Sreyan Swadharmo we're gonna have Paradharmaat Swanushtita. Sreyan Swadharma Viguna. Whatever we are doing, we always think that had I been a doctor, I would have been making more money.\n\nI didn't realize when I was going to architecture school that architects don't make much money. Actually, our teachers told us in the very first class, very first class. Any architecture school you go. The first thing they said, if you are here to make money, there is a technology engineering college next door and medical school two blocks away. Architecture is not for making money. But we still thought that that may be the only thing I can do.\n\nI want to be an architect. Swadharma, that's what you liked. So Sreyan Swadharmo Vigunaha My dharma, no matter how it seems, devoid of qualities from the society's perspective, I enjoy it. But people says, you'll be a starving artist. Why do you want to be an artist? You'll be starving artist.\n\nI want to be an artist. But society says that's not really worth much. So Sreyan Swadharma Viguna Dharma as we have defined many, many times before in this class. The law of being, what makes me who I am is my dharma. Sugar is sugar because it has its own dharma of being sweet. If it looks like sugar, it feels like sugar.\n\nBut it does not taste like sugar. When I was in science college and I studied all my education till inter science in Gujarati. So in chemistry they will say Padarthana guna dharma nu varnankaram. Describe the characteristics of the substance. And that used to be a standard test in a chemistry. They give you a substance.\n\nFirst you have to do it in an observation, smell and then tell what it is. And then the next level is. Then you prove it by doing some experiment on it. I remember I was in interscience and there was some substance came to me. It has some very peculiar quality and I don't even remember what it was which is very rare. And I kind of latched onto that and I saw that I went to the examiner and said this is what it is.\n\nThat's because I latched on to one particular quality which was unique to that substance. Without that, that substance cannot be that. Dharma is that what makes that substance what it is. My swadharma is my own vasana. The texture of my mind, my personality. It is what makes me who I am.\n\nNow that may be viguna ha. It may not be much value to others. Anytime I read all these magazines and say what Bill Gates is doing to help the humanity, what Elon Musk is doing, what the Google guy Larry Page is doing. I'm not doing anything like that. I'm barely making any difference to my own family's life or my staff's life. But that's my swadharma.\n\nThis is my swadharma. Many, many years ago when I was still very, very novice in this Bhagavad Gita classes and lectures. One thing I realized, I'm at complete ease when I am in this environment. When I'm talking about Bhagavad Gita or learning Bhagavad Gita in the class everywhere else I'm slightly uncomfortable. So that's my swadharma. So Bhagavan says Sreyan swadharmo Viganaha.\n\nIt may not be of much value to others but your good is to act according to your dharma, your swadharma. What is your vasanas? What is your texture of your personality? Paradharmat swanusthitaat. Then others dharma which seems much nobler or well discharged is the translation. Well discharged means he is doing it so easily.\n\nI met few years ago in a convention for this hotel owners association where I go there because I design hotels. Somebody who has when I was growing up in Surat, in the street there Was a Kariwala family who were. They were basically a grocery shop there. Their youngest child was like 4 or 5 years old when I was in college. So he recognized me and said, aren't you such and such? He said, you remember me?\n\nI was such and such from your street. Oh, you were a little kid. I don't remember you. And I said, what do you do? He said, well, I'm a hotel owner. So I said, well, remember I'm an architect.\n\nI said, neil, I don't really develop any hotels. I just buy hotels and sell. And he made millions doing that. He was like multimillionaires. I said, it's very easy, Neel. I just don't do anything.\n\nI just buy and then sell it. For him, it is so easy for me. That's a huge sum insight. You have to have what to buy and where to sell. So Paradharma Svanosthita is so well discharged by him his duties. But for me, that's not as easy.\n\nSwadharme Nidhanam Shreyaha by performing your duty, you may end up dying. In other words, you continue performing your duty duties in a sense what you like. And you die doing that. And may not accomplish anything from others perspective. But because it was your duty, it is better for you. Because that gave you the platform for exhausting your vasanas.\n\nThat gave you the platform for performing actions which give you joy. It may be more productive to go and do something else, but that's not your dharma. When I came to this country, I worked for a contractor for a while Because I did not have a job in architecture. And he saw some potential. Minister Neel, this is great. We need to be in a business so we can do this.\n\nAnd after about three or four months, I left the job. I said, oh, I got a job at architecture office. It was not even a permanent job. And he was paying me literally minimum wages. He said, why are you doing this? You have great opportunity.\n\nBut that's what I like. I want to be an architect. I don't want to be a contractor. So that gives me joy even at the minimum wage. But I felt like I'm doing my job. Building Paradharmo Bhayavah, others Dharma, when you try to emulate is dangerous.\n\nWe architects, we deal with developers all the time. So after all, we think that I can be Also a developer. All these people come to me to ask advice.",
      "reflection": "Choose one action today—any action—and practice doing it with full attention but without attachment to results. Whether it's sending an email, having a conversation, or completing a task, offer it as best you can and then release your grip on the outcome.\n\nNotice what happens when you work this way.

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter three, Karma Yoga, Yoga of actions. In other words, we are trying to understand how can I transform my actions which are binding me right now into liberating entities right now, every action I do, I am bound by results which are either good or bad. And this cycle continues. How can I transform this cycle of acting and reacting into liberating me? So more I act, more liberated I become right now, more I act, more bound I am, more and more I seek happiness, I collect more unhappiness. As we discussed last time, the Sukha is something which is defined by absence of dukkha.\n\nAs long as I have dukkha of any kind, sukha cannot be experienced. 99% of my body is very healthy except my heart. We typically argue when contractors find or clients find mistakes in our drawing. But look at the rest of the project, how well we have done. I said that doesn't count. Error is an error that creates problem for us.\n\nIf car you buy is 99% perfect except the engine is not firing properly, is that a good car or a lemon? So when I have some dukkha, I'm dukkhi. So more I try to achieve happiness, I somewhere along the line acquire unhappiness. So if I look at my life, it is basically more unhappiness and have a little happiness somewhere than unhappiness. Little happiness somewhere. The happiness is experienced when I don't have to gain anything.\n\nThe day I feel that I have everything I want and I don't have to acquire anything that day, I feel happy. The next moment where I realize oh, but I forgot I have to also achieve this and the unhappiness starts all over again or pursuit of happiness starts all over again. So Bhagavan said that there is a technique how you can get out of this rut of trying to get happiness and get unhappiness in the bargain. First thing he said is do it for the greater good. Don't Think about yourself. Think about whether it's going to help others.\n\nAnd then act with the first technique. Secondly, he says, all your likes and dislikes are in your senses only. The likes and dislikes of the object resides in your senses only if I close my eyes, whether there is a good side or bad side. That's why when we are afraid, we close our eyes. We don't want to see. We want to shut down that sense.\n\nSo say, know that they are at your sense level. You do not let that become yours. So you get detached from these likes and dislikes. Bhagawan also said that what can you do? You will always act according to your Prakriti Nigraha Kim karishadi. Even a wise man, he knows what is right, what is wrong.\n\nBut he cannot act accordingly. Most doctors, at least when I was in India and my friends were doctors, medical students and recently graduated doctors. They were all smoking heavily. Even a wise man who knows all that. But because the force of those vasanas will make you only behave in that manner. Till you exhaust those vasanas or till you transcend those vasanas.\n\nWhen we were children, we were hung up on little things. But as we grow up, those little attachment for the toys drop out. Because you transcended them. So as long as I'm under the sway of Vasanas, I will act according to the Vasanas Prabhupada. Once I don't let that vasana overpower you. You are going to act according to your vasanas.\n\nBut you can sublimate those as I gave you examples. Swami Dheerananda said, if you like to sing all those movie songs, convert them into Bhajans and then come and sing at the Chinmay Mission. So you can take your vasanas and give them a direction which is more conducive to your liberation that the technique is. Mai Karmani Sarvani Sanyasya. You offer all your accents to me. So all your vasanas, you offer it to him.\n\nJust like on a Shivratri. Devi said, when you offer a flower with each name, you say one of my vasanas Bhagwan, I give it to you. That's why in our culture, all this art, music, dances, is all Krishna in it. All those bandises which are done in all the different ragas, all about Krishna. Because they realized that two make this art a divine art. If you associate Bhagavan into it.\n\nSame art, same bandits. You are singing now he is a Krishna in it. So all these great Ustads, you know, who are all Muslims, but they all sunk Krishna's glory. All our dances all about Krishna. Because these are our vasana. These are our natural tendency to express ourselves into art, music, dances.\n\nBut rather than making them more perverted into some very lusty field, they say, sublimate those same vasanas into higher fields. So Bhagawan said, don't let this Vasana overpower you. You find a way to exhaust your vasanas in a manner that gives you more and more joy towards the higher goal. Offer all your actions to me. If I go to work, I say, well, I'm going it for Krishna. When you have that attitude, then you will overcome all your vasanas.\n\nThen he says, adhatma cheta sa. And you try to find out who you are. You try to figure out who you are and then continue to act in the manner which is according to your vasanas. Because Sreyan Swadharmo we're gonna have Paradharmaat Swanushtita. Sreyan Swadharma Viguna. Whatever we are doing, we always think that had I been a doctor, I would have been making more money.\n\nI didn't realize when I was going to architecture school that architects don't make much money. Actually, our teachers told us in the very first class, very first class. Any architecture school you go. The first thing they said, if you are here to make money, there is a technology engineering college next door and medical school two blocks away. Architecture is not for making money. But we still thought that that may be the only thing I can do.\n\nI want to be an architect. Swadharma, that's what you liked. So Sreyan Swadharmo Vigunaha My dharma, no matter how it seems, devoid of qualities from the society's perspective, I enjoy it. But people says, you'll be a starving artist. Why do you want to be an artist? You'll be starving artist.\n\nI want to be an artist. But society says that's not really worth much. So Sreyan Swadharma Viguna Dharma as we have defined many, many times before in this class. The law of being, what makes me who I am is my dharma. Sugar is sugar because it has its own dharma of being sweet. If it looks like sugar, it feels like sugar.\n\nBut it does not taste like sugar. When I was in science college and I studied all my education till inter science in Gujarati. So in chemistry they will say Padarthana guna dharma nu varnankaram. Describe the characteristics of the substance. And that used to be a standard test in a chemistry. They give you a substance.\n\nFirst you have to do it in an observation, smell and then tell what it is. And then the next level is. Then you prove it by doing some experiment on it. I remember I was in interscience and there was some substance came to me. It has some very peculiar quality and I don't even remember what it was which is very rare. And I kind of latched onto that and I saw that I went to the examiner and said this is what it is.\n\nThat's because I latched on to one particular quality which was unique to that substance. Without that, that substance cannot be that. Dharma is that what makes that substance what it is. My swadharma is my own vasana. The texture of my mind, my personality. It is what makes me who I am.\n\nNow that may be viguna ha. It may not be much value to others. Anytime I read all these magazines and say what Bill Gates is doing to help the humanity, what Elon Musk is doing, what the Google guy Larry Page is doing. I'm not doing anything like that. I'm barely making any difference to my own family's life or my staff's life. But that's my swadharma.\n\nThis is my swadharma. Many, many years ago when I was still very, very novice in this Bhagavad Gita classes and lectures. One thing I realized, I'm at complete ease when I am in this environment. When I'm talking about Bhagavad Gita or learning Bhagavad Gita in the class everywhere else I'm slightly uncomfortable. So that's my swadharma. So Bhagavan says Sreyan swadharmo Viganaha.\n\nIt may not be of much value to others but your good is to act according to your dharma, your swadharma. What is your vasanas? What is your texture of your personality? Paradharmat swanusthitaat. Then others dharma which seems much nobler or well discharged is the translation.

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter three, Karma Yoga, Yoga of Action. All of us realize that we are defined by our actions. You meet a new person, the first thing you do is obviously judge the person by the way he looks and way he dresses and way he talks and way he acts. But the million dollar question we ask is what do you do? And whatever response comes, you will either enhance your judgment about that person or you will reduce the judgment which you have made by just outward appearance. You know, long time ago, when I first joined Chinmaya Mission in Houston, I met a person in a class called Rambhai.\n\nRambhai and Gujarat is a pretty simple name. You know, his name is Rambhai. So well, very old fellow, he looks also very, very modest in conversation also. And he actually came to me, he thought that I was asking some smart questions in the class. So I obviously already had a better judgment of me. I'm making the judgment just based on what he looks like.\n\nAnd then I finally asked Rambha, what do you do? And he said, I'm a structural engineer. And I'm a research engineer, so I don't do normal building structures. I'm basically a researcher. The more I talked to him, I found out the Guy has about three PhDs in structural engineering. He actually was awarded PhD when he was in undergraduate class.\n\nHe was doing his last BE because he found the flaw in the way the structural engineer for the high rise building, like 15 or 80 story building, calculate the structural load. He found the flaw in that theory while he was in undergraduate class. As soon as I heard that, for me, Rambhai became a completely different person. I always remember that when I judge somebody, is he not another Rambhai? So actions we know are very important, but not all the time. We can act appropriately.\n\nEven knowing that my actions will describe me, will define me. We don't really do everything right in our life. So we have gone through the whole chapter about what is right, actions, how the actions work, what is the right way to act. But in the end, the question Came back as Arjuna asked. Even though sometimes I know what is right, but I can't do what is right. Paapam Charati Purushah Papam we have a cultural baggage when we say Papa.\n\nWe consider something sinful in a sense, something only the sinners do. As we have defined in our discussion in Vedanta, that which creates a negative impression on my mind is a Papa. That which binds me more and more to these limitations is a Papa. That which liberates me is Punya. That which puts a positive impression on my mind, which encourages me, inspires me is Punya. That which dejects me and depresses me is Papa.\n\nWhen I'm depressed and go through all that, I'm going through hell. So Papa leads me to hell. So what is it that puts me in this misery of life? Even though sometimes I know this isn't the right thing to do. And most of the time, at least in my life, I can tell you most of the time when I took wrong decisions or did wrong things, I already had the inkling in my heart that this may not be a right thing to do. But we did it anyway.\n\nBecause everybody says it's okay. My mind says if you don't do it you will be left out, whatever it is. But we did it anyway. So you say Atha kena prayuktam papam chalati purushah anit chada viva. He doesn't want to do it, but baladiyo niyojita as if he is guided by. He is limited by some force which is not allowing him to do what he thinks is right.\n\nKamayesha krudhe sarajoguna samudd bhavaha not really a big revelation to us, but still we never associated when we did something wrong, we actually transferred the blame to somebody else right away. I shouldn't have done, but what can I do? Circumstances are like that. I wouldn't have any angry had he not pushed my buttons. So we see we right away transfer the blame to the others and we kind of redeem ourselves. I'm actually a nice guy and I normally don't do that.\n\nBut because of that, therefore we have no chance to improve. What this basically says is you have a chance to improve. You realize what the source of your mistakes. There is a kama isha krudaya. It is your own desire and anger which led you to do what you thought was not really right. Rajoguna samud Babaha we are born out of Rajoguna activity or actions, going back to actions are very important.\n\nI need to how to act. Same activity, if it is not done properly will lead me to desire and anger. Then that will lead me to commit wrong actions. Therefore it is even more important how to do the right actions. So first thing we have seen is do for the greater good. Do without attachment.\n\nThat part is very important. That attachment creates karma and Krodha that attachment created the desire and anger. As you'll learn in the second chapter, the constant thinking of something creates attachment. That attachment then creates desire. Then that desire creates the anger. The same thought is transforming from constant thought to the desire to the anger.\n\nAnd then buddhi nasha. So Bhagavan said kama erudesa mahasana Mahapatma. Once you are overwhelmed by that flow of thoughts, you can't really get out of it and you continue to commit wrong thing. We have seen all the Hindi movies. When he starts with stealing a loaf of bread and then he becomes a great Amitabh Bachchan who is, you know, angry young man. Once you are in that frame of mind and do not know how to get out of will just take you in that.\n\nSo what is it that I knew something is not right and this is right, but I cannot what is it that's clouding my right thinking? So the next verse says dumena abriate vahanihe. Just as the fire is covered by smoke, fire is there, but there is smoke. Where there is a smoke, there is fire. Smoke cannot be there without fire. But I can't see the fire because the smoke smoke is veiling that fire.\n\nYatha darshao malena cha. Just as mirror is covered by dirt, mirror is there. But I can't see the reflection. Anytime you take a shower, if you are in bathroom doesn't have good exhaust, your mirror will be covered with that water vapor. And you won't be able to see it till you wipe it off. Just as the embryo is covered by whatever you call it.\n\nPlacenta, womb, tatha tena idam avrutam. By that this is covered what is that? That wisdom by this what Kamaya krodesa. Three examples are given. As Swamiji says in our scriptures, repetition is not really allowed. Unnecessary repetition not allowed.\n\nTherefore, Bhagavan ved Vyas would give three examples. Just one simple idea. That knowledge is covered veiled by something. It gives that the veiling of various categories. Just as we have seen everything in three categories, veiling is also of three categories. Sattvik, rajastic and tamastic.\n\nThe first is Tume na vriya te bhanehe. Fire is covered by smoke, but it's very thin veil. A little breeze will remove that smoke and you will see the fire. It's like a sattvic veiling. My desire to do good for the society, my desire to do good for my family, I may get trouble for that, but there was sattvic desire. And then when I realize that society really doesn't need my help or I'm not capable of doing it, that desire will go away.\n\nThat's still availing. Sattva still binds you. By the happiness it gives you. The sattvic desires are still bonded, the golden chain, but still a chain. But it can be removed easily with little knowledge, little brushing up of what is right and wrong, it can go away. The next, just that dust covers the mirror.\n\nThis is a rajasic desire. I want to achieve this, I want to acquire this. Those don't go away with little breeze. You literally need some physical actions to remove the dust from the mirror. It requires a little more effort. You have to really have the resolve that I need to get out of this desire.\n\nThen only you can get out of it. Just by shining a little knowledge. Coming to Gita class Sunday morning doesn't take away Monday morning. I need to get that because it's a Yatha Darsho Malayana. So it's a rajastic desire which is veiling my knowledge of what, what to do and what not to do, what is right and what is wrong, what is truth and what is untruth, what is permanent and what is temporary. That wisdom which I have is veiled by this desire.\n\nItha Ublena, Bruto Gharbaha, we know all the women now at least the man only can infer that how difficult it is for the embryo to mature and come out. It's not something which is done lightly. It takes its own maturity. And then whatever the pain you have to go through to reveal what the truth is, which is the baby. So when my desires are tamasic for the sensual pleasures, then those do not, even with firm resolve, just goes away. It really requires a long term discipline which you have to mature yourself out of that.\n\nA child cannot get rid of their desire to play with toys. He has to mature out of that. So those are more stronger desires which you just have to give it time, let the nature take its own course. Just like as we said, how do the animals evolve? And Swami Purushadama told me on the lap of Mother Nature they don't do any karma so they don't have any Papa or Punya. They don't have any baggage of this is right and this is wrong.\n\nMother Nature gradually takes care of them. So if you are in that category, let the time take its own course. Let the Bhagavan take care of it. Tena idam Avrutam that Kamayesha Krodhayasa is veiling this knowledge. Next was now defined what this and that is Avrutam Gnanam Etena Gnanino Nitya Vayrina Even a wise person's knowledge and for all practical purpose. Vedanta says we are all wise people.\n\nActually at the core of our being we know we are sat chit Ananda. But this wailing is stopping me to realize that. So Avrutam Gnanam this knowledge which is instinctively mine that who I am is veiled by Nitya Vereena. These constant enemies which are present in my mind Kamaru pena kaun the analayana cha this constant enemy present in my mind in the form of Kamarupa in the desire no matter how hard I try to get peace of my mind and we constantly sing my gimme vaidauri Santi Apnea Santi is what we are looking for all our life. But Santi we never got. Because this constant enemy is right there.\n\nHe's not leaving me alone. Other enemies, you can leave them but this enemy is within you. It's not something which you can fulfill one time and you're done with it. So desire is like that. It's not that the one time you fulfill desire and you're done with it. Duspurena Insatiable.\n\nThe fire you can put little ghee and say now we are done with it more you put ghee more it. So in other words, this is a losing battle for us. We already know that more I feed my desire, more it going to flare up.",

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 3, Karma Yoga, Yoga of Action. In Chapter 2, Bhagavan had given us indication about who we are at the core of our being. That the self that I think I am is not the Self, but my self is imperishable, everlasting, all knowing and ever blissful. And it is contrary to my own experience. So it becomes a hypothesis for me. It's not my knowledge right now that the self is all pervading, everlasting, ever blissful.\n\nMy life is completely contrary to that. So Bhagawan says, that's because of your ignorance about yourself. So once I remove that ignorance, then I should be able to know the knowledge. That's basically our hypothesis right now. But my effort to know that is not very fruitful so far. So we have to accept that there is a limitation for me to know.\n\nEven all Western scholars and philosophers have come to the conclusion that there is a limit for the rational thinking to get knowledge. Immanuel Kant said, I have to limit my reasoning to make room for faith that there is God or there is a Creator of this universe. And you can postulate a theory, but it does not become my knowledge. You have to rely on faith. Our scriptures say you don't really have to rely on just faith, but you can experience that if you follow certain path, then you will be able to know this. In fact, our scripture says it is your birthright to know this knowledge.\n\nAnd you will know that when not guaranteed. So you have to make efforts. Efforts means activity, and activity as we know, has its own limitation. So in the beginning of this chapter, having been taught by Bhagavan Karmani, Eva di Karaste Mahphale Shukadachana, your right is only to act, never the fruits of actions. And therefore Yogastha kuru Karmani, establish yourself in yoga and then do your actions and you shall come to know this knowledge. But Arjuna obviously was not convinced that this activity is going to get me anywhere.\n\nSo obviously he asked that question. If you think then I have to establish Myself in yoga which is basically sit down, meditate and become a yogi. Then why are you asking me to engage in this war which is a terrible act? Why don't you tell me the act and can lead me to a greater understanding? So Bhagavan basically clarifies that Lokhi Asmin Duvidanishta Pura Praktamayana God in this world, the two paths are created right from the beginning. Gnana Yogina Sankhyana Karma Yogina Yogina for people with Sankhya Buddhi for the contemplative intellect.\n\nFor them it is Gnana Yoga to contemplate on this fact that I am not this body, I am not this mind, I am not the intellect. Then who I am is basically Gnan Yoga and Karma Yogini Yoginam. Those who are active in this life. For them, Karma Yoga. So basically, Bhagavan transformed Karma into Karma Yoga. And we have seen that Bhagavan has given five pointers.\n\nTwo we get in chapter two. You should not have the fruit in your mind as the goal for your action and establishing Yoga. Perform your all actions. Bhagwan says there are two parts. But for you Karma Yoga is good. Where you are in the station of your life, Karma Yoga will be much better.\n\nThere are three paths we typically talk about. Karma Yoga, Gnana Yoga and Bhakti Yoga. Karma and Gnana I have control over. At least I can make my efforts in them. Bhakti I can only get by God's grace. To fall in love is not something in my hand.\n\nWhen you fall in, there is no choice in love. Bhakti is love for divine and it is choiceless. It only comes by the grace of God. Therefore Bhagawan said, start with Karma Yoga. That Karma Yoga will lead you to knowledge about God. The Bhagavan said, activity is involuntary for all beings.\n\nNakastyatthyanama PI Jatutisthatiya Karmakrut. But you should act in this world by controlling your senses and without any attachment. So Bhagavan said, when the Prajapati created this Praja, he also created Yajna at the same time. To sustain this Praja, the Yajna was created. So we worry about our children. How would they sustain themselves when we are not there?\n\nSo we have to make them independent. How do you make them independent? By this education you shall earn your living. So focus on your education. That's how we do as parents. Prajapati did something Similar, Prajapati created Yajna, cooperative activity where you work with the nature.\n\nThis cooperation between the beings in nature will yield results which will sustain this praja. So then we have seen a cycle in this Prakriti Annad Bhavati Bhutani, Prajanyatamna Sambhavah. And in the end says Karma Brahmod Bhav that the unit of this cycle is action. All that is happening in this Prakriti is happening because of activity in the Prakriti. And this activity is only possible at an individual level. At an individual level, if we act, then this activity becomes a communal activity, a national activity, a global activity.\n\nBut at an individual level you have to act. Then Bhagavan said, this ability to act comes from that Brahman, the supreme consciousness which is functioning through you. As long as I'm alive, I can act. So Bhagavan said, know that this activity is based in your consciousness and therefore you continue activity without any attachment. Because activity is to acquire something I don't have and preserve what I have. But if I come to a conclusion that I have acquired everything I want, should I continue to act?\n\nFor the Loka Sangra, for the preservation of the community, of the society, of this universe, you have to continue working. Look, I have nothing to gain, but I continue to work. If I don't act or work, then there will be a chaos in this cosmos. To avoid this chaos, the Sankarasyacha Kartashyam I will become the cause for this chaos in this world and therefore I continue to work. And then he comes to his final advice in verse 30 where he says, Mai Sarvani Karmani Sanyasya Adhyatma Chet Nirasi Nirmama Bhutva yudhiya, you offer all your actions to me. In this one verse, Bhagavan has given us a complete method of Karma Yoga.\n\nAct you must but act in a manner of Karma Yoga. Now what is Karma Yoga? He said, when you act with that attitude that I'm offering all my actions to the Supreme Lord. Because we have seen in that natural cycle that acts, activity at my level is only possible because I am a conscious being. That life in me, that consciousness in me is not different than the consciousness which is all pervading. Therefore I should offer all my activities to that supreme consciousness.\n\nNirasi nirmamu vatva without any desire for a particular result from my actions. And Nirma not thinking anything is Mine, even this ability to act is not my own. This ability to act is God's gift to me. I did not do much to prepare that this type of body. I will have this type of mind, I will have this intellect developer. Well, this was given to me as my instrument and I'm now just using them.\n\nIf I have a better equipment than some other person, it's not something that I have done something in this life at least. So Bhagavan said, nirasi Nirmammo Bhatva, you become desireless and without any sense of agency that this is mine. Therefore, you should act according to your own dharma. Whatever, wherever you are, whatever the station you are at in your life, you should act according to that. Because you don't really have any choice but to act according to that. I can't suddenly wake up one morning and say, I really don't want to act as an architect anymore.\n\nYou know, this business is not doing well for me. I'm going to become something else. Well, I don't really have an ability to change right away. So Bhagavan said, Swadharma Nidhanam, Sreyaha Paradharmo Bhya Vah, you act according to your own dharma, according to your own Prakriti. Because to act like someone else is very dangerous. It may seem easy right now, it may seem glamorous right now, but because it is not your nature, you will fail eventually and you will not make any progress.\n\nSo therefore, he said, even a wise person is also bound by his own Prakriti. When a wise person is not free from his own nature, he also acts according to his own nature. Except that he does not consider that as his own nature. He considers this the nature of my body, mind and intellect. I offer all that I do to the Lord who is making me do that. You are bound by the Prakriti because you are part of Prakriti.\n\nYour Prakriti is basically who you are at this point and therefore know your nature and act accordingly. In Arjuna's case, he said, you are a Kshatriya. You are a prince who is responsible to protect others. And now you are in front of this enemy army. Your job is to fight this war. In whatever station of life I am in, I should act accordingly.\n\nPrakriti works by likes and dislikes. I have created the likes and dislikes by my experiences in the world of objects. Some experience say I like, some ideas. These likes and dislikes reside in my senses. In my sense perception. Sense perception was pleasurable.\n\nPerception was painful. They are your obstructions and therefore avoid them. If that is the case, just tell me what is the force which makes people commit sins against their own will? Knowing this is not right, I commit that act and then I come to suffer for it. So Bhagavan said, Kama Esha Crudha esha. In the end it came down to My likes and dislikes are the root cause of how I act.\n\nIf I overcome my likes and dislikes then it will be much easier for me to act in a rational manner. Why I have not been able to do that is because of the Kama and Krodha. This likes and dislikes create desire. That desire creates anger. This Kama is the root cause of all my problems. So Bhagavan said, therefore consider them to be your enemies.\n\nThis desire and anger are veiling my true nature. We started a journey from I do not know my true self and therefore all my problems in life. If I know my true self, I'll be almighty, all pervading, omniscient, omnipresent. That knowledge has been veiled by this Kama and Krodha. Therefore Bhagavan said Avrutam Gnana Methina. Now this Gnana is the Gnana of myself.\n\nAvruttam Gnanameti na Gnanino Nitya Vairina bhai. This knowledge is veiled from even a wise person. Kama Rupena kaunteya duspuraynanalynacha Kama desire. It is insatiable like a fire. And therefore Bhagavan says Indriyani Manobuddhi adhishthanamuchate. If they enemy have to find his location.\n\nThe location of my enemy is Indriyani Manah Buddhi Senses, mind and intellect are this desire's residences. I identified where this desire resides. It deludes the embodied by veiling his wisdom. A simple fact Bhagavan said is this desire is veiling your wisdom about your own self. And therefore this desire is your enemy. The desire is residing in your senses first by the sense perception.\n\nThis perception creates the conception of that object and then I have desire to acquire that object. If I can't acquire the object of my desire then I'm angry. This desire and anger is veiling your true self. And therefore Tasmat Indriyani Adav Niyamya Bharata Sabha. Don't let this enemy come into your house. Once it enters your house, you are in trouble.\n\nTherefore you have to lock your doors, have a security system.",
      "reflection": "Choose one action today—any action—and practice doing it with full attention but without attachment to results. Whether it's sending an email, having a conversation, or completing a task, offer it as best you can and then release your grip on the outcome.\n\nNotice what happens when you work this way. Is there more freedom? More presence? More energy? The Gita's teaching of Karma Yoga isn't about becoming passive or indifferent. It's about working with full engagement while remaining internally free.\n\nAsk yourself: Where in my life am I most attached to results? What would change if I could offer my best effort and then surrender the outcome?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter four, Gnana Karma Sannyasa Yoga Yoga of Renouncing Karma in Knowledge. We have completed discussion on chapter three, Karma Yoga. In Karma Yoga we have seen how to act in this world so that we are not bound by our actions. But our goal actually in life is to become actionless, to retire from my activity. So if somebody says, why Neil, you are working so hard now I am working hard to become actionless in my retirement and how do I want to achieve that? If I can become financially independent so that I don't depend on the outside income, as long as I'm dependent on outside income, I have to keep working.\n\nSomebody have to generate income from outside. So I'm continuing to work. The harder I work, obviously the more conflicts I create and more situation which makes me unhappy. More I think I'm controlling the situation. The situation controls me. So what I want to do is to create a situation where I don't have to work with the outside world for my well being.\n\nThat's what we call it, a retirement. So that's why we have this 401k and IRA and all of that. That will make me independent. Once I'm financially independent, I don't depend on my outside income, then I can do what I want. Every year I took a cruise and I realized that most of the population of the Cruise is above 55. 80% of the people were senior citizens.\n\nSo all the programs were geared towards senior citizens. So I was actually pitying all the young people who were there like in minority. I want to do what I want to do. So the goal is always to be actionless, that I don't want to interact with this world. In last chapter we learned exactly same thing for all these activities it says Yahatu Atmaratiyeva, Everyone has duty to act in this world according to their own dharma, according to the roles they are playing. It comes with all the Niyata Karma, all these ordained duties.\n\nSo you have to continue doing your duties. But there is Only one exception. One who is atmaratihi who is reveling in himself. He's not dependent on anything or anybody outside to be happy. Atmatruptastamaanava who is self content. If I'm reveling in myself, I'm self content.\n\nAtmani evacha santushtaha tasya kariyam na vidyaday the only time you have no duty to act, to do any work or any action is when you meet this condition. Atmaratehe full of yourself. Not a right way to put it back. So you have no real need to depend on outside world. Once you are not depending on outside world, there is no question for having a conflict with the outside world. It's only we are dependent on them.\n\nWhen we have conflict. I am dependent on my employees. My employees are dependent on me. We constantly have conflict. You are not coming on time. You didn't do what I thought I was going to be doing.\n\nHe feels the same way. Neil, you are not doing what I thought you were going to do for me. Because we are dependent on each other. If I am not dependent on them. We have projected Dominion and it's really going not anywhere because we are updating the auditorium. And the CEO of the company will be the first meeting there on 23rd.\n\nAnd the project is supposed to be complete end of March. It is not completed now. We don't know whether it's going to complete on the 23rd. So often hours because the CEO is going to be there, they call me up, they call everybody. Obviously we blame everybody else contracted into this. Why did you specify Neil?\n\nSomething which comes from Japan, all this good stuff. So I asked the guys, did you always have this problem? The guy who's in charge at Dominion, he said the only time I don't have problem is I don't depend on anybody. When I do work myself, that's my problem too. I have to depend on the contractor. I have to depend on you.\n\nWe all know for sure. Then when I don't have depend on other people, then I'm free. He has no employees to worry about. His structural engineer, he was a one man firm and did very well. Because he's not dependent on his employees. He knows what he can do, what he cannot do and he can promise accordingly.\n\nOn my case, I have to depend on 15 other people when I promise what they're going to do. So in our life we have figured out that the only way to be free is not to be dependent on anybody. At the same token, my happiness right now is mortgage with this world outside. They determine whether I can be happy or not. So Bhagawan said that the goal of life is to become actionless. I'll become actionless when I'm not dependent on others for my happiness.\n\nSo we learn that Yahatu Atmaratihiva, one who is reveling in himself, atmatrupta satisfied by his own self, atmaniyevacha Santustah is content by himself. Then he does not have to do anything. But the same token, I have to continue to work in this world. So I need to understand what is the way I can stop acting. And this chapter, the title says Gnana Karma Sannyasa. When the knowledge occurs, what is happiness?\n\nWhat is that I'm seeking? Then all actions I can renounce. So now we are further taking our discussion on actions to next level. We understood that I need to act in a manner that I'm not attached to the actions. And also I should be acting in a way that it is good for everyone, that is for the greater good. Then I will not be bound by my actions.\n\nBut how do I reach to that point? I need to have the knowledge. My actions without knowledge obviously are not producing the result which I need to produce. So the next level of discussion in the actions is now how do you achieve that state where I have the knowledge? So the chapter titled Gnana Karma Sannyasa Yoga Bhagawan doesn't even wait for Arjuna to ask any question. He comes out and gives him his version of what we're going to do next.\n\nSri Bhagavanu Vacha Imam Vivasvate Yogam proktavan Aham Avyam Vivasvaan Manavai Praha Manohu Isvakave Abravit said, I'm now going to teach you the yoga which is imperishable. That knowledge has never become outdated. We used to learn something probably in last century about driving a horse buggy. In this century we are learning how to drive car. It will become invalid pretty soon if these guys are all successful. We used to put a lot of emphasis on handwriting, at least architecture.\n\nOur whole life in the architecture school was how nicely I can write. It's called architectural script. We spent all our life to perfect our handwriting. Nobody writes anymore. You can't differentiate my drawing from anybody else. We used to take great pride in that.\n\nEven if there is work left and there Is no enough time. Somebody says, can I help you, Neel? I want to make sure that nobody else handwriting is on my drawing. Because once somebody says, oh, that's Neil's drawing. I don't want somebody's handwriting on it. But now all drawings look same, no matter where it come from because it's computer.\n\nSo the skills which we were learning, which was so dear to us is no more valid. But one said this yoga is not like that, it's universal. It was always valid in the past, it's valid now and it will be valid forever. Ivam Vivasvate Yogam Proktava vyam I taught this yoga to Vivaswan and then Vivaswan Manavai Prah Vivaswan then taught in turn to the Manu. The Manu in dint taught to Manu Isva kavet. He is now making sure that you understand that this is not something I just made up suddenly.\n\nThis is an imperishable yoga. This knowledge is imperishable. It's applicable at any given age. So it starts with that. This knowledge is so ancient. It starts with the beginning of this creation.\n\nIn our world, the creation started with Sun. We at least know from our high school science that this earth came out of Sun. And then obviously all the development in the earth is because of that solar energy. So our source at our level is Sun. We don't have to go any further than that. So he said, even when the sun was created, this knowledge was there.\n\nSo Vivaswani son I the Lord the first time, as Swamiji says, Krishna comes out as I am the Lord. In this conversation, the Creator, the knowledge giver is saying, this knowledge always available from the beginning of this creation. So I gave it to the first created entity, the Sun. That son gave it to his son, which is Manu. From our puranic point of view, Viva Swan was the original entity. The Manu has his son and then the whole progeny starts and we end up here.\n\nIn this class I taught to Lord sun who is the originator of our world. Then he in turn taught to his sons. Obviously we always pass on our knowledge from us to our children. That's why we start teaching the little kids. And yesterday we were in the park and Medha always like to swing. The only way to stop her is say we're going to count one to hundred.\n\nSo in 100 you have to come down. That's okay, we start 1, 2. And she said no, we're going to count in Spanish. So she starts in uno dwe. Okay, after that what? Meda after that what?\n\nBecause she has to tell us now. She knows because of the Dora they explorer. So we teach our children what we know. So Bhagavan said that Lord's son taught to his sons what he knew, this imperishable yoga. Then Manu in turn taught to his son. So Ishvaku, Ishwaku, we all know from Ramayana is the ancestor of Rama of the Sun Dynasty.\n\nSun Dynasties came from whether we like this historically or not. But that's how the Purana describe how our lineage is. The point here is very simple. Right from the beginning of our ancestry, this knowledge was available to people. And those people passed on from one generation to another through the leaders of the society. The leaders obviously in those days were kings.\n\nThey were the people who were leading the society. So if you read historically that Manu led these people from wherever they were to the land which was more safer and fertile. Actually the professor Bargha, he said that Noah is same as Manu because in Sanskrit Manu is Manu hu. The people in the Arabic world only put nu. They drop the ma and nu, then nu in the western world become Noah. So if you read the story of the Noah's Ark, very similar to what we have in Amapurana, the Great Flood.\n\nSo we know that there's some connection somewhere where some ancestor left some land which was not very conducive and was flooding all the time. Well, let's go to somewhere. So he led his people to this. So he's our ancestor Manu Adi Manu. And whether he was the first human being is left to your imagination. We know for sure that he was the first Aryan king in this lineage of the Aryan kings who ruled Arya worth for ages.\n\nSo he said the first person to know this knowledge in this lineage, Manu. Manu in turn will give it to his sons. He came to Ishwaku who was the ancient king of Solar dynasty.",
      "reflection": "Today, look for 'action in inaction'—moments when apparent stillness conceals profound inner activity. And look for 'inaction in action'—moments when busy-ness masks inner stagnation.\n\nWhere in your life is genuine transformation happening? Where are you just going through the motions? The wise person sees beyond the surface appearance of action and inaction to the truth beneath.\n\nReflect on the teaching that God Himself works ceaselessly for the welfare of the world, though He has nothing to gain. What would it mean for you to work with that same spirit—fully engaged, yet free from personal agenda?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter four, Gnana Karma Sannyasa Yoga Yoga of Denouncing actions in Knowledge. So so far we have learnt in Bhagavad Gita that the sole goal of any being is happiness. And happiness we have seen is defined as absence of unhappiness. As long as there is unhappiness somewhere, I cannot be happy. Just like as we have seen, the cold is defined as absence of heat is cold. Darkness is defined as absence of light is darkness.\n\nHappiness is defined by lack of unhappiness. So my true nature is actually happiness. But the infusion of unhappiness creates this state which I call it going back from happiness to unhappiness. Happiness and unhappiness. When there is no unhappiness, I am happy. No matter how many other things are getting well in my life, it just won't let me focus on that.\n\nIn Sastra it's called Kakadrasti. A crow is flying over a garden and everything else is beautiful underneath. But crow is not focusing on all the beautiful flowers. He is focused on a Caracas which is lying in that garden. That's where he goes. So our Kakadra stays.\n\nWe don't focus on what is right in our life, we focus on what is wrong in our life. So we have to get out of this habit of seeing what is not right in my life. So what we try to do is keep searching for happiness rather than avoiding unhappiness. The search of happiness leads us to believe that my actions will get me to happiness. So we act in this world to achieve happiness which is already with us. But these actions also lead me to results which are unhappiness.\n\nSo therefore we have seen in last chapter, Arjuna's question is Atha KE na prayuk toyam Papam Charati Purusha. There is no one in this life who really wants to become unhappy. And still we end up becoming unhappy by our own actions. So the actions are at the root cause of whether I'm happy or unhappy. So therefore we need to understand what the actions are all about. So the one thing we learnt is I can live without actions because actions is the very nature of my own being.\n\nNature is part of Prakriti. It is one of the attributes of Prakriti is action Rajas. And as I am part of Prakriti, as this body, mind, intellect is part of Prakriti, action is a very signature of my being who I am. So actions I cannot avoid that's given. Now how can I avoid actions which gives me unhappiness? Well again, when I am performing actions, there is not a single action I perform because I want to be unhappy.\n\nWell, let me do something that makes me unhappy. Let's see how it feels like. There is no curiosity about unhappiness. I really don't want to know. But I still end up being unhappy. That because I'm not understanding what accents are all about.\n\nSo we learnt in chapter three what accents are all about. The first thing we learnt is Yajnaarthaat Karmano, Nyatra Loko Yam Karma, Bandanaha. All accents are binding. If they are not performed for the Yajna for the spirit of common good, then it is binding. If I am doing it for myself, they are binding. When those actions are binding, I'll be bound by the results.\n\nIn a sense, I really don't know what the results would be. They may come back as conducive results and I'll be happy or they come back as unconducive results and I'll be unhappy. So now I am in a conundrum. I want to act because that's what's going to make me happy. But also I'm not quite confident that my actions will make me happy. Because I have no control over my actions.\n\nSo there got to be a way to get out of this conundrum of acting and reacting and then acting again. So Bhagavan said yes, there is a yoga, the Yoga of Knowledge. Once the knowledge takes place that I am not the actor, you will be released from this bondage of actions. Because you are not performing the actions, you cannot be bound by it. So that is Gnana Karma Sannyasa Yoga. Yoga of renouncing actions in knowledge.\n\nWhen knowledge takes place that I am not the actor. Guna Gunesuvartantaha Ithimatva na Sajjadhai. We learned that in chapter three. Once I figure out that the actions are only taking place in the Prakriti level by my qualities, qualities of my body Mind and intellect and qualities of rest of the universe. When they come in contact with each other, they react with each other. When they are two independently standing, there is no water.\n\nWhen they come together, they create water. We also work in this world the same way. By ourselves we are not reacting to anything. As soon as we come in contact with another being or an object, we react. There was sometimes we had good chemistry with him. What do you mean good chemistry?\n\nI like him with no reason. Guna Gunesuvaratanta. I detect Gunas in him or her. Maybe a physical, mental, intellectual, something which I like. I tell people how I got into hotel designing business. Very first limited hotel.\n\nI had designed full service hotels in my life before I came to Virginia. But then I was looking for some work. Somebody says there is an Indian community. They design lot of mid level hotel. He said no, no, you're a big time, not small time. So the first guy they introduced me was in Charlottesville.\n\nHow about they said let me come down there. Because one thing I figured out, I can win people over if I'm in front of them on phone and writing. But if I'm in front of him I can probably have a better chance. So let me come down there. So I go down there, talk to the guy and then he said, you know, where are you from? But where in Vijay says Surat.\n\nMy parents actually come from Randeh. Oh, where is Randeir? In the end of the day we never talked about what do I know about architecture. They said you are my architect now because your ancestors come from Randir. Let the architecture sort out by itself. You are my architect.\n\nSomething we find common. So therefore these actions are all bound by Gunas. But we consider it to be ours. The Bhagawan said that one who is understanding this he will not be attached to his actions. He doesn't get attached. But how do I get to that point that I don't get attached.\n\nI have to have knowledge who I am. So this chapter starts with Bhagavan said that I taught this yoga to Vivaswan. Then the Viva swan taught to Manu. Then Manu taught to Iksvaku. And thus by lineage the knowledge was passed on to generation to generation. But now because the long time has passed the knowledge is lost.\n\nWhen was Vivaswan and Manu and you are now telling me that you taught them. And we have discussed that Vivaswan and Manu from a genealogical point of view we know that they are Krishna's ancestors. Vivaswan's son was Manu who time of Pralaya saved his family and seven Rishis. And then Manu's descendants. Manu's son was Ikswaku. So Vivaswan taught his son Manu.\n\nManu taught his son Ishvaku. And Isvaku we know is Rama's ancestor who established the kingdom in Ayodhya. And somewhere about 36 generations Rama comes. One of them was the ancestor of Krishna. Somewhere in 60th generation Krishna comes. They say you are telling me that you are teaching all your ancestors even if you don't consider Vyvaswana son.\n\nSo then Bhagavan said Bahuni me Vyati Thani Janmani Stavacharjuna Tani Aham Veda Sarwani Natvam Vedaparam Tapa. This is not the only life that you and I know, Arjuna. You know me in this life as Krishna. But I have taken so many births before and so did you. The only difference is I know them all. This is a very bold presentation of concept of reincarnation.\n\nIt was not that it was not introduced before. It was introduced in chapter 2. Vasamsi Jinini Yatavi Haya Navani Guru Nathi Naroparani we have already seen that this self is immutable, imperishable. It just takes one state of existence to another depending on. We know from our study of Bhagavadya by Karma actions. Our actions create experiences in this world.\n\nThese experiences create tendencies. These tendencies create likes and dislikes and desires. And to fulfill those desires we take a next state of existence. My desire was to become a rock star. Then obviously I learned music and then march on that path. So desire leads us to where we are today.\n\nBut you see, we won't remember how we got here. But the one who is very aware of this transitory nature of things he will remember all of them. See, some of us are very good at remembering dreams. But all of us remember dreams, right? Some of my dreams even I had in childhood, I still remember. Either still scares me or still fascinates me.\n\nBut I don't remember all my dreams. Let's assume that if I was so enlightened about keeping connected myself to my dream world then I would know all my dreams See, right now I'm only connected to my waking world. And sporadically I'm connected to my dream world. So I remember some dreams here and there, but not all of them waking world. I think I remember everything. Then somebody says, but Neil, you did this?\n\nNo, I don't remember. I forget almost everything she says I did. She said you did this for some reason. Women are very historical. They remember everything. From the day I met Meena till today she remembers everything that I did not do right?\n\nAnd I don't remember any of that. But you remember what she didn't do, right? So we have very, what you call it is a convenient memory. But at least I'm connected to the waking world. If I'm disconnected, then I will have to have psychiatric evaluation because I don't remember who I am and all the good stuff. If you imagine as I'm connected to waking, well, if I'm also connected to my dream world, then also my deep sleep, then I will remember everything.\n\nBut for that I have to be a third party not involved in it. So soon that there is recording device which is recording everything which is going in my brain. It will record everything. See, that's why when we see some of the recordings of our own childhood, we get fascinated. Did I look like that? So we have a memory which is very specific to time and space.\n\nThe time and space we are in. This is what remember as the reality. But if there is some way we can connect all our realities then we will have a complete view. Bhagawan said that you and I both have the capability to know that. But because of ignorance that who I am has created smaller memory. More I identify with the localized situation.\n\nMore I will forget about my greater situation. Some of my friends still writes me every year and I have forgotten most of them because my nature is to wherever I am now I'm in Richmond. These are my friends and my family. More I identify with Richmond. More I'll forget my friends in Northern Virginia and Houston and Nairobi and Zambia and India. But some people keep remain connected because they never belong to where they are.\n\nThey may ask somebody and say, what are you doing? We go to Northern Virginia every weekend. We have all our friends there. They are not connected here, they are more connected there.",

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter four, Gnana Karma Sannyasa Yoga, Yoga of Renunciation of Action in Knowledge. We have seen so far that in chapter three, Bhagavan has taught Arjuna Karma Yoga. In that he said that you should perform actions for Yajna Yajnarth Puru Karmani. Then he also said, asaktah Sattattam Karma Samajaraha. Perform all your actions without attachment. And he said, yogastha Guru Karmani, establish your Sulmi Yoga and they perform your actions.\n\nSo these are the three requisites or three path. Three ways of performing actions Bhagavan has indicated to Arjuna and he called it Karma Yoga. How you can continue performing your actions in this world as required by roles you are taken. The art of performing action called Karma Yoga. Bhagavan Seth was taught to the royal sages, the philosopher kings, right from the beginning. Right from the beginning of the creation.\n\nThis knowledge was given to Lord sun, who is considered to be in this case, the original ruler of this universe. He then gave it to his successor. His successor gave it to his successor. And this knowledge was passed on one royal sage to the another, one philosopher king, to another philosopher king. You know, kings were not just simply the rulers, but they were also established in Dharma. They were established in the knowledge.\n\nBut this knowledge was lost over a period of time. And therefore I have given it to you again today, and you shall also be able to use it. But then Arjuna asked, how can that be possible? Because you are under my contemporary, how you could give this knowledge to Lord Son. And in that response we all learned how the reincarnation works. So Bhagavan said, bahuni me vyati Thani Janma ne tava Charjana.\n\nOh Arjuna, you and I have gone through many, many Janmas, many, many iterations of our existence. The only difference, he is saying that I know them all and you do not know any. That's because you take birth. I, as a Jiva, take birth, compelled by my own vasanas. My unfulfilled desires. I take a new instrument to fulfill my vasanas which I have not fulfilled yet.\n\nIf I have no vasanas, no desires, there is no reason for me to take birth. In other words, there is no action required if there is no desire. I don't need to buy a car if I am never going to travel. People in New York City, most of them don't buy car because they are not going to use car. It's not economical for them to bike. They don't need that equipment.\n\nPeople like us, we need that equipment. Because there is only way we can travel from one place to another. We have desire to travel. The equipment needed is a car. Therefore, I'll buy a car. In the same way you are driven by your own vasanas, take another birth.\n\nBut in my case, there is no need for me. But I take birth by my own free will because I have a desire. And that is what Bhagavan has basically said. Why he takes that divine birth. He said, yada yada hi dharmasyagnanir Bhavati Bharata abyuthanam adharmashya tad atmanam srujami ham. The desire may be noble, it may be good or bad.\n\nBut unless there is desire, there cannot be any action swimming in Bhagavan's part also from Ishwara's point of view also he has a desire to set the creation right. When he sees that the Dharma is declining in his own creation, as we have seen in Vedantic discussions, then Bhagavan creates this universe out of his own self. The Creator is the efficient cause, knows how to create. He also knows how to maintain it. But the material he used to create this universe, his own self, he has created this universe out of his own self. So he is all pervading in this universe.\n\nAnd he has created this universe out of his own will. Maya when he sees that his own creation, there is a decay of Dharma. Dharma we have seen in several discussions before is the law of being. That which makes a thing or a being what it is is its Dharma. If that Dharma is declining, a thing or being is not functioning as it should be, then it needs to be corrected. So here Bhagavan said, when in the society, just as an individual has a Dharma, the society also has a Dharma.\n\nHuman beings have their own Dharma. At the basic core level, a human being is a rational animal. He differentiated from all other animals as his reasoning power. So he can act rationally, he can think rationally. If human beings stop acting rationally, then Dharma is decayed. If they start acting irrationally, I will say Dharma is decayed for human beings, for that society.\n\nSo it's been current condition, the Dharma of democracy is that everyone has the right to vote or right to give opinion. When that Dharma is violated, then democracy is decayed and somebody has to come and correct it. So in this case, Bhagavan said, whenever there is a decay of Dharma, when I see that things are not performing as per Dharma, then it has to be replaced, corrected, and the order should be restored. So to give you an example from my own observation, a Dharma of a steel beam under a bridge is to provide the tensile strength to that bridge. Because that beam can bend and come back to its own position that the Dharma was steel. When the steel is corroded, it's still steel, but it's corroded steel.\n\nThat steel does not have the tensile strength which was required by that beam. And therefore it needs to be either repaired or replaced. So in that case, whoever is the owner of that bridge, responsible for that bridge, he may be paying no attention to that beam. But now that he has observed that the decay, there's a danger of breach to collapse. Well, he has to manifest himself as the corrector for that steel beam. So he said, yada yada, hi Dharma Siglanir Bhavati.\n\nWhenever Dharma has decayed, that things or beings are not acting according to their own Dharma. Abhiuthana Madharma and the rise of Adharma Adharma, which is contrary to his own Dharma. Human beings are supposed to be rational. They are not acting rationally. They are no different than any other animals. Society has to be just.\n\nIf the society is not just, obviously it is not a society. If there is a chaos in the society, whoever is responsible for their society has to restore the order in the society. It becomes a just society again. Bhagawan said, that is my desire when I take birth by my free will. So we have seen that we are under the spell of Maya. Therefore, we are deluded by ignorance.\n\nIgnorance is veiling my own self. I do not see who I am. I continue to change my vehicle from this body to another. But that's driven by my vasanas. For Ishwara in control of Maya. The whole creation is created by his own Maya out of his own self.\n\nWhen he sees this creation, he is not performing as per his design. He has the desire to set it right. Paritranaya Sadhunam Vinashaya Chaduskritam, Dharma, Sansthapa, Narthaya, Sambhavami, Yuge Yuge. Time and again I manifest myself as one of my own creation and then set the order correct so that the things which are working as per Dharma are protected, and those which are not acting according to Dharma, they either to be corrected, rehabilitated, or replaced. So in the same example of my steel beam under a bridge, there are several steel beams under that bridge. Those are providing the tensile strength to that bridge.\n\nPeople don't pay much attention. Corroded beams we see all the time. When we see extensive corrosion under that bridge, then whoever is in charge of that say, we need to do something. Well, let's figure out which beams we can restore and which we have to replace so that the overall strength of that bridge, by the collective strength of all the steel beams is restored back to where it should have been. Dharmasansthapa Narthaya for society to function as it was supposed to have functioned, as the just society, then I have to come and restore order, remove those who are poisonous, who cannot be rehabilitated, rehabilitate those who can be rehabilitated, so that those who are practicing Dharma are protected and society functions as it supposed to have functioned before the decay started. In verse nine, he says, Arjuna.\n\nHere is another method Bhagavan gives us to achieve that state of knowledge that right now I am under the spell of Maya and my knowledge is veiled by my ignorance. And there are several other methods. We have seen Gina Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Karma Yoga. He said that Karma Yoga, you can perform your actions as we have discussed, or you can just observe a divine person acting in this world selflessly and then recognizing how he does it in his divine manifestation, and then finding the same divinity within you. You will establish yourself in your own self, in your own real self, which is your own atma, your own consciousness. As we have discussed that there is nothing in this world which is not manifestation of Bhagavan, manifestation of Brahman.\n\nAnd therefore you and I cannot be different from Avatara. So in our culture we have this Dasha Avatara, but actually that's just the popular version of it. There are Puranas, have 24 Avataras, some are 36 Avatara. Numerous descriptions of Avatara, because Avatara means the one that descend is Avatara. Avatarati ITI Avatara. You and I also have descended from our highest position of all knowing self to very limited knowing self.\n\nFrom these limitations, I want liberation. Bhagavan said, even by observing others, so we create role models in our life, from them we learn. And if I can create the highest role model which has demonstrated how a person established in his own self acts in this world. Bhagawan said, you can also get liberated just by recognizing how a divine incarnation functions. Janma, Karma, Chame Divyam Evam yo Vittita tv. One who knows in essence what is the purpose of a divine Avatara and how that divine being functions in this world.\n\nTherefore we learn Ramayana, therefore we recite Bhagavad Gita. We are trying to learn from them how Lord Rama acted in his life. If we can understand that Bhagavan says, Then when you give up this body. If I understood in my life how Rama has functioned in his life, what was his motivation to act the way he acted, what was Krishna's motivation to act the way he acted, then I will also find that same self in me by my own contemplation, my own observation of my own self, that this is not me. The demands of my body, my mind, intellect are not really me. I am something other than that.\n\nHaving understood this by learning from my own role models, when I give up this body, I don't have to take the birth again. So Swamiji explains here that in previous descriptions in scriptures, the idea was deathlessness. But then the later portion of our scriptures, the birthlessness is described. The death is obviously something to be afraid of. Therefore don't get infected by coronavirus or social distancing, all of that. But death is the one thing you are worried about.\n\nBut somehow we are going to die anyway if coronavirus or no coronavirus. But the very thought that I will start all over again. I have come all this far from going through learning from ABCD to whatever went through kg, then high school, then college, I have to start all over again.",

      "commentary": "Chapter 4 Gnana Karma Sannyasi Yoga of Ending Karma in Knowledge. We all want to retire, but there is no real practical way to retire. You always do something. You can only retire mentally. So when you don't take your actions to be work, you retire, then you enjoy this. So when we change our mental attitude about our actions, then you retire from the actions.\n\nSo the only way Bhagavan says to end your actions because these actions are binding and I want to get out of this bondage. He said, you have to get rid of your actions. You have to retire from your actions. And the only way to retire is in the knowledge of who you are and what actions are all about. So in chapter three we have seen Karma Yoga and see how to gradually liberate yourself from your actions by changing your attitude towards actions. And now you say, well, how can I then completely relieve myself of this burden is to realize who I am.\n\nSo this chapter talks about what is the nature of the self. Ajaha Pisan Avya Yatman. I yourself, Ajaha Unborn, Avyatma, immutable, imperishable. That's the real nature of mind. Bhutanam Isvaropisan. I am the lord of all beings.\n\nAll beings are beings because of my presence in them. I am who I am and you are who you are. And the donkey is who donkey is. Because that life which is pulsating through them, the presence of that omnipresent self makes people who they are and beings who they are. That's why he is the lord of all the beings. Lordship is someone who has a control over my life is my lord in feudal system.\n\nThe guy who owned the estate was a lord. Even today he's a landlord and a renter. He has the control over your property. Therefore he's a landlord. So he is the Bhutana Mishurabeesan. Prakrutin swam this tyre.\n\nYou and I come into existence because of the Self. But because of the Maya we think we are individual egos, we are the individuals. But someone who has a complete identification with himself, he realizes this is just an appearance. It's just an illusion that I have taken a limited form. So the difference between us and the Avatar is we think we are limited. Avatar knows all the time.\n\nHis role in this life is limited. So Krishna can say, I am unlimited. He knew his role in this life, but he never bound himself with his role. He said that presiding over my prakriti, I come time and again to regulate Dharma. Hi Dharma Siglanir Bhavati. Dharma itself is a self regulating principle.\n\nYou don't really need to do anything about Dharma water. You don't have to train water to seek its own level because it's self regulating. My Dharma is also self regulating. So when I get out of my Dharma, I cease to be what I was. I'll become something else. When I came to this country, there were no jobs for architecture because I came in 82 and there was a recess in time.\n\nSo there were no jobs. So people said, Neil, the best thing you can do. And I was in Houston at the time, so the oil economy was still tail end of it. The best thing, if you can become a pipe designer, pipe drafting, pipe drafting. Pipe drafting is a lot of money. So compared to architecture, you do pipe drafting, all those pipes for the oil company, you will make more money.\n\nAnd I said, no matter how much money there is, I won't be able to do it. That's my Dharma to design building. I can't design pipes. I may have to suffer through unemployment. As long as I don't get a job, I'll do something else. But by very nature, I'm an architect.\n\nI have to design buildings. And then I finally somewhere I worked for some contractor. I think you will do very well if you continue in the contracting. I left the job right away. He is going to deviate me from my Dharma. So what is your Dharma if I stop being an architect or stop designing buildings?\n\nI'm not an architect. It's as simple as that. So Dharma is a self regulating principle. To remain who I am, I have to remain in that Dharma. As soon as I deviate from that Dharma, Dharma itself, eliminate me from that existence, stop practicing architecture, I'll be eliminated from architectural societies, architectural communities, all the architectural duties and responsibilities. I'm not something else.\n\nSo Bhagwan says, yada yada, Hi Dharma Seglani R. Bhavati. In this world, the role is assigned to each things and beings. If they deviate from the Dharma, I will eliminate them. Regulating principle, some agency to do that, I will take Avatara. I will be a catalyst to make the change for those who are deviating from the Dharma. To eliminate from that society, that community, that part of this universe.\n\nAbyutthanam, adharmasyatadhatmanam sujam. When there is a rise of Adharma, a lot of people are thinking that this is Dharma, but actually it's Adharma. So when that happens, when Dharma is misunderstood by beings and people, as the last time we have discussed, it's only for human beings because we have free will that we can deviate from our Dharma. We can be vegetarians and also can be non vegetarians. We don't know whether we were designed as vegetarians or not. Elephant knows he is designed as vegetarian.\n\nLion knows he is designed as carnivore. Because of our free will, we deviate from our Dharma when it becomes unbearable for the society. Swamiji used to say that you also, you know, surjami aham. During springtime, you see, when there are few weeds in your garden, you see, it's okay. You don't pay much attention to it. Then gradually your yard becomes filled with weeds.\n\nThen less grass and more weeds. Then one Sunday, you put on your yard work clothes and say, I need to take care of this. You will tolerate it to a point. Let the weeds have good time. And then one Sunday you say, no, this is it or the protection of the grass. Vina Sahaja duskritam all the way.\n\nSo time and again you, as the Lord will come and set your yard right. Bhagawan said this, in my yard, I have to do the same thing. Paritra Naya Sadhunam Vinasaya. Somebody asked Swamijuman. They say, but if that's the case, why Bhagavan is not coming now? He said, Bhagavan clearly says Paritra Naya, Sadhuna.\n\nIf lesser evil is fighting with greater evil, Bhagavan has nothing to do with it. Let them figure it out how to kill each other. They will eliminate each other automatically. Bhagavan doesn't have to interfere. It is only that evil is not letting the good practice good. Then only Bhagavan comes.\n\nIn our case, it's a lesser evil fighting greater evil. It's still evil in the end. Therefore, he said, Bhagavan doesn't have to come yet. Dharma Sasthapanaarthaya. To establish Dharma again. As I said, it's a self regulating principle.\n\nIt will time and again it will reset Dharma so that the cycle will continue as it was designed. We take our car once in a while for tune up and wheel alignment. We tolerate it to a point. When it starts making noise while you're driving, I need to take it to the garage and calibrate it. So that is a self regulating principle to calibrate itself. Because time and again it gets out of its alignment.\n\nAnd Bhagawan said, I as the self. I created this universe out of my own self, out of my own Maya. And I let it run through its own laws. The laws of nature are self regulating. So we don't have to control whatever the law of gravity and all that. We don't want to get up in the morning.\n\nLet's make sure the law of gravity is working. Otherwise how I'm going to go down to the staircase. Because suddenly if I try to go down, I start flying into the ceiling. So I have to be very conscious that law of gravity is working every day. No, we don't have to. But my own behavior I have to regulate.\n\nBecause I have free will. I can be doing right. I also can be doing wrong. My free will is guided my mind and intellect and my mind and intellect can deceive me in doing something which is not right. I say I should not be doing this. But the mind will put an argument and say no.\n\nOther people are doing it. So what's wrong in it then? Everybody's doing it. Cheating on 1040 because other people are doing it. I come to think that it's okay. But my conscience tell me it's not right.\n\nBut my mind and intellect will say that's okay. And that's what I suffer. So Bhagawan says, that's why I have to time and again rise in your own heart as your own inner voice. If I have few good thoughts which are still trying to direct me toward the right path, but many bad thoughts are avoiding me to exercise my right to follow the good thoughts, then that voice will rise in my heart. Because at least those good thoughts were propelling me to find what is right. So that's what Bhagawan said.\n\nI will rise in your heart as your avatar. And that will redeem you from the Wrong that you are going to do, when will that happen? Janma Karma Chame Divyam evam yo Vidya Takvatah when you will realize that in its essence I am the divine being that this life is divine it given to me for learning to rise out of limitationswarjana. Once I realize what is the real truth, what is my real nature then when I get out of this existence when I exhaust all the vasanas and karmas of this existence I will not take the new Vasana. If last time I have experienced something and that was not really enjoyable I somehow suffered through that experience. But then what will I do next?\n\nI don't want to go there again ever. Because I realized that this is a painful existence. It is when we go back and forth I enjoyed some but suffer some. So let me go for the enjoyment in the bargain I also suffer. So that's why we have Punarabi Janamam Punarapi Maranam because our attachments are taking us back to that existence Even though we suffered through it we forget at times that there will be sufferings also attached to this pleasures. So say but my divine nature is omnipresence and omnipotence he will get out of this Punarjunma.\n\nSo Tektvadeham Punarjunmati Saharjuna he comes to being my own self. So that technique now is given and we have discussed before the root cause is the attachment and its byproducts Raga, Bhaya and Krodha Raga is the root cause byproducts of Bhaya and Krodha Fear and anger are the byproduct. Once I realized that that's the root cause if I start getting out of attachment, Bhayana Krodha will not be there. He said therefore the goal is to get rid of attachment. But I can't get rid of attachment unless I take refuge in something higher. Say Maam Upa Sri Tah One who take refuge in me then me is the me the I I I keep reciting all my life.\n\nIf I take refuge in my I and do not rely on my body, mind and intellect to give me that peace and happiness which I am seeking then I will be liberated. Liberated from attachment. Once I liberate from attachment, I will liberate it from fear and anger.

      "commentary": "What is my purpose and destiny? We had been discussing chapter four, Vinana Karma Sannyasa Yoga, Yoga of Renunciation of accents in Knowledge. This is all about knowledge, all about what the real I is. So far in the chapter two and three saying that what I consider I is not I, but that which is permanent, that which is Ajaha, that which is immortal is me. But then chapter three talked about all the Karma Yoga that how do I act in this world and not get bound by those actions? The continuing that same theme that now how do I act in this world but not get bound by them is the theme of this chapter.\n\nSo the first thing Bhagavan says, Ajaha PI, I am unborn. He clarifies first that let's keep in mind that what's the theme of our discussion? Our theme of our discussion is from chapter two onward is I am unborn. Avya Yatma Immutable. There is no change ever takes place in the self. The supreme self which is all pervading.\n\nSwamiji gives a commentary here that in the early part of Vedic literature there was a great emphasis on immortality. No death, deathlessness. He said that in the later part of this Vedic literature they switched on to Aja. Unbornness, birthlessness. So all of our stories about the Devas are looking for nectar Amrit. There is always a fear of death.\n\nOver a period of time they realized it's not the death you should be worried about, it is the birth you should be worried about. As long as there is birth, there will be death. Only way you can overcome death is by not having birth. That's where it all started, because of my birth that I am now afraid of death. If I achieve the birthlessness, deathlessness I already achieved. So therefore Bhagavan clarifies very first declaration in this chapter is Ajaha Apisan, I am unborn.\n\nNo mutation ever takes place in myself. Now obviously Bhagavan is speaking from the highest perspective of the all pervading self. But we have also seen that our own self is no different than his self. This room space is no different than the space outside. Before this building was built, this space was nothing but the continuation of the space outside. I created this conditioning called walls, floor and ceiling.\n\nNow the same space which is part of the universal space. And I consider it to be a room space. So all the qualities of the space outside still remains intact in the room space. Except in my perception, they're conditioned by this conditioning called walls, floor and ceiling. In my own existence, it is something similar. The self which is all pervading in my own self are exactly same.\n\nThe qualities attributed to the Supreme Self are also valid for my own self. So the first thing is Ajahapi son. I am unborn as the Supreme Self. Therefore my own self is also unborn. No mutation ever took place. Space never get contaminated by or affected by bad designs.\n\nWe design buildings, not all of them are good. So we jokingly say the doctors bury their mistakes. What do we architects do? We put it out there for the world to see every time we pass it. Who the heck designed this thing? But the space in a good building or a bad building are not affected by an architect's design.\n\nIt remains immutable, imperishable. This place was not brought from Hanover County. It will never be transported back to Hanover County. So he said, I am unborn. Therefore you are unborn. No mutation ever took place.\n\nBut Bhutanam Isvaropi son. But I am still the Lord of all the beings. Beings are beings because of my presence. And they are created out of my Maya. It is my Maya which created this universe out of my own self. There was no other material available to Bhagavan when he created this universe other than his own self.\n\nBut if you say there are other material existing, he is limited. He is no more unlimited. So if he is unlimited, you have to accept that there was no other material ever available to him to create this universe. And therefore the material he used to create this universe is nothing but his own self. That self, he says, is immutable. No change ever took place in it.\n\nOnly in your perception. Out of your ignorance. Out of my ignorance, I create my world and identify with this body, mind and intellectual. Just as we walk into this room, we identify this space with this room and say, this room is too low, Ceiling is not too good. Neeli should have made some ceiling or higher. Because we are affected by the conditioning, our perception affected by the conditioning.\n\nSame way Bhagavan said that Bhutana mi swopishan. All beings are who they are because of my presence. This room exists because of room space. Just walls, floor and ceiling does not make the room. The heart of this room is the space in the room. Without space, there is no room.\n\nWithout self, there is no being. So Bhagavan said, I am Isvar. I am the Lord of all beings. However, this universe I have put forth according to its own dharma. Maya has its own Dharma. Sattvarajas and Tamas, those gunas and Dharmas are inherent in this universe.\n\nAnd when there is a decay of this Dharma, when those Dharmas decline, I as the Creator, will set it back. I will participate actively in the creation. To set the creation back to as I design, time and again, we renovated my building. I designed something. After a while it gets deteriorated. We just change carpet in my front room.\n\nBecause when I designed in 2004, I had a perception what the room looks like. Over time, the carpet got soiled. I have to the architect again and say, change the carpet. Now it looks the way I have thought in my mind before. So Bhagawan said the same way, I come back again. Yadayadahi Dharma seglanir Bhavati.\n\nWhen the essential Dharma of this universe gets out of line, then I take active participation. Just as I took active participation in creating this universe. I'll set the universe back to its Dharma. Paritra naya Sadhunam, Vina saya chaduskritam. Whatever went out of Dharma, I will eliminate. And then whatever is in line with Dharma and protect it.\n\nSo the Dharma principle will be restored. And as I said, Dharma is a self regulating principle. As soon as you get out of your Dharma, you lost your existence. As soon as sugar loses its sweetness. If you put sugar on frying pan and it becomes black, and now you put in your mouth, it's not sweet. It lost its existence because it's lost its Dharma.\n\nYou won't call it sugar anymore. So Bhagavan says, as soon as the Dharma gets out of line, the thing or being loses its existence. I destroy them by very fact that the Dharma is lost. So he said, therefore I come back again and again, every time. So I assure you that my creation will always remain as I have designed. The will of Dharma makes it function.\n\nAnd then he said that every being still has to continue working. All beings who are working, they're working in my path alone. No matter what I am doing or you are doing, she is doing, he is doing, everybody is doing is because of that consciousness in them they are functioning because they are living beings, dead. Einstein cannot invent anything as long as they are alive, created, whatever. And whether I am going in the right direction or wrong direction in terms of what my goals are in life as long as I take the support of my consciousness it will allow me to go in the direction which I think is appropriate. That is because of the equipment that I have.\n\nThe equipment which I have will decide what direction I will take. My mind, my intellect, my body will determine what actions I am taking and what direction I will take. Whatever my desires are. Therefore Kanksutta Karmanam Siddhi Ijanti IHA Devataha. Because we want success in this life. We want success which is miserable success.\n\nSomething which I can show people and say this is what I did in last 4 years, 5 years, 10 years. So what we'll do is something. If say this is some pie in the sky type of a goal, I don't really pursue it. I want to pursue something which is I can show the result to the world. In this world getting results of your actions are easy and measurable and showable. Therefore Bhagavan says Kangsadha Karmanam Siddhi Ijanti Ihadvattaha.\n\nTherefore we pursue those senses. Because I think I will get the results which I can enjoy. The whole goal I have is to enjoy the fruits of my actions. I do not want to perform any action which I already know. There is no result for it. If I know that I can keep working in this company and they won't ever promote me or will ever recognize my work.\n\nWhat is a normal advice? You better leave this company or find someplace else which is I work and I get result. So my fruits of actions are driving me and by one side. Therefore people are pursuing different paths what they think will give them those results. My field is different than yours and your field is different than hers and hers is different than him. Next verse says Chaturvarnam Mayasrishtam guna Karma ha Vibhagashah Kartaram Aphima Vidhi kartaram Avyam.\n\nThis is not a social commentary on Indian caste system. This book was not written to have a commentary on whether a caste system is right or wrong. This book is a commentary about yourself. It's a self development book. Gita was not written for you to learn and then teach other people. Gita was designed for you to learn yourself and make progress.\n\nNow I don't know why I am putting these efforts in this field and not Going in. Why did I go to architecture school? I should have been smart enough to figure out that time that I should be there. Medical or maybe some business or Wall street type of commerce. Nobody wanted to go in commerce. In my days, MBA wasn't even invented.\n\nI think it was there but nobody knew. Nobody ever told me, Neil, you can be mba. So only three options. I had you become a doctor. That's your first choice. Second was a chemical engineer, the second choice.\n\nAnd third, either electrical or civil engine. After that, no choice really. After that, Ba ba bcom no value. Nobody told me that if you go to Commerce, Neil, and become Wall street banker, you'll be much better off than becoming an architect. Why did you follow what you followed? Chaturvananyamaya Sristam Guna Karma Vibhaga Saha Looking at the mental moods of people, you can say that entire human race can be divided into four classifications.\n\nAnd Bhagwan says I created them. I'm taking full responsibility. Don't think that it was by accident that people are different from each other. Guna Karma Vibhaga Sah. They need to be complementary. This society cannot function.\n\nIf all want to be architects, there won't be any clients. So if I want to play a cop and robber game, somebody has to be cop and somebody is a robber, right? To play the game, I have to have both characters. To make this universe function, I need to have all the ingredients needed for this universe. For make the human race function, I need to have all types of people will make the human society possible.",
      "reflection": "Today, look for 'action in inaction'—moments when apparent stillness conceals profound inner activity. And look for 'inaction in action'—moments when busy-ness masks inner stagnation.\n\nWhere in your life is genuine transformation happening? Where are you just going through the motions? The wise person sees beyond the surface appearance of action and inaction to the truth beneath.\n\nReflect on the teaching that God Himself works ceaselessly for the welfare of the world, though He has nothing to gain. What would it mean for you to work with that same spirit—fully engaged, yet free from personal agenda?"

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter four, Vinana Karma Sannyasa Yoga Yunga of Renouncing Excellence and Knowledge. It's all about knowledge. It's all about Karma. It's all about knowledge. So the first thing we have seen in this where Bhagavan gave his identity, my nature is identical, that I'm unborn. And because his nature is Ajaha, the nature of myself is also Ajaha is unborn.\n\nBut as long as I am in this life, that will continue performing actions. So also I need to understand actions. Bhagavan said that this world is created by me and it is regulated by Dharma. It is regulated by the laws of nature that we know. The laws of nature have no exceptions and therefore they're self regulated. Nobody has to vouch over law of gravitation.\n\nNobody vouch over the laws of thermodynamics. And you can rely on them. Only time the people deviate from the Dharma is when they have free will. The human beings are the only one who have free will. So when they deviate from that Dharma, Bhagavan said, I manifest to make that Dharma aligned again. So we can say at the micro level, when I will deviate from my Dharma, the situation will teach me to come back to my Dharma.\n\nYou learn a lesson by your own actions, by your own situations. And then as long as there are good thoughts, as we have seen, it says Paritranaya Sadhunam Vinasaacha Duskrita. At the macro level, you can say the whole human society in micro level, when there are good thoughts, are overwhelmed by the bad thoughts in my mind. But one thing, as long as you hang on to the good thoughts, I will manifest in your mind and take care of all the bad thoughts so that the good thoughts will thrive and then you will be able to do what is right for you. Well then the question obviously occurred that why everyone cannot understand what is right and wrong. So Bhagavan said, because in this world, it is easier for us to find the results of our actions, so we pursue our senses and pursue deities of our senses.\n\nIn other words, we try to get success out of our actions. And that's miserable and enjoyable. I can see that I have done something and I got these results. So then we get more and more attached to those actions. That's where the problem starts. So the whole chapter is all about how to detach yourself from your own actions.\n\nTherefore he said that this yoga I have taught to Vivaswan. And then he taught to Manu and the Manu taught to Eswaku. And thus all those Rajasis knew what is right, how to act in this world. So you are liberated. So you're not bound by your actions. But over a period of time that is lost.\n\nSo people are all got then attached to the actions. Everybody is trying to put more importance in what I have accomplished and achieved. And that's how you are judged by the society, by yourself. And they say that's what the problem is. So I'm teaching you this yoga which will liberate you from that. And then he said, obviously all people are not made equal.\n\nChatharuvanyam Maya Guna Karma, vi Pagisah that in any given society the people are four types. And as we discussed last time, no matter how hard you try, you will not be able to justify that. Bhagavan meant the four caste system universified. There are not four types of colors, Chatruvand. Four types of people of different colors I have created. So these were about the skin colors.\n\nObviously there are no four types of skin colors in our society. Or you can look at it this way. The colors are associated with Satvaraja and Tamas as white, red and black. And then they have added the yellow as the Vaishya. Then it's one of the commentary I have read says, okay, if that's the case, if it was a skin color, all whites are Brahmins, all red Indians are Kshatriyas, all Mongolis. People who are yellowish are Vaishyas and all dark people are Shudras.\n\nThat's not true either. So these are the colors of your mind. These are the colors of one's mental textures. See, the people in this world come with four different mental textures. And depending on the Guna and karma, they are divided into the four classification. Any given society at any given time that I am the author of them.\n\nIn other words, they exist because of me. But I'm not involved in. I didn't create them. They are by themselves have their own gunas and karmas. So even though I Act, I do not participate in that. As this self, as the supreme Self, there is no creation.\n\nAll exists is himself as one single entity. And therefore what is created is in perception only. So he said, even though I am the author of Jatir Vraniam, I am not the responsible party. And then we have seen that he said the Namaam Karmani limpanti Namay karmafulasproha. Why I am not attached to that? Because I am not Karma Falas proha.\n\nYou only get attached when you have Karma falasproha. From the self's perspective, he does not have anything to gain. So at macro level, the Bhagavan has nothing to achieve and therefore he has no desire. As long as you have no desire, you cannot be bound by it. At a micro level, all the desires are at my intellectual and mental level only myself is not participating in it. As the self, I'm completely detached from my actions.\n\nSo the actions are performed at the body level, are taught as the mind level desired at the intellectual and mental level. So these sufferers are also mind, body and intellect only. My actions are not right physical level, I suffer through physical level. At a mental level, I suffer through mind and suffer through intellect when they are wrong. But the self is not attached. Therefore the Namam Karmani Limpanti self is not affected by any actions, good, bad or ugly.\n\nJust as our analogy of space, the quality of the space inside the room is exactly the same as outside the room. This space, no matter how I try to contaminate it, will not be affected and will not change its characteristics. Because it remains exactly same as the universal space outside. So myself in me is also in the same manner is not getting affected by my actions. Ithima yo Vijayanarti Karma Vihen NASA badhya. The one who knows this then my accents are only binding my body, mind and intellect.\n\nTherefore the enjoyers and sufferers are nothing but the body, mind and intellect. At the ego level only, the self is not participating and not suffering. One who knows that Karma bhi NASA Badhyate actions do not bind them. Many people in the past, your ancestors knew this. And they continue to perform actions as required by their duties and the roles they've taken. But knowing that core of their being is not affected by these actions.\n\nThey lived very successful life and liberated themselves. And therefore I'm now advising you that you should also do this. Because one thing is clear. You cannot live without actions. Action is a signature of life. As long as you're alive, you have to perform actions.\n\nWhen actions stop that's your death. Only in death you will be actionless. Action you must perform. But you need to change the attitude towards action. So you become actionless. You as the core of your being is not participating in these actions.\n\nSo you align yourself with the one which is not participating. Not align one which is fighting this battle. That's how you will become actionless. Goal is to become liberated from actions. One way to liberate from action is to become actionless. If I don't drive, Meena and I always argue you have a lot of traffic tickets.\n\nLook at me, I've only got one or two. Compare the amount of miles I drive and compare the mile you drive. Then put a probability on every hundred thousand miles you drive or 10,000 how many tickets you got and how many tickets I got. So one way to not get a ticket is what? But you can avoid that. Because you can't come from your home to the class without driving.\n\nSo driving is unavoidable. So somehow you have to avoid getting tickets of other means. So action is unavoidable in life. So getting bound by the action is also unavoidable. But there may be other means to not getting attached is not identifying with the one who is acting. Then when you disown your relative who is doing something bad, you are no more attached to the actions.\n\nAs long as you are relating to that. I am part of that organization which is doing something wrong. You are bound by that. You detach yourself from that. You are just a witness now. So there must be another way of detaching ourselves from actions.\n\nOur Sastra says there is a way. The concept Saksi Chaitanya. Just as when I am watching other people witnessing what other people are doing, I am not getting affected. Because I am just witness. You are doing some two people are fighting. I cannot be blamed for that fight the same.\n\nIf I start seeing my actions as a third party then I will not be bound by my actions. It's called Saksichaitanya. So the next verse says Kim Karma Kim Akarma IDHI kavayo ABHI atramo hita ha. And as Swami explains, even in our day to day life we call Kavi a poet as a Kavi in our vernacular languages. But Kavi with the name of a Rishi was a great Rishi who has written so many of these. You know Richas in Vedas.\n\nSo after that even the other Rishi, other people who are wise were also called Kavis so the Kavi became a connotation for a very wise person. So wise person is supposed to know what is right and what is wrong. But he says Karmas are so complex they wise people do not know what is action and what is inaction. They even get confused, deluded by that. See in this world if we can look at this relationship of cause and effect, everything in our universe works on cause and effect. So this universe is a very predictable universe.\n\nThere is nothing in this universe which cannot be predicted as long as you know all the factors which are acting on that action. So when you send the Mars, whatever the Yan as long as you calculate all the forces and act on that correctly and perfectly, it will land exactly as you plan. If you don't know one factor which is affecting it, you will not be able to predict where it is going to land. So if you know everything about how the actions are reacted by this world you will be able to predict what the results would be. Not very very difficult. But it is difficult to know how many things will affect my actions in this world.\n\nI submit a proposal and I think I have done everything I know. So the result should be this. What I don't know is what the other people are doing, what their proposals would be like and therefore I cannot predict. Therefore I shouldn't be worried about what will come out of that. Therefore I said the nature of action in action is so complex because so many factors affect the result. They even get confused when they try to predict what will happen.\n\nTate Karma Pravakshami Therefore I am going to tell you what Karma is not Karma Phala I'm going to tell you.",

      "commentary": "Bakratam dhammah suryakoti sama. What is my purpose and destiny? So we had been discussing chapter four, Gnana Karma Sannyasa Yoga Yoga of renouncing actions in knowledge. Not renouncing actions, renouncing them in knowledge. How to not identify with their actions. So so far we have seen that Bhagavan said that Ajaha, I am a Jaha, I'm unborn.\n\nTherefore he is also Amara. Therefore he is deathless. One who has no birth cannot have any death. So because he is Ajaha, he is also Amara. And not only that, but he says, I am a Karmaha, I am actionless, I am birthless, I am deathless, also actionless. So at the macro level he says, I'm not participating in anything that you consider is happening.\n\nIt is only happening because of my presence. But I am not actively participating in it because I don't have any desire to get anything out of it. There is no desire for Karma Phala of these actions, therefore I am not involved in it. Even the action is taking place because of his presence. But because he is not involved in it, with any desire to gain anything out of it, he is actionless. Same thing applies at a micro level to our self, which we constantly call it I that I am, I am.\n\nBut then everything we say after that I am, that I is not involved in it. I am working, I am speaking. So all the words which we attach to I and am that existence, I is not involved in it. So Bhagwan says, who is involved in that action? Then the one who consider that to be the actor is involved in it. That I, when I say I am eating, that's a physical act, so the body is involved.\n\nThen when I say I like what I eat, my mind is involved. And then my intellect says, this is pretty nutritious, so I'm going to get some benefit out of it. My intellect is involved. Whatever gets involved, that's the one which is bound by its results. So once the I is not involved as the actor and therefore remains Actionless. That which gets involved will be bound by the actions and therefore has to receive the results.\n\nSo my body is involved in my physical act. So more exercise I do or less exercise I do, more I eat or less I eat will show up in my body. When I go to my doctor, he figures out that you may not have been doing this or you may not be watching your diet. Because my lab results tell him exactly. All that tells him what I had been doing. So the body is bound by its own actions.\n\nWhatever the grudges and complexes I carry, they will show up in my mental attitude. So the mind is bound by what mind does. Then what I learn or not learn will show up at my intellectual level. So this body, mind and intellect are bound by these actions. Till I get attached with that body, mind, intellect, I am not involved and action less. But as soon as I identify with this body, mind and intellect, I become the doer.\n\nAnd that doer is, aham, the ego. Once the ego is formed, that ego becomes the enjoyer and sufferer of these actions. So now who are we trying to really liberate right now? Not the body, not the mind, not the intellect. Ego is the sufferer and enjoyer. That ego is trying very hard to redeem itself.\n\nAchieving a state where there is no unhappiness, there is no sorrow and there is no death. So that ego is trying very hard to achieve that by actions. Because it can only attach itself to the body, mind and intellect. And therefore it says, let me achieve this. I can achieve security by accomplishing things and acquiring things. Or I can achieve deathlessness by finding all the latest cures about or anti aging drugs, whatever that is.\n\nAnd it's failing miserably. No matter how hard I try, I think I'm not aging. But other people say, Neil, you look little old now. My nephews and nieces. Kaka, now you look a little tired. And what do you mean?\n\nWe are trying very hard to achieve what we are trying to achieve through the means available to us right now. But we are not getting there. So Bhagavan said, the only one way to achieve is you disassociate yourself from actions. But actions cannot stop. So say that you have to achieve that knowledge where you start seeing inaction in actions. Actions are being performed.\n\nThe only entity which is inactive in this is myself. My self is not taking any part my consciousness. Just because it is there all These three are functioning the body, mind and intellect. Swamiji uses example that supervisor really doesn't do anything. Let's say in a factory floor, supervisor is not operating machines, but his presence make all the work going on. If he's not there, work will be all over the place.\n\nI give my real life example a lot of times. I used to work in India in architects firm and my boss used to come to United States every two years or so to renew his green card. And those about four or six weeks he's here, we'll have a complete vacation. We all go to work every morning just as when he was there. We try very hard to work for about half an hour. And then somebody will say, you know, Neil, did you know this?\n\nAnd he will start a topic and then everybody get involved. We have about six, seven people in the same room. That topic will go on till lunchtime. Then we realize, oh God, we haven't done anything. Well, let's have lunch. And then after that we can work something.\n\nAnd that will go on till about four weeks. And when we realize that one week my boss is going to come back, we start suddenly putting something on a paper which looks like we had done some work. In the end, there was no real work was done when he was not there. And as soon as he comes, everything goes back to normal. We are working just as the supervisor's presence make all the workers work. But the supervisor really doesn't.\n\nHe doesn't sit down and start doing what he was supposed to do. His presence make it work. But he is not participating in your activities the same way the self is not participating, but the very presence of the self, the consciousness make people work. But because right now my identification is with the workers, all the drawbacks and the quality of the workers become my qualities. But if I identify with that self who is actionless, then I'll see also myself as action less. Karmani Akarma Yahya Pashet One who sees inaction.\n\nInaction action only takes place when my ego gets involved. When I was in Zambia, it was so difficult to get a driver's license because the test was about 20 times more difficult than what you go through here. And without driver's license you can't do anything. So you are so keen on getting a driver's license. You work so hard and your mind and intellect both are involved in driving it so hard. Last week I told somebody that, you know, I'm trying very hard to remember everybody's name.\n\nAnd she said, don't try too hard. That was the problem. So when I'm trying too hard to drive the car, it's so difficult now driving car, I don't consider that as an action because mind and intellect are not involved while I'm driving. So Bhagavan said, when you do that, you reach a level where all your actions you see just as what you see, you're driving, you are literally removed. You have your mind and intellect are free to think about other things. Karmaniya, Karmaiya, Pashet, Karmani, Chakarma Yaha.\n\nNot only that, but even though it seems inaction, but action is taking place. By not acting also you are doing something which is affecting you. Sabuddhiman, Manusheshu. Out of all these people who consider themselves intellectuals, such a person is a wise one. Sabuddhima and Manish Yeshu, he is a Buddhiman. He is a true intelligent person who figured out that actions are taking place at the level of body, mind and intelligence, not at my self level.\n\nSahayuktaha, Such a person is Yogi. He is connected Yogi, one who is connected with the self. As we have seen at a macro level, the supreme self, the God is everywhere, is omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent. At micro level, myself is omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent. In my this body, mind and intellect. When I see that is myself, I'm connected with that self.\n\nSo Sai Yuktah, Krishna Karmakrit and such a person knows how to act. In this world we are all acting but at a very lesser capacity. I think they say you are only using the 1/10 of the capacity of your brain. Our brain has so much capacity, but we are only using it at a very micro level. Bhagwan said, if you then think about how capable you are when you connect to your higher self, then when you act, your actions will be perfect. Krishna, Karma, Krita, Such a person know how to perform real actions.\n\nIt actually says how to become efficient in life by connecting with your higher self. And then the next few _Verses_ actually give the prescription how to attach to that higher self. So now we have learned one what the issue is. Issue is that I consider myself to be mortal who has birth, who is acting in this world and suffering. He said, no, no, you're birthless, you're deathless and you have all the capacity to work in this world except you have a wrong identification. So yes, We hear this word Samaram in our vernacular language.\n\nWhen there is some event is taking place. Samaram, event is Event taking place? For whom all events taking place in his life. Kama Sankalpa Varjita There should be Kama Sankalpa Varjita Kama Desire Sankalpa is translated here as planning. I said determination. What are we determining?\n\nI want to do this and I want to get out of this. So first I have a desire. I want to make million dollar, then make a plan. How am I going to make a million dollar? That plan is based on what I'll get a million dollar out of it. So all my actions are first starts with the desire, then I have a plan to achieve that particular results out of that action.\n\nAnd therefore I'm bound to fail. Because first of all I have not figured out whether what I desire is really appropriate for my capability. And secondly, whether the plan I'm putting together action I'm putting together or capable of achieving it. Because only thing available to me as I said in this world is knowledge of my actions. I do not have knowledge about how the world is going to react to these actions but I'm still determining what the results would be. Therefore there are more unknown than known in my actions.\n\nThere are more chances of failure than success in my actions. Do not have any desire and do not have any plan to get something out of it. Kama Sankalpa Varjita Nana Agni Dagda Karmanam I am acting in this world but my all actions are burnt with the fire of knowledge. The knowledge that this body, mind and intellect are limited. They are limited capabilities. But the self which is involved in this actions is only a Saaksi Chaitan is a witness and he is not affected by any of these actions.",
      "reflection": "Today, look for 'action in inaction'—moments when apparent stillness conceals profound inner activity. And look for 'inaction in action'—moments when busy-ness masks inner stagnation.\n\nWhere in your life is genuine transformation happening? Where are you just going through the motions? The wise person sees beyond the surface appearance of action and inaction to the truth beneath.\n\nReflect on the teaching that God Himself works ceaselessly for the welfare of the world, though He has nothing to gain. What would it mean for you to work with that same spirit—fully engaged, yet free from personal agenda?"

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter four, Gnana Karma Sannyasi Yoga. Yoga of Renouncing actions in Knowledge. So far we have seen that actions are necessary, but actions are also binding. My ultimate goal is to get happiness only way I feel happiness. I'm completely liberated from my limitations and here I am acting in this world and actions are binding. So what is the prescription?\n\nWhat is that one yoga which will liberate me from these limitations? So in the beginning Bhagavan said, this is the yoga which I taught from time immemorial to people. And people have been benefited by this by practicing this yoga to release themselves from these bondages. So I'm going to teach you again and see, the technique is very, very simple. You have to end all your actions in knowledge that you are not the actor. It is as simple as that.\n\nRight now we are taking burden upon ourselves of something which does not belong to us, a responsibility which does not belong to me. I'm taking upon myself which is to control the Karmaphala. My constant goal in life is to get the desired results. That's why we plan five year plan, three year plan. People ask me all the time, Neil, what's your plan? I say, what do you mean what's my plan?\n\nI'm talking about retirement. What's your plan for retirement? You have to plan out retirement in a particular manner so that then I can enjoy the retirement. So we plan our actions, keeping the final results in mind, which is Karma Phala. Karma Phala by very nature is not in my hand because I'm not the Karma Falada. The rest of the world is the Karma Falada.\n\nI act and the world react and that burden on me is binding me. Bhagawan said, once you realize that you are not the actor, the one who you think you are. This body, mind and intellect is not the one who you try to satisfy. The one which is seeking happiness is someone other than your body, mind and intellect. One who wants to be liberated is someone other than your body, mind and intellect. So he starts out by giving his identity, say Ajaha, a peace on Abhyatma.\n\nI myself is unborn, deathless, immutable, and also do not take part in any actions. And therefore the karmas don't bind me. The actions which I don't take part in, they cannot bind me. Bhagavan said, at the macrocosm I am the all pervading Brahman who is infinite, unborn, deathless. And at the micro level Atman has the exact same quality. So at the macro level he is Brahmandu, all pervading, Almighty, all potent, omniscient God.\n\nAt a macro level is Myself which I constantly refer. I is nothing but his own Self. We have logically deducted in our discussion that this world cannot be separate from Him. Because when he created this universe, the cosmos, the Brahman, no other material available to him other than his own Self created out of his own Self. And therefore you and I and this world cannot be any separate from Him. But that understanding when it takes place that this room space is no different than the space outside, then all the limitations of the room space will be gone.\n\nSo right now the room space thinks it's limited by its wall, floor and ceiling and it is suffering from its limitation. I want this room to be a higher ceiling. These limitations are also nothing but his own manifestation. If God is omnipresent, where is my body, my intellect, My mind? They are also part of Him. Only there is only one material available to him to create this universe which is his own self.\n\nSo he created out of his own self. And now I'm trying to liberate his self from these limitations which are also part of his self. It is like a cup which is made up of ice is immersed into water. So the water outside the cup is also water. Water inside the cup is also water. And the cup itself is nothing but water.\n\nBut the crystallization creates identification of name and form and shape. The ego is that crystallization of the shape of a cup. When it melts, it will be all water. So Bhagavan said, once you start realizing that the self you are trying to liberate is already liberated, it is not taking part in any of your actions and therefore it is not bound by it. But you are now identifying this self with this limited body, mind and intellect, with his name, forms and colors. And therefore you are reflecting all its limitations.\n\nSo he said, then now you start contemplating on it and then live your life. So we have seen that how to live Life is Vitaraga Bhayakroda. Without any attachment. Without any particular desired fruits of actions. Which I had been trying to achieve. Which is not in my hand.\n\nAccording to your swadharma. We have learned Swadharma. This body has its own Swadharma. Mind has its own swadharma. Intellect own swadharma. Just go with that flow.\n\nIf I try to make this hall into a concert hall, I'll be disappointed. It does not have any of the qualities of a concert hall. I try to have a music party and then I say I don't sound good here. Because the hall does not have the quality to have the acoustics of a concert hall. As long as I live with the limitations of this room, I'll be happy with this room. As soon as I get out of my expectations of what this hall can do.\n\nI'll be disappointed. Bhagavan said, follow your Sudharma and do actions without any attachment. In any particular expectation of the fruits of actions. So the Last verse, the 22nd. This is the state you should be achieving to be happy. To be perfectly happy.\n\nThe stage which you have to achieve is Yadruchanthusthaha. Whatever comes to me without effort. That sounds a little tricky to understand. Does not mean that you didn't put your efforts. But without conniving and manipulating the results. So that everything will fall in place as I want.\n\nIt's not going to happen. It is not in your hand. No matter how smart you are. Therefore, you act according to your dharma. Then whatever comes without any efforts of manipulating you be santoshta. You put your efforts.\n\nYou realize that was according to my efforts. Move on to the next step. Yadruchala va santoshta Dvanda Athitaha. Of course we know that there are times that will be conducive. At time the fruits will be not conducive. I expected something.\n\nI was targeting to achieve this. But I end up getting this. So that's going to happen. That's a given that the law of nature that things will be different every time, same effort. You put two different times, get two different results. Last time I said this and everybody was very excited.\n\nAnd this time I said let's do this. And nobody is excited. So the world will be like that. Therefore, you will be buffeted between hope and dejection. Vimatsaraha without envy. Now this sounds very difficult.\n\nBut it is the only way you can be happy because as you have seen in our analogies, it's always somebody will be little better than me no matter how high I go. So I saw on CNBC someplace, the most difficult group of people to plan for the retirement is the people who are millionaires. It's easier for one who is in a hundred thousand range. They can project what I'm going to rate how many times current income you need for retirement. It's easy for a guy who's making $60,000 a year. Guys making $10 million a year, they're very difficult.\n\nYou see, it's very difficult for as you go higher and higher to achieve that perfection. Bill Gates, if you ask him that you need an income seven times your current income to retire. But he will never be able to retire. So Bhagavan said that vimatsarah, do not judge your situation by comparing with the other person. You do not know his situation. Every time I see Facebook, I get very depressed because everybody else in the world seems so happy.\n\nI'm the only one who has all these responsibilities and problems. Do not compare your situation with us. That's where the envy comes. I stopped reading Fortune and Bloomberg, Newsweek, everything because it depresses me. I feel so depressed that I don't have any idea how to improve this world. Vimatsaraha Bhagwan said, only way to be happy is not to compare your situation with others.\n\nSama Siddhava Siddha, we know success and failure. It's a relative term. But you decided what success is and you did what failure is. You remember that whatever really came is what you really deserved. Swamiji used to say, you don't get what you desire, you get what you deserve. Sama Siddha ashidhav krutvapi nani badhyata.\n\nHe never gets bound by any actions he performs, good, bad or ugly. Because once you perform actions you're done with, there's nothing you can do about it. So whatever comes back, you say, okay, next move, let's go to the next one. So you see, that's the state you need to achieve. And it seems very difficult, but it is truly, I'll tell you, it is the only way you will be happy. When you get closer to that state, it may not be exactly as you imagine in your mind what yogi should be.\n\nBut at some level, you have to achieve this to be happy. So next verse says, gatha sangasya muktasya gnana avasthi da cha yajnaya acharataha Karma Samagram Praviliyate. Our goal right from the beginning was not to be bound by my actions. My actions should be always pristine and come with the results which are complete. So I will never have to be reacting to it. So I don't want to be bound by my actions.\n\nSo the first goal we have said is Gata Sangasya. Attachment to your actions. Whose actions will be as perfect as they need to be to achieve the goal which we established in previous verse. One who is not attached to his actions. Once I'm attached to my actions, I had an interview. I thought I did the best in my interview.\n\nThen this happens all the time. When we go for an interview, we come back and they select us. How can they select him? I think we were the best team. Give us the feedback. All of them are qualified.\n\nBut what did we not do? You did everything right. But we thought the other day I was a little better than you are a little more appropriate for this project. But we are so attached to our actions. We think that our actions are the most appropriate. Should get the result I am looking for.\n\nBut once I perform action, I should not be attached to Gata Sangasya. We are detached to your actions. Once you perform actions and move on, you are liberated from it. You feel free because you are not thinking about it. Gnana Avasthita Cheta Saha. But this thing only came because I'm established in knowledge.\n\nI have learned over and over and over again. The results are not in my hand. Once that knowledge takes place that no matter how better I do, results will never be in my hand. Same presentation you make one time and you are the best. And next time they will say you are the lowest. Gnana Vastyatchiyata Saha.\n\nHis intellect is established in the knowledge that only control I have is on my own actions and not on the results. Yajnaya Acharataha Karma. Therefore he is acting for only one reason.",
      "reflection": "Today, look for 'action in inaction'—moments when apparent stillness conceals profound inner activity. And look for 'inaction in action'—moments when busy-ness masks inner stagnation.\n\nWhere in your life is genuine transformation happening? Where are you just going through the motions? The wise person sees beyond the surface appearance of action and inaction to the truth beneath.\n\nReflect on the teaching that God Himself works ceaselessly for the welfare of the world, though He has nothing to gain. What would it mean for you to work with that same spirit—fully engaged, yet free from personal agenda?"

      "commentary": "What is my purpose and destiny? We had been discussing chapter four, Gnana Karma Sannyasa Yoga, Yoga of Enunciation of action in Knowledge. So far we have seen that chapter two defined what Yoga is and then told Arjuna that Yogastha Guru Karmani, you perform actions rooted in Yoga. And then Bhagavan defined what yoga is. Samatam Yoga Uchate, equanimity is Yoga. That was the simple but very powerful definition Bhagavan gives it.\n\nSamatam Yoga Uchate, equanimity of mind is Yoga if your mind is balanced in all situations, whether conducive or unconducive. Bhagwante Dutch Yoga. But then how do I translate that into my daily life? So Bhagavan said Yoga Karmasu Kavushalam, dexterity in your actions is Yoga. If you are performing action without any anxiety, then obviously there will be effective actions. And if this anxiety about the fruits of actions is not there, then your actions will be effective.\n\nBhagavan says that's the sign of you being establishing Yoga. Bhagawan dedicated chapter three for defining Karma Yoga. So we have seen in chapter three what Karma Yoga is. Karmas are binding because they are bound by the law of causation. It is bound by the law of cause and effect that if I perform an action that will be the cause and there will be effect which is a reaction from the world and I'll be bound by their reaction. How to mitigate that causation is Karma Yoga.\n\nSo chapter three Bhagavan dedicated to define what Karma Yoga is. And in a simple term in verse nine, he said Yajnarthaat Karmano Anyatra Loko Ayam Karma Bandanah. Any action which is not performed for Yajna is binding in this world. So the simple definition of Karma Yoga is when I perform action for Yajna, then it is Karma Yoga. And we have then defined Yajna. Yajna is any action which is performed for the greater good is Yajna, any action which is performed for my selfish gain.\n\nIs binding action, Karma. Any action which is performed for the greater good is Yajna. Yajna, Loko, Ayam, Karma, Bandanah. Any action which is performed for the selfish motives, if I am at the center of the result, it is for me that's a selfish motive. And therefore Bhagavan said, you're bound by that action. Whatever the reaction comes from the world of your action, you're bound by that.\n\nYou have to enjoy it or suffer it. But if it is performed with a greater good, then you are not bound by it. You perform action and your story ends there. Whatever results come out, the world will suffer or enjoy. So we have defined Karma Yoga in chapter three. Chapter four is now centered on the word Yajna.\n\nSo in chapter three, we have learned what Karma Yoga is, is to perform actions in the spirit of Yajna. But what yajna is is now defined in chapter four. And then chapter five will take that a step further. And what sannyasa is, this chapter is labeled Renunciation of Action in Knowledge. So I'm now renouncing my actions and not mine by thorough understanding that I'm not the doer. In other words, I'm not capable of doing anything unless I'm enabled by all others.\n\nAll others in this world have to do so many things for me to do even a smallest act of drinking tea. When I come to understand that I am not the sole in charge of my action, then my ego will diminish. And then I come to understand that ego actually have no real part in the consciousness which is enabling the ego to perform action. So Bhagavan said, that will be I am now renouncing my action in knowledge. But when I renounce my actions completely, I become a sannyasa. When I have no sense of agency, I am a sannyasa.\n\nSo this concept of Karma Yoga is defined in three chapters. First, define Karma Yoga. And then we will learn what is Sannyasa. So far in chapter four, we have learned what is action, what is inaction. One who sees inaction in action and action in inaction. He's the person who sees things as they are.\n\nThere are times when I'm acting, but it's of no consequences. The time I'm not acting with great consequences of me being not acting. And that's a great action. We have seen last time that Mitch McConnell not bringing whatever legislation on the floor is inaction. But it's the greatest action he performs by not doing anything. So similarly, there Are times we don't do anything.\n\nIf we don't perform our duty, it's an inaction. But that's a great action performed by us which will have the consequences. So you'll learn what is inaction? The one who sees through inaction and action. He knows what actions are. And then we have seen the characteristics of a sage.\n\nWe have seen similar Characteristics in Chapter 2 in Sthita Prajna Lakshana. The last section of Chapter 2 define what a man of perfect wisdom is. So the last verse we have seen. Yadruchalabhasantustaha Dhwandvati Taha Matsyara Sama Siddha asiddhavcha Krustva nani badyate. Who does not get bound by the action? A man of perfect wisdom.\n\nWhat is perfect wisdom? What is action and what is inaction? One who has learned this art of action. Such a person is from our perspective. He is acting feverishly. Swami Chinmayananda was the most dynamic person I knew.\n\nHe was acting all the time. But none of his actions ever bound him. Because Sama Siddhi Asiddhavcha same in success and failure. You take a project and you have great goals. Sometimes you succeed and sometimes you don't. But if you don't take the success and failure to your heart then you are a yogi.\n\nBut therefore those actions do not bind you. He is happy with whatever comes naturally. I perform my actions. What comes to me, I accept as Prasad. I do not question why me and why not me. I am not getting result.\n\nOther people are not doing anything but getting all the credits. But once a one who does not think in those terms, he is happy. Yadrucha Lava Santustha. He gets whatever without any anxiety. He is happy with that Dvandvati Tah. He is beyond the pairs of opposites.\n\nIn other words, he is not affected by the pairs of opposites. Pairs of opposites are very much in this world. There are days which are cold and there are days which will be very hot. But if I know how to deal with both of them then I am a happy person. How do I compare myself whether I am successful or not? By comparing myself to others.\n\nIf I see others are not as successful as I am then I consider myself successful. But I think I am not as successful others. Then I consider myself a failure. That's how we judge ourselves. Our gauge is not inside. Our gauge is outside.\n\nI don't judge by my own height, I judge by other side. Other people are taller than me, therefore I'm short. Other people are shorter than me then I'm tall. When we change who I am Bhagawan said V Matsyara There is no envy. Everybody is who that person is. Such a person Sama Siddha, Siddhav, Krustvapin Nani Badyate he does not get bound.\n\nSo we have seen the definition of perfect person in the verse 23 really ties all that together in half a line. What a person of perfect wisdom is Gatha Sanghasya whose attachment is gone devoid of attachment that the first quality of a sage that he has no attachment to anything. He lives in the present environment, in India, in Egypt, in Iran Wherever I find myself, I find myself comfortable. Bhagawan says that's because no attachment. Gatha Sanghas is devoid of attachment in any situation. If I feel comfortable, that means the word of attachment Muktasya this liberation only comes if I have no attachment.\n\nOne with no attachment is always free. We are bound by our own attachments. The bondage which I feel in this world is my own creation. I myself decided that I am a tattoo. My family, my children, my profession, my possessions I'm bound by them. I feel myself incomplete without them.\n\nI have bound myself and only I have the capability to liberate myself. When I liberate myself from these attachments, I avoid these attachments. Muktasya he becomes Mukta liberated. But this is only possible if Gnana Avasthita Cheta Saha whose mind, whose Chetana whose Chitta is established in knowledge Knowledge about who I am and who I am not. If I know my true self that I am not this body, mind and intellect, the limited being, this body and intellect are my equipment. But I am something other than this.\n\nAll the attachments of the body, all the likes and dislikes of the body, of the mind, of the intellect belong to them only and not to me the self. Such a person will be devoid of attachment. Because he is devoid of attachment he will be liberated. So what is important is the knowledge. Knowledge about your own self. So I may get this glimpse of my true self in meditation.\n\nBut it's not going to last forever. I'll come back to my day to day life and have to work in this world. River Bhagawan said Yajna Acharatah Karma Samagram Praviliyate Then I'll still be working in this world. But for Yajna Going back to the verse in chapter three, Yajna tat Karmanu annytra lokoyam Karmabandana. Now that I have no attachment, I will be working, but only for the Yajna for the purpose of helping the community, helping the society, helping everyone around me. All his Karma will be dissolved.\n\nIn other words, there is no after effect, there is no rebound effect, there is no cause and effect relationship to his actions. He is not performing for himself. The next verse defines what Yajna is. Brahmarpanam Brahmahavehi Brahmagna Brahmanahutam Brahma Eva Tena Gantavyam Brahma Karma Samadhinaha we have seen that everything in this world, if it is manifestation of the same entity, the Brahman, then obviously you and I cannot be any different from Brahman himself itself, herself. Brahman is the reality. Everything else is just a projection on the Brahman.\n\nI cannot be different from my own Lord. Because if God created this universe out of his own self, there is nothing in the universe which is other than Bhagavan God Ishwara Brahman. Therefore he says any action that liberated sage of perfect wisdom performed, he sees that it's happening in the Brahman by the Brahman, in the self, by the self. Very famous metaphor of Yajna used here to explain Yajna. In the Vedic time the Yajna was very central ritual. So in that central ritual you, you have fire invoked.\n\nA deity is invoked and something is offered to the deity through that fire in the fire by the devotee. So Brahma Arpanam, Brahman is the instrument of offering the ladle which is used in the Yajna to pour the ghee, the ladle itself in nothing but Brahman alone. It is the manifestation of the same reality. So Brahma Arpanam, the means to act is Brahman. In my case, the means to act is my body, my organs of actions. They are nothing but the manifestation or the representation of Brahman only Brahma Havihi.\n\nWhat I am offering in that fire, what I am offering is my efforts performing actions that's only enabled by Brahman only. So Brahma Havi, the instrument is Brahman. What is offered is also Brahman. Brahma Agna in the fire of Brahman. So in my case the body which enables me to act in this world is expression of Brahman. My efforts to act in this world is also Brahman.\n\nThe field of action in which I am putting my efforts is also Brahman.",

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter four, Gnana Karma Sannyasiyog Yoga of Renunciation of Action in Knowledge. So we had been discussing Karma Yoga in last chapter and in chapter two, Bhagavan says the Karmani Eva Adhi ka Rasthi Mafula that your right is only to act, but you have no right for your fruits of actions. So for us to understand that concept, we have to understand what action is. So we have learnt in this chapter what action is, which then relates to what we learned about Karma Yoga. In the last chapter where we have seen that Bhagavan said Yogastha Kuro Karmani Sangam tyaktvadhananjaya. That's the essence of Karma Yoga.\n\nDo not expect any fruits of your action. Establish yourself in yoga and then without any attachment perform actions in this world is Karma Yoga action I must perform, but I must perform in this manner and for what I should perform action. This chapter in verse nine says Yajnar Tat Karmano anyatra Loko Yam Karma Bandanaha. All actions other than those performed for Yajna are binding Tadartam Karma Kanthya. Therefore, perform actions for Yajna alone, Mukta Sangha Samacharaha without any attachment, with equanimity of mind. So the final advice we have seen is perform actions for Yajna.\n\nWe learnt in verse 24 then that Yajna is to understand that everything that is involved in my action is nothing but Brahman alone. There is no difference between the hunter and hunted. It's all manifestation of Brahman alone. Say Brahmarpanam Brahma have Brahma Agna Brahma hutam. Using this metaphor of Yajna, we have learned that everything involved in this Yajna, the four things involved the instrument, the offerer, the deity and the offering itself. So these four items Bhagavan said, that is nothing but Brahman alone Brahma Eva Samadhi Nah, it's only going to the Brahman alone.\n\nThis is the renunciation of action, in knowledge. Having this knowledge that all actions are performed because in and by Brahman, by the power of Brahman, Bhagawan said that's Yajna. So then next few verses we learn the 12 types of yajnas we have seen so far 10 of them from verse 25 onward. So in verse 25 we say deva Yajna and Brahma Yajna. Deva Yajna is that when I see that all that is happening in my experience all the sense perceptions are only happening. The offerings of the sense object to the senses, the devas.\n\nTherefore I remain detached from those experiences. Every experience I see is only happening between the sense objects and the senses. I am just a witness of what's happening that Deva Yajna. Then we say Brahm Yajna. When I offer my limited self to my higher self. When I realized that my limited self is nothing but the expression of the higher self, it was never separated from its higher self.\n\nAs we have seen, the room space and outer space is always one and the same. Remove the room space remains where it is. My conditioned self remained where it is after my death. It was here before my birth. So that's Brahm Yajna. That understanding firm in your mind, constantly keeping at the back of your mind in all your action.\n\nThen sense control, that's another type of Yajna. Either control your senses so that they don't wander around or mind control. Senses may bring any information but mind does not get attached to it. That's the mind control. Self restraint by controlling all the senses it's self restraint. So that's another Yajna we have seen.\n\nAnd in the last verse which we have discussed there are five Yajnas we have seen. Dravya, Yajna, Tapa Yajna Yoga Yajna, Swadhya Yajna and Jnana Yajna. So the life of charity. Everything that I have is for charity. Dravyajna is not just giving you one check every year during tax time. But it is something which I offer that everything I have is for the greater good.\n\nNothing belongs to me. What I have acquired from this world, this Prakriti, I have to give it back to the Prakriti. What I have borrowed from this Prakriti, this body, mind and intellect, they also don't belong to me. They are just lended to Me for my experiences, that type of attitude, Dravya Yajna then Tapa Yajna austerities for the self control. When I perform certain disciplines, that's tapa Yajna then yoga Yajna, various upasanas and sadhanas. All these Yajnas are for the purification of my mind and intellect for the Antakarana Shuddhi.\n\nAs a seeker of happiness, my job is only to purify my internal instrument. Rest will happen automatically by God's grace. The Bhagavan is partial to his Bhakta. Oh now he's praising me all the time. It is the very nature of yourself. Just like I think that Yogi Berahur said the the more I practice, the luckier I get.\n\nMy preparation made me worthy of getting that opportunity. So here yoga is the upasana I prepare myself. Then the next one is swadhyaya. Reflecting on your own self introspection. Who I am is this body me, this mind me, the intellect me, the accomplishments me. That's basically is the swadhya Yajna.\n\nAnd then we said Gnana Yajna, Yoga of knowledge, offering your ignorance, consciously trying to get out of the veiling of this mind is Gnani Yajna. Our learning Bhagavad Gita falls into the Gnani Yajna. The last two yajnas, the Pranayama and Pratyahara. These come from Patanjali's Yoga sutra, Ashtanga Yoga, eight parts, the Yama Niyama Asana, Pranayama Pratyaha, fourth and fifth steps of Ashtang Yoga, Pranayama Pratyah. So the verse 29 says Apana Jihuati Pranam Pranay apanam Tatha apare prana pan gati ruddhwa Pranayama Pryanaha. Those who are expert, they're engaged in pranayama.\n\nThey perform this pranayam in various ways. There is not one method. There are various ways. It says Apana Jhuvati pranam. So apana is outgoing breath. And even this book says outgoing breath.\n\nI read Bhagavan Sankaracharya's Bhashya and it says apana is incoming breath. So there is a little contradiction there. And I checked some other books and some of them kind of agreed with Sankaracharya's Bhasha. Apana is incoming breath, Ap Anaha is incoming and Pra anaha is outgoing. But whichever way you look at it, the meaning does not change. Of the verse, let's say apane jhuvati pranam, some offer outgoing breath into the incoming breath and prana apanam tadapara and some offering the outgoing breath into incoming breath.\n\nIn other words, two diametrically opposite practices in pranayama. Pranayama, as we have seen, is the control of all the vital energies. But at the core of it is the control of breath, which is actually the word is svasa. And if you read Patanjan Yoga Sutta, he does not use word prana here. He says svasa, incoming svasana, outgoing use the word swaasa. But the overall technique is also called pranaya.\n\nBy controlling your breath, you control your pranas. All the other functions of the pranas which right now I have no control over. So even when I am in a deep sleep, all my organs are functioning properly. My heart, my brain, my liver, my kidneys. Because the conscious mind has no control over this organ. You can imagine if the conscious mind has to control these organs, then we will all be in lots of trouble.\n\nBut conscious mind has no control over these organs or they are free of conscious mind. And therefore it functions all three states of my existence. That waking, dream and deep sleep. But the yogis have found ways to control these functions by the conscious mind. This is called pranayama. Their observation was that as the state of my mind change, my breathing changes.\n\nSo if I can control my breathing, I may be able to control all my pranas and all my mental thoughts. So the techniques devised was to control breath. Panditji used to say that we have finite number of breaths to take in this life. If you take faster breathing, you have a shorter life. If you have slower breathing, then you have a longer life. So people who are calm, normally quiet and have control over their breathing is normal.\n\nThey live longer life. People who are very excitable and constantly get agitated and excited, their breathing goes faster and they live a shorter life. I have no knowledge about that. But this is what the Yoga Sutra basically say, control your breath so that you are regulating your breath. So many, many years ago when we were in Dallas, Texas, we took the course of Raja Yoga in Pranayama and Raj Yoga. One of my friend's father, Mr. Haris Raja, was a disciple of Aswami Muktananda and he gave us a pranayama training.\n\nWe used to have that in early morning at 6:00. And that's a part of Raja Yoga. So the yogas which we have seen, the pranayama, are performed in three different types of tradition. One is the Shiva Yoga. Vignana Bhairav is the book from the Kashmir Saivites. And you see on TV this Shiva yogicant and he said that by controlling the breath, you can control all your systems.\n\nThere is no need for any medication. We can control everything by controlling breathing. Then popularly, what we know about yoga in this country is Hatha Yoga. Hatha Yoga is basically the first three sections of Ashtang yoga, Yama niyama and asana. We focus more on the third step, which is asana. But then the Yoga Sutra says you should not start pranayama until you have mastered asanas.\n\nSo asanas are very important and they're ones who master the asanas. Then you do pranayam. And many, many teachers I have come across say hatha Yoga is very good, but it also can be dangerous if you are not under the guidance of a trained teacher. Be careful, have a good teacher, then you can practice. Raj Yoga, on the other hand, is considered safer and subtler. So what Pandit Ji used to teach is also Raja Yoga.\n\nAnd what we learned many, many years ago, that's also Raja Yoga where basically the breathing is controlled by nine mudras. They call it remote controls. Now obviously there is no scientific study done on why that works or does it work. But all the yogis have said that they do work. So it's a apana jhuvati panam prana apanam tatha apare prana apana gatirandhwa pranayama prayanaha. Those who are expert, they engage in this pranayama.\n\nAnd in Bhagavan Sankarachaya's Basya, I learned that the first technique of apane jovati pranam is called purak. We talked about purak, Rechak and Kumbhak. He said these three are described here. The first one is called purak. When you are offering incoming breath into the outgoing, it's called purak. Then another is called rachak because you are offering incoming breath in outgoing breath.\n\nAnd then pranapati gatim rudwa. This t restricting the flow of air is called kumbhak. This has to be practiced in a serial manner. So Mr. Raja used to write articles in Times of India. Those articles were published into a book. In that he said that the goal of pranayama is our normal breathing is about 16 breaths in a minute.\n\nThe goal is to reduce them to four. So in one minute there are only four Breaths and he recommends in his book and what he taught us back in 80s is 5 seconds for inhalation, then 2 seconds of Kumbhak, inner Kumbhak for 2 seconds, then 7 seconds of exhalation. Because he said the air has now expanded because of the body temperature. It takes longer to exhale than inhale. So it is seven seconds. So that makes 14 seconds.\n\nThey hold the breath of one second outside before taking the next breath and they start the cycle again. That makes 15 seconds. So there are four breaths in a minute.",
      "reflection": "Today, look for 'action in inaction'—moments when apparent stillness conceals profound inner activity. And look for 'inaction in action'—moments when busy-ness masks inner stagnation.\n\nWhere in your life is genuine transformation happening? Where are you just going through the motions? The wise person sees beyond the surface appearance of action and inaction to the truth beneath.\n\nReflect on the teaching that God Himself works ceaselessly for the welfare of the world, though He has nothing to gain. What would it mean for you to work with that same spirit—fully engaged, yet free from personal agenda?"

      "commentary": " Shri Purohit Swami did not comment on this sloka\n\nWe had been discussing chapter four, Gnana Karma Sanyasi Yuga for renouncing actions in none. So far we have seen that Bhagavan said that I am going to tell you a secret in knowledge, having known that you will not have to know anything else. And this is nothing new. I had been teaching this from the beginning of time how to end your actions. That's the goal, to end my actions. But right now I'm not finding any means to end these actions.\n\nNurghan said that one who developed the knowledge that the self is not the doer. He can get out of this cycle of actions and reactions and actions. Again, the cycle continues. I act the world react that becomes actions for the world. When I react to that reaction, it become my actions and the action reaction cycle continues. He said, once you get out of this notion that I am the doer, then you will be out of this cycle of doing and reacting, suffering, enjoying.\n\nSo in verse 14 he says namaam karmani lin panthi Namay karmafulesh prahaha ithimam yo vijayanathi karma bihin NASA badhyadhya. He is not bound by any actions. One who knows me as Namam Karmani limpanti Karmas do not bind me, they do not attach to me. I don't get attached to the karma in Namay Karmafula. I do not have any desire for the Karma Phala that I is the self in me. I think I have all these desires.\n\nWell, that I does not have any desires. My mind has desires, my intellect has desires, and also my body has desires. It feels a little hot. My body tells me, let's make it comfortable. So all these things which I think I have karma falas pruha or the desire to enjoy is at either the body level, at the mind level or the intellect level. At the self level there is no desire.\n\nThe one who knows himself as the one has no attachment to action. Self never gets attached to any action. Neither that self has any karma falas pruha. One who knows this as his own self in this manner he does not get bound by any actions. Another question is how do we get to that point? So in verse 23rd, the technique is Gatha Sangasya.\n\nHe has given up all attachments. He works in this world but does not get attached. He said the attachment to the world is like a post it notes. As long as it is there, it is attached, you remove it. It does not leave any mark on their wall. Gatha Sangha says no attachment.\n\nYou can take it from here and put it here. And take it from here, put it here. It will get attached to whatever but not leave any mark. Gnana Vasthidha Saha. So he's free, he's not attached. And his intellect is organized by the knowledge that the self is not having desire for any fruits of actions, neither it is taking part in any actions.\n\nYajnaya Charathaha Karmaha. And therefore he is constantly acting in the spirit of Yajna for the greater good. All the actions which are taking place are only taking place for the greater good, not just for my selfish desires. Karma sama Grim pravely. That's how all the karmas will get destroyed for that person. He's not having any sense of identity with his actions.\n\nThen we have seen that this Yajna can be performed in various ways. But what should be the Yogi, the one who has mastered this art of performing actions in Yajna, his attitude. There are two ways he said. The first one he says is Devam Evapare, Yajnam Yogi, Nahapariupa Sataya. Some yogis will perform all their actions working in this world, experiencing this world as the world is offering its objects for the perception of his senses. World's offering to the senses.\n\nIt's not him going to the world, world coming to him. That's how he never gets attached to him. Because he is not really going out to the world. World is coming to him for his perception. So all the perception comes and goes, but he never gets attached to any one of them. That's the one way other.\n\nBrahma Agnavare Yagnam Yagne Eva Upa Jihuvati. Others will sacrifice the self by the self. And the next verse is Brahmarpanam Brahmavi. Everything that is happening is happening by the self alone. So now that when I'm working in this world, I'm offering myself which I consider to be myself right now is my sense of perception. Sense organs of actions in the service of the self, the greater self.\n\nSo now everything which I'm doing is offering to the self by myself. The limited self offering its own self for the service of the self. In this attitude, when he works in this world, he's also not getting attached to any actions because he obviously is not really performing any actions for himself. So both are the various ways the Yogi sees this world. Either this way where the world is offering to himself, or he is offering himself to the greater self. Both are the techniques with which he can continue working in this world, but not getting attached to the actions.\n\nAnd then we have seen that the agnas can be performed in 12 different ways. The fire you have to kindle for this yajna is not the physical fire, but the fire of your self restraint. So Samyama Agni, he's going to start with kindling first his fire of restraint. That restraint first can be at this sense level, sensual perceptions he limits to a point where he does not get attached to them. So restraining the senses is the first method we use it. The second method is the mental restraining the perception.\n\nSo whatever the perception comes, he obviously restrain its impression, does not let that perception leave any impression on his mind. So it's a mental level. And the next level of yajnas we have seen is the intellectual level, Swadhyaya Yajna. I constantly reflect on what is the truth about myself. Constantly asking question, who is it that tells me that I am doing this? So that's swadhya yajna at the intellectual level, which is we call gnana yajna.\n\nThen Bhagavan also enumerated that there are other yajnas as well. But all of them we have seen is performing yajnas in the mental level. By kindling the fire of restraint, restraining of the senses, restraining of the mind, or restraining the intellect into the inquiry of what is the self. We have seen there are other methods available. There is not really one method fits all we know because human beings are made in various different permutations and combinations. Sattva, rajas and Tamas, whichever is most conducive for me, I should be practicing.\n\nBut the goal is to perform actions in Yajna spirit. That's basically the goal. Evam, Bahvida, Yajna, Vitatha, Brahmana, umukhe. Thus there are many yajnas are lying at the mouth of Brahman. These are not the only yajnas that we have described. But there's a limitation for the poet to tell us how many he cannot Enumerate a list of thousands of Yajnas.\n\nWe see many methods that are available to you. Vitatha Brahmanamukha. They are scattered in front of the Brahman's mouth at the gate of Brahman, the gate of perception of the Brahman. There are many paths which are leading towards that that will open the door for you. So any of that, whatever path I take, as long as I have taken the correct path towards my goal, that goal will be available to me. Karma Janaan Vidhi Taan, Sarvaan Evam Gnatva Vimoksha Se.\n\nBut know all those paths are born out of actions. In other words you can sit back and relax and say things will be done and then someday I will have a realization. It's your self efforts. No matter which path you take there is no easy shortcut. All of them you have to put your own self efforts to get there. So know that once you know Karma Jan Viddhi there is not a single path which is just stay relax and you will get.\n\nActions are very much essential in each part. Actions are the binding force right now and I'm trying to get out of it. Actions are the only means available to me to get to Brahman. As long as I put my self efforts on a right path. Bhagavan says Vimoksha Se you will achieve the moksha. As long as I take the right route to go to New York.\n\nWhether I take 95 north through New Jersey Turnpike or go towards Real 95 through Philadelphia and all of that. As long as I know that this path is leading towards my goal and I put my efforts sitting down here thinking about it. I will never go to New York but putting my efforts into it. Tan Sarvan Evam Ganatwa Vimoksha Sey they're all going to take you to the same goal as long as you put your self effort in a diligent manner in a very honest manner. So the next verse says Sreyan Dravyam Yagnath Gnana Yajnaha Parantabah Sarva Karma Ahilam Partha Gnane Parisamarpiate which path I should take. He said the Gnani Yajna is clearly better than the Dravya Yajna.\n\nThis is not an indication that this all the various paths which are described as one is better than other. All paths are gonna lead you. As long as you put your self efforts in a clear understanding what my goal is will get you there. However the culture in the environment may mislead Me, me just writing a check to Hindu Center. I think that I have earned some punyas. Bhagavan says that dravya yajna will get you very little because the whole intention behind writing the cheque makes that cheque what is worse to you not to Hindu Center.\n\nHindu center the same value. I write a check for $101. The $101 they can cash it. But that $01, whether it gives me what value is all about my intentions. What efforts did I put with what intentions, what understanding I did that will give me my reward. Therefore he says Sreyan, Dravyam, Yagnath, Gnana, Yajnah, Paramta.\n\nWhatever your perception of that offering, as long as the knowledge does not take place place, that offering does not get you much. Therefore the knowledge is superior than your physical act of performing Yajna. I may be exercising but not with a clear understanding of what I'm trying to get out of. Then obviously it won't have the same result as with the clear goal of what I'm going to get out of it. With that disciplined actions will get me with a clear plan, clear knowledge what this action should bear. The final results will get you much greater results.\n\nAnd you go to American Fitness. Do you have a trainer? I don't have a trainer. Why do I need a trainer? That trainer will give you this gnana. Which exercise will be better for you?\n\nI may be putting lot of efforts but in a wrong direction. Yesterday we were at somebody's house and somebody took out of the list of what food does not goes with what. In the end we said if you follow this, we will not be able to eat anything. He said parotta should not be eaten with dahi yogurt. So Punjabis are all gone. See, even that knowledge, if it is put in the right context may have some value.\n\nObviously whole of our Ayurveda is about parhaj. You have to regulate your diet and that's you don't need other medication. But for hijj which is near the ahar. But just doing upavas without thinking may actually make me sick.",

      "commentary": "What is my purpose and destiny? We have been discussing chapter four, Gnana Karma Sannyasa Yoga Yoga of renouncing action in knowledge. So we have seen in the beginning of chapter three, Bhagavan had said that there are two paths always available for a seeker to seek the ultimate knowledge. The Gnana Yogi in a Sankhyana Karma Yoga yogina. For the yogis, the Karma Yoga and for the Gnani, the Gnana Yoga. So chapter three we discussed Karma Yoga.\n\nThis is where one needs to start. Bhagavan Saha that if you are engaged in this world of activities, in this rajasic world of activities, then it will start with Karma Yoga. And Karma Yoga simply says act with the balanced mind without expecting any particular fruits of your action and act efficiently. That's basically Karma Yoga. Remain balanced in any situation. Do not react overly in any situation.\n\nBhagawan said, you start with that. Purpose of that is to purify your mind and intellectual so that you can function very efficiently in this world. But what type of action I should be performing in that manner was described in chapter four. In the beginning, Bhagawan said, you should know what is karma and what is akarma. You should know what is vikarma, what is akarma. So you should have some basic gauge to decide actions are appropriate or not appropriate there.\n\nBhagavan said that when you reach a point where action seems inaction and inaction seems action, you now come to understand what action is all about. And how do I get to that point? Bhagavan said, Yajnaar Thaat Karmano Anyatra Lokwayam Karma Bandana. You get bondage from your action in this world because you are acting in this world as an individual trying to compete with the rest of the world. It's creating sorrows and unhappiness and fears and greed and jealousy. That's because this concept of duality that I am an island by myself, the world is out there to get me.\n\nBhagwan said that you overcome by performing your Actions in the field of Yajna. Yajna is something you're not doing for yourself. You're sacrificing something for greater good. So if you go to Hindu temple and Panditji is doing Havana, every mantra start with Idhamna Mama, this is not mine. Up till now I thought this is mine. But right now I'm offering it for the greater good in the holy fire.\n\nSomething I always thought is mine. I offer it as does not belong to me anymore, that we call it charity. The money which I thought is mine, I write a check and send it to a non profit organization. I say now it is not mine, it is yours. You do whatever you need to do. So that's the act of Yajna.\n\nYajna is to sacrifice something which you thought is yours. But you came to the conclusion that really does not belong to me. I heard one of the CNN executive retiring and he said learn, earn and then return. Learn the knowledge, how the business works. Then earn, make money and then return. Return back to the community.\n\nAnd that's what most of us one way or other do. Because we have seen that when person dies, he cannot take anything with him, acquire things, think that his own and then eventually gives up, leaves everything here and goes away. So Bhagavan said that that concept you have to understand even while acting in this world. And therefore you have to act in the spirit of Yajna, in the sphere of Yajna so that you come to realize the oneness. So Bhagavanjarya, once you perform this, you will get the Brahmagna. So I have this translation of Ganeshwar Maharaj Gnaneshwari.\n\nThis chapter is actually titled in Gnaneshwari as Brahma Yajna Prasantsa Brahmajna Prasansa Nama Chaturtha Dhyayah. So here we say Gnana Karma Sanyasi Yogana. There are books I have seen which simply says Gnani Yoga. So chapter four is about knowledge. Knowledge about your own self and how to get it. So the two paths which Bhagavan had initially described that is always available right from the beginning of this universe for a seeker to realize the truth is Karma Yoga.\n\nAnd then Gnana Yoga, Karma Yoga. When you are not ready yet, very Rajasic, perform Karma Yoga. But then ultimately you have to have Gnana. The knowledge, what it is all about, why my actions are not my actions. And when I come to realize, it becomes inaction. It's no longer any action which is belonging to me.\n\nSo in verse 33 we say, Sarvam karma akhilam Partha gnane parisamapyate. Bhagavan came to that final statement saying, O Partha. All the actions, good, bad and ugly that you had been performing or you think you had been performing once you know the knowledge, they get all dissolved once you achieve their knowledge. What is their knowledge? He said we would learn that. Brahma arpanam Brahmahavihi Brahma agno Brahmahutam.\n\nEverything that I perceive in this world that I consider to be something other than me is also not different than me. The same entity which makes me who I am, the very same entity makes the world of plurality what it is. Once I come to that conclusion, Bhagavan said, Sarvam karma akhilam grana parishama pyyade. All actions which I am either very proud of or very afraid of that I may have to pay for them. Those actions all will get resolved. So in last verse 34, Bhagavan said, the only way to get it is to someone who has realized this knowledge.\n\nI can only learn something from someone who has experienced it. If I am dreaming and suffering in my dream, only other waker can see that I may be going through a nightmare and awake me. Are you having a nightmare? Another dreamer cannot do that. Another dreamer who is also dreaming his own dream. He cannot wake me up from my dream.\n\nOnly a waker who is not dreaming can see that I am having a nightmare and can wake me up. So Bhagavan said, go to a guru. You may not call him a guru. You may give him another title. But go to someone who has experienced this knowledge, experienced this truth that there is no duality in this world. The world is the manifestation of the same reality.\n\nThat duality is created out of my own ignorance about the nature of this universe. In Prakriti there is multiplicity. Prakriti itself is one entity. But in that there is multiplicity. Just as I as one person. But I have multiple limbs which has different parts and different functions.\n\nBut I know that all these limbs are nothing but me. And therefore there is no conflict ever. My right hand is not fighting with left hand and left hand is not fighting with my right hand. Because there is a unity of thinking. And that knowledge, you can only get it from a great person who has realized this Tadviddhi Prani pati ne pari prasnayana sevaya. You have to put your own efforts.\n\nYou can't really get it just by thinking about it. You have to put your own efforts with that humility that you do not know. Right now what I know is. Is creating more conflict for me, is creating the sorrows, unhappiness, fears, jealousy, greed, all that. Because I think the world is out there to get me and I need to take care of myself. So once you know the Tadviddhi Prani patena pari prashnena by inquiring what is real and what is unreal, what is my true self and what is not my true self.\n\nSevayah by serving the teacher Upadekshyanti tegnanam Gnani nah Tattvadarshi nah. And if you find that person, if you are sincere you will find a person, if you are sincere to know that that teacher will point you in the right direction, will give you the direction how to find your own self. You have to find yourself. But you will find a guide to get to your destination. Is this something Bhagavan? I'll know one time and then I'll forget it.\n\nThere are a lot of things I have learnt before but I now have forgotten is of no great value. Neil, do you know calculus? I've learned in my college days but I know nothing about it anymore. The Bhagawan said no. This knowledge once you know you will never get confused like this. You are right now confused about whether to fight or not to fight this battle.\n\nKnowing that knowledge, you will never get confused again. Bhutani Ashena Drashasi Atmani Athomai. That is because right now my problem is that I see that world is competing with me and therefore I'm getting confused about how to protect myself. And that's what is creating confusion. In Arjuna's case my people are there and I have to kill them. I have no problem killing others, only my people.\n\nI'm worried about killing them. But once in this I and mind, once dissolved, you will not have any problem. Two people facing each other in a dark alley are afraid of each other because one doesn't know who the other one is. So they hide from each other because they think the other person is out there to rob me. But once they realize that other person is my friend then all the fears are gone. So that identification is the unifying factor.\n\nBhagawan said once that identification takes place, that atmani atomai that you will see that all beings are in your Own self. The self which I consider my own self is not limited to this body, mind and intellect. But it is all pervading and encompassing everything. That teacher will make you realize that yourself is that supreme self where everything is contained in it. And you will see that in me. Me, Bhagavan said, krishna himself.\n\nYou will see in the God all the beings. You also said, that's nothing but your own self. When takes place, all the fears will be dissolved, all the negative tendencies of your mind will dissolve and you will be free from all the problems belong to you. So Bhagavan said apiched, So now I come to that point of gauging my own capability. Am I capable of achieving this? And 99 times of 100 we come to the conclusion that's for the sannyasis, that's for somebody, not for me.\n\nIt may be, but I don't know whether I'm going to get it in this lifetime or not. Don't worry about the lifetime. Because you do not know what your lifetime is. This life is not the only existence you have. Bahuni, me, Vyatitani, Janmani, Tawachaljani. You and I have spent many, many lives before we never perished and we will be there forever.\n\nSo therefore time is not of any consequence here. Neither your own qualification. If you consider yourself to the best among sinners, so even the criminals also have categories. The best and the worst. From a stupid criminal to the most intelligent criminal. All the jewel thief movies I used to love in my younger days.\n\nBecause jewel thief is not an ordinary person, he is so intelligent. If you consider that you are the worst of sinners, then also it does not exclude you. Because sin is nothing but the other aspect of karma. If it is utilized in a proper field, it becomes merit. If it is in a wrong field with a wrong attitude, it becomes sin. So all you are doing up till now is what you consider your sins is you're applying your ability to act with a wrong attitude.\n\nThose attitude and the consequences experiences are creating negative impression on your mind. Therefore you consider yourself sinner. You cannot be a sinner because you are part of that pristine reality.",

      "commentary": "What is my purpose and destiny? We have been discussing chapter four, Gnana Karma Sannyasa Yoga Yoga of renouncing action in knowledge. So we have seen in the beginning of chapter three, Bhagavan had said that there are two paths always available for a seeker to seek the ultimate knowledge. The Gnana Yogi in a Sankhyana Karma Yoga yogina. For the yogis, the Karma Yoga and for the Gnani, the Gnana Yoga. So chapter three we discussed Karma Yoga.\n\nThis is where one needs to start. Bhagavan Saha that if you are engaged in this world of activities, in this rajasic world of activities, then it will start with Karma Yoga. And Karma Yoga simply says act with the balanced mind without expecting any particular fruits of your action and act efficiently. That's basically Karma Yoga. Remain balanced in any situation. Do not react overly in any situation.\n\nBhagawan said, you start with that. Purpose of that is to purify your mind and intellectual so that you can function very efficiently in this world. But what type of action I should be performing in that manner was described in chapter four. In the beginning, Bhagawan said, you should know what is karma and what is akarma. You should know what is vikarma, what is akarma. So you should have some basic gauge to decide actions are appropriate or not appropriate there.\n\nBhagavan said that when you reach a point where action seems inaction and inaction seems action, you now come to understand what action is all about. And how do I get to that point? Bhagavan said, Yajnaar Thaat Karmano Anyatra Lokwayam Karma Bandana. You get bondage from your action in this world because you are acting in this world as an individual trying to compete with the rest of the world. It's creating sorrows and unhappiness and fears and greed and jealousy. That's because this concept of duality that I am an island by myself, the world is out there to get me.\n\nBhagwan said that you overcome by performing your Actions in the field of Yajna. Yajna is something you're not doing for yourself. You're sacrificing something for greater good. So if you go to Hindu temple and Panditji is doing Havana, every mantra start with Idhamna Mama, this is not mine. Up till now I thought this is mine. But right now I'm offering it for the greater good in the holy fire.\n\nSomething I always thought is mine. I offer it as does not belong to me anymore, that we call it charity. The money which I thought is mine, I write a check and send it to a non profit organization. I say now it is not mine, it is yours. You do whatever you need to do. So that's the act of Yajna.\n\nYajna is to sacrifice something which you thought is yours. But you came to the conclusion that really does not belong to me. I heard one of the CNN executive retiring and he said learn, earn and then return. Learn the knowledge, how the business works. Then earn, make money and then return. Return back to the community.\n\nAnd that's what most of us one way or other do. Because we have seen that when person dies, he cannot take anything with him, acquire things, think that his own and then eventually gives up, leaves everything here and goes away. So Bhagavan said that that concept you have to understand even while acting in this world. And therefore you have to act in the spirit of Yajna, in the sphere of Yajna so that you come to realize the oneness. So Bhagavanjarya, once you perform this, you will get the Brahmagna. So I have this translation of Ganeshwar Maharaj Gnaneshwari.\n\nThis chapter is actually titled in Gnaneshwari as Brahma Yajna Prasantsa Brahmajna Prasansa Nama Chaturtha Dhyayah. So here we say Gnana Karma Sanyasi Yogana. There are books I have seen which simply says Gnani Yoga. So chapter four is about knowledge. Knowledge about your own self and how to get it. So the two paths which Bhagavan had initially described that is always available right from the beginning of this universe for a seeker to realize the truth is Karma Yoga.\n\nAnd then Gnana Yoga, Karma Yoga. When you are not ready yet, very Rajasic, perform Karma Yoga. But then ultimately you have to have Gnana. The knowledge, what it is all about, why my actions are not my actions. And when I come to realize, it becomes inaction. It's no longer any action which is belonging to me.\n\nSo in verse 33 we say, Sarvam karma akhilam Partha gnane parisamapyate. Bhagavan came to that final statement saying, O Partha. All the actions, good, bad and ugly that you had been performing or you think you had been performing once you know the knowledge, they get all dissolved once you achieve their knowledge. What is their knowledge? He said we would learn that. Brahma arpanam Brahmahavihi Brahma agno Brahmahutam.\n\nEverything that I perceive in this world that I consider to be something other than me is also not different than me. The same entity which makes me who I am, the very same entity makes the world of plurality what it is. Once I come to that conclusion, Bhagavan said, Sarvam karma akhilam grana parishama pyyade. All actions which I am either very proud of or very afraid of that I may have to pay for them. Those actions all will get resolved. So in last verse 34, Bhagavan said, the only way to get it is to someone who has realized this knowledge.\n\nI can only learn something from someone who has experienced it. If I am dreaming and suffering in my dream, only other waker can see that I may be going through a nightmare and awake me. Are you having a nightmare? Another dreamer cannot do that. Another dreamer who is also dreaming his own dream. He cannot wake me up from my dream.\n\nOnly a waker who is not dreaming can see that I am having a nightmare and can wake me up. So Bhagavan said, go to a guru. You may not call him a guru. You may give him another title. But go to someone who has experienced this knowledge, experienced this truth that there is no duality in this world. The world is the manifestation of the same reality.\n\nThat duality is created out of my own ignorance about the nature of this universe. In Prakriti there is multiplicity. Prakriti itself is one entity. But in that there is multiplicity. Just as I as one person. But I have multiple limbs which has different parts and different functions.\n\nBut I know that all these limbs are nothing but me. And therefore there is no conflict ever. My right hand is not fighting with left hand and left hand is not fighting with my right hand. Because there is a unity of thinking. And that knowledge, you can only get it from a great person who has realized this Tadviddhi Prani pati ne pari prasnayana sevaya. You have to put your own efforts.\n\nYou can't really get it just by thinking about it. You have to put your own efforts with that humility that you do not know. Right now what I know is. Is creating more conflict for me, is creating the sorrows, unhappiness, fears, jealousy, greed, all that. Because I think the world is out there to get me and I need to take care of myself. So once you know the Tadviddhi Prani patena pari prashnena by inquiring what is real and what is unreal, what is my true self and what is not my true self.\n\nSevayah by serving the teacher Upadekshyanti tegnanam Gnani nah Tattvadarshi nah. And if you find that person, if you are sincere you will find a person, if you are sincere to know that that teacher will point you in the right direction, will give you the direction how to find your own self. You have to find yourself. But you will find a guide to get to your destination. Is this something Bhagavan? I'll know one time and then I'll forget it.\n\nThere are a lot of things I have learnt before but I now have forgotten is of no great value. Neil, do you know calculus? I've learned in my college days but I know nothing about it anymore. The Bhagawan said no. This knowledge once you know you will never get confused like this. You are right now confused about whether to fight or not to fight this battle.\n\nKnowing that knowledge, you will never get confused again. Bhutani Ashena Drashasi Atmani Athomai. That is because right now my problem is that I see that world is competing with me and therefore I'm getting confused about how to protect myself. And that's what is creating confusion. In Arjuna's case my people are there and I have to kill them. I have no problem killing others, only my people.\n\nI'm worried about killing them. But once in this I and mind, once dissolved, you will not have any problem. Two people facing each other in a dark alley are afraid of each other because one doesn't know who the other one is. So they hide from each other because they think the other person is out there to rob me. But once they realize that other person is my friend then all the fears are gone. So that identification is the unifying factor.\n\nBhagawan said once that identification takes place, that atmani atomai that you will see that all beings are in your Own self. The self which I consider my own self is not limited to this body, mind and intellect. But it is all pervading and encompassing everything. That teacher will make you realize that yourself is that supreme self where everything is contained in it. And you will see that in me. Me, Bhagavan said, krishna himself.\n\nYou will see in the God all the beings. You also said, that's nothing but your own self. When takes place, all the fears will be dissolved, all the negative tendencies of your mind will dissolve and you will be free from all the problems belong to you. So Bhagavan said apiched, So now I come to that point of gauging my own capability. Am I capable of achieving this? And 99 times of 100 we come to the conclusion that's for the sannyasis, that's for somebody, not for me.\n\nIt may be, but I don't know whether I'm going to get it in this lifetime or not. Don't worry about the lifetime. Because you do not know what your lifetime is. This life is not the only existence you have. Bahuni, me, Vyatitani, Janmani, Tawachaljani. You and I have spent many, many lives before we never perished and we will be there forever.\n\nSo therefore time is not of any consequence here. Neither your own qualification. If you consider yourself to the best among sinners, so even the criminals also have categories. The best and the worst. From a stupid criminal to the most intelligent criminal. All the jewel thief movies I used to love in my younger days.\n\nBecause jewel thief is not an ordinary person, he is so intelligent. If you consider that you are the worst of sinners, then also it does not exclude you. Because sin is nothing but the other aspect of karma. If it is utilized in a proper field, it becomes merit. If it is in a wrong field with a wrong attitude, it becomes sin. So all you are doing up till now is what you consider your sins is you're applying your ability to act with a wrong attitude.\n\nThose attitude and the consequences experiences are creating negative impression on your mind. Therefore you consider yourself sinner. You cannot be a sinner because you are part of that pristine reality.",

      "commentary": "So far in Bhagavad Gita and in our discussion about Vedantic philosophy, we have learnt that Brahman is pristine, imperishable, immutable and without any attributes. That Brahman, which is all pervading, nothing exists outside Brahman. So there is no good or evil which is beyond Brahman, outside of Brahman. And if Brahman is all pervading, then obviously the good and evil, as I perceive, must be residing within the realm of Brahman. But these are two contradictory assertions. One, Brahman is all pervading, pristine, and there is no good and evil.\n\nThere is no happiness and sorrows in Brahman. At the same token, if the happiness and sorrows do exist in my life, then this happiness and sorrows must be existing outside of Brahman. When I make that assertion, I make Brahman limited. Because now that realm of happiness and sorrow is outside the realm of Brahman, which makes Brahman limited. Either there is happiness and sorrow in Brahman, or there is no happiness and sorrows. And Brahman remains pristine, unborn, imperishable, untainted.\n\nSo that is the quest of our life. So then we have looked at how I experience my life and what is my relationship to Brahman. So we have seen that Brahman expresses as Purusha and Prakriti, matter and energy, mind and matter, consciousness and matter. When I think about consciousness, I'm conscious of everything, but not about my own self. So this Purusha remains untainted. The Prakriti, it seems, goes through changes.\n\nThis Prakriti, which is the manifest world, has plurality. And that's where we see changes. World, as I knew yesterday, does not exist today. It has already changed. So it seems Prakruti is going through changes. So we have learned that Prakruti has three Gunas, Sattva, Rajas and Tamas.\n\nThese three Gunas, when they are in equilibrium, there is no phenomenal world. When my three Gunas in my self at a micro level, are in equilibrium, there is no experience which I call deep Sleep. In deep sleep there is no Sattva, there is no Rajas, pure Tamas and everything is in equilibrium. And therefore I do not experience anything. So there is no phenomenal world when these three gunas are in equilibrium. It is only the touch of consciousness when I wake up from my deep sleep that the world of phenomena comes in place.\n\nSo I must make a journey from that world of Brahman which is pristine to the world of phenomena which I experience. So the world of my happiness and sorrows are within the phenomenal world. So Bhagavan in Sankhya Yoga told, you will experience this bliss if you lose your identification with this individual being that you consider yourself to be. And for that he said, you have to purify your internal instrument. The instrument which you have to experience the world outside is mind and intellect. I am experiencing the world outside through my mind and intellect supported by my senses.\n\nRiver Bhagavan in chapter three gave us a simple method of Karma Yoga to purify your mind and intellect. Right now has come to the conclusion that my happiness outside in this world and I need to acquire it. That notion is creating this conflict with this world. And therefore I'm working hard in this world. Actions are motivated by my desire to achieve that state of perfect happiness. All my actions right now are either to get happiness or avoid unhappiness.\n\nSo Bhagawan said, you are motivated by your quest for happiness. All now you have to do is find out where your happiness is. And therefore he said that the happiness lies within yourself and you need to find it. The senses are creating sense experience as we have discussed. And my mind gets deluded by Moha attachment. When I see something which I like, I get attached to it, then I want to acquire it.\n\nAnd if I can't acquire it then I get angry. So Bhagavan said, you have to purify your mind and intellect and therefore start with Karma Yoga. Perform your actions because you're motivated to act in this world. But just change your attitude towards your actions. Your actions should expand your identity. Your problem on one side is your identity so limited to yourself, to your body, to your mind, to intellect, you to expand it more, you expand more.\n\nHappiness, evil, gain. If you come to the conclusion that everything that is happening in this world is perfect then you have less complaint about this world. If Brahman is perfect, then Purusha has to be perfect and Purusha is perfect. Prakriti has to be perfect because Purusha and Prakruti are nothing but the expression of the same Brahman. One cannot be imperfect, another remains perfect. If Brahman is perfect, his creation also has to be perfect.\n\nSo Brahman plus Maya, as we have discussed is Ishvara. If Ishvara is perfect, his creation also has to be perfect. If I take that notion that this world is perfect then the imperfections which I see has to be because of my own ignorance. My complaint about this world is about its imperfection. It is not as perfect as I would like it to be to make me perfectly happy. River Bhagavan said, when you change your vision, your drasthi then you will be able to see that this world is perfect.\n\nEverything is in this world is the necessity. Without that the world will not function. The world will function perfectly for you if you start seeing it as perfect. So that journey was Karma Yoga, Yoga of Action. To expand my identity, more I work for the greater good, more I identify with that greater good. Then achieve that sense of belonging to that greater self.\n\nSo Bhagavan said, you perform Karma Yoga. To perform Karma Yoga, Bhagavan has given us Yajna. And Bhagavan says, once you perform this Yajna diligently then you will achieve knowledge. That knowledge is not outside of you but within you. You already know yourself but right now it is veiled by your identification with your limited self and your duality between the world and you. That knowledge will remove that veil.\n\nSo what we have seen in last few verses is it says Yatha e Dhansi, Samidha, Agnihi Basma Sat Gurute. Just as blazing fire burns everything to ashes, now there is no duality left in that fuel. If you put fire in different things, the wood and something else and paper, all that has duality before. Once it becomes ashes, they all become one. Gnana Agnihi, Sarvakarmani, Basma Saat Kurute Datta. The knowledge about yourself will burn all your actions which you consider either good or evil.\n\nAll of that will merge into one. In this world there is nothing but the same entity. And therefore there cannot be too many different things. Everything has to be the expression of the same entity. I don't identify myself as my mind is separate and I am separate. So at my level I say my mind and body are one and the same.\n\nMy present is nothing but an imaginary line between my past and future. Past and future are not two separate entities but continuum of my own self. So Bhagavan said that knowledge will burn all your Actions just as when I wake up from the dream, all the actions in the dream are resolved. No consequences of any bad, good or ugly actions in my dream. So Bhagavan said, in your understanding all accents will burn. Nahi g na ne Sadrusam Pavitram Miha Vidyate There is no greater purifier of your own actions other than that knowledge that you are not the doer.\n\nThis world is functioning as Bhagavan has designed. So once you know that everything in this world is perfect, it is as it is necessitated and I am a part of it, then it will purify all the impurities in your mind which is creating this confusion. So therefore he said, there is no greater purifier. I try my best to purify my experience, make it all good, but it is not really working. Prabhupada Gandhi Once you know this knowledge that your self is nothing but expression of the supreme self, all your actions will be dissolved and you will be purified of all your wailing and sins. Tatsvayam Yogasansiddha Kalena Atmani Vindhati that the person who is established in Yoga and we have seen the definition of Yoga before.\n\nOne whose mind is completely balanced that he does not get affected by any situation because now he has stopped seeing world as good and evil. He has stopped seeing world as I in the world. So his mind is completely balanced. Yoga Sansidhya Tatsvayam he himself will recognize this in his own self in time to come. It will not happen overnight because as Swamiji says, some guru put his hand on me. But it will happen because I made effort to purify my mind and intellect by gaining the knowledge about who I am.\n\nThat journey may take time. Karl, it will happen. Is it a year from now? But once it will happen. Your job is to keep marching on the path of Karma. Use the methods which are available in Sastra.\n\nAll these yagnas which we have seen. Bhavan said, at the mouth of Brahman, there are many such yajnas are available. In other words, there are so many paths. Whichever path is the most conducive for your own situation, you should take that. But your responsibility is to walk that path and not just know about it. So Bhagawan said, Saddhavan Lavateghnana now for that to take that path, first of all you have to have faith that there is something which I can achieve.\n\nThat destination is available. If I want to go to some fictional place, there is no chance that I will ever reach there no matter how hard I try. A fictional city created in some fictional novel. And if I want to see that. I think people have tried to find Sherlock Holmes home. We all know Sherlock Holmes is a fictional character and therefore everything we describe is somewhat fictional.\n\nBut people still go to London to find Sir Cellock Holmes home. That's a fictional destination. If I know Sherlock Holmes did not exist and therefore his home cannot exist and therefore there is no chance for me to find the home where Sherlock Holmes lived. But if I know that destination which I'm looking for exists, there is Hawaii on this planet and I can go to Hawaii if I make efforts and I save enough money and take my journey. If I have that faith that Sraddha Bhagawan Sankaracharya says. Guru Vedanta Vakya Adisu Vishwas If I have trust in what my teachers have told me that H2O makes water then someday I can go into laboratory and make it happen and then experience myself.\n\nBut if I think this formula is wrong, what my teacher is teaching me then I will never get there. That Sadhana is trust in what I have learned from others from their experience. I trust that there is a destination where the pure happiness lies. Tatparaha Sanyat indriyaha lapate gnanam1 who is tatparaha who is anxious, he wants to go there. Not only I know about Hawaii but I had intense desire to go there. We heard that in Wimbledon both players are equally prepared and equally capable.\n\nOne who wins is one who has the fire in his belly that I need to win this match. That anxiousness, that burning desire to achieve it. Tatparaha Sainyat Indriyaha I may have both have faith there is a destination. I also have this great desire but not disciplined. I want to a great athlete but I have no discipline. So these three if I cultivate, I have faith that there is a state where I can be perfectly happy and I want to get it.",

Now chapter five is called Karma Sannyasa Yoga, Yoga of Renunciation of accents. Some of the books only titled it Sannyasa Yoga. So basically Yoga for renunciation or true renunciation. And the word true is very meaningful here because renunciation can be of many types.\n\nAnd we have been discussing what is true renunciation. Chapter one and two give us the background and gave us the insight into the nature of the self. 3 and 4 talked about karma Yoga, Yoga of action. So our journey is from inertness, which is the true nature of this body. In Prakriti everything is inert and our body is nothing but part of this Prakriti. So the very nature of our self is inert.\n\nGiven a choice, what we want to do is nothing. So what are you doing this weekend, Neil? And my answer is nothing. I really don't plan anything. The real joy is not doing anything. So that's our basic nature is inertia, inertness.\n\nSo inertia is our nature and therefore the danger is that we may fall into tamas. So first quest is to whip yourself up into rajas to start doing activity. You can't do activity unless there is motivation. What is the motivation? My desires, my goals. To acquire accomplice is the motivation that very very important to have motivation.\n\nSo all my activities are driven by my motivation, which is desires. So from inertia I have to go to desire prompted activities. That's where I do things and accomplish and achieve. But then I have to rise above those because I realize that's not the end, that's the means to go to the end. So the next goal is to have desire less activities which is the yoga. So we have seen the yoga is the activity which keeping the greater good in mind so that the Yajnas used in 12 different types of Yajnas described in last chapters, which is to prompt ourselves into level of activity which will purify your mind and intellect.\n\nAnd why are we purifying our mind and intellect? Get to the next stage where we can realize who we are, the self. So that's meditation, Dhyana, contemplating on your own self what it is. So it's a journey from inertia to realizing yourself. Chapter 3rd and 4th prepared us for desireless activities Yagna. As we said, the definition of yajna is activity, which I do for the greater good.\n\nKeeping the good of the entire society, the community, the cosmos, the universe, the humanity in mind is my Yajna. There are 12 different methods we have learned. Now once I have learned the art of action, then I have to go beyond actions. So the next two chapters, chapter five and six focus on how to transcend actions and transcendence. As we have seen something, when I drop attachment to, I transcend that. In the standard examples we have seen is when I was a child or attached to my toys.\n\nAnd as I grow, the attachment to those toys drop. You can't give a 12 year old on a birthday in a balloon or something which you gave him at the age of three. Even though a little Maida, I can see a difference between what I could give her six months ago and now constantly changing, say oh no, I don't want that. See, because that's a baby's toys. Just six months ago she was playing with it, now that's a baby's toy. So you transcend as you attach to the higher and higher.\n\nSo if you attach to the higher, then the lower drops off. When we attach to the activity, Tamas drops off. When I attach to the desireless activities, the desires drops off. And now I have to go beyond that. So the next two chapters. Chapter five makes a bridge between contemplation, the Dhyana and the yoga which is activity actions.\n\nSo therefore it's called a Sanyasa yoga Karma. Sannyasa renouncing actions in the first few verses starts with Arjuna's question. Now this is not really anything unique. Even the ardent students of Bhagavad Gita constantly get confused about what is the goal of life and whether it is sannyasa is good or yoga is good. In the two terms we have defined before, egoless action giving up the sense of doership is sannyasa. If I give up the agency, the I am the doer, it's sannyas.\n\nBut if I give up the enjoyership that I am the enjoyer of roots of my actions, then I am a yogi. So yoga requires tyaga, giving up the Fruits of actions. Sannyasa requires complete renunciation of myself as this limited being as the doer but not very clear to most of us. So Bhagavan puts this question in Arjuna's mouth which we have universally asked. Sanyasam Karmanam Krishna punar yogam Chasansashi Yat shreya etayoho ekam tanme bruhi sunis chitam. We go and ask this question all over.\n\nTell me one thing that I can practice. Don't confuse me with all this elaborate discussion about what is right and what is wrong. Just tell me should I go and do this or not? Sanyasam Karmanam Krishna punar yogam chasansi. You are praising Sannyasa because we have seen several verses in last four chapters which says offer everything to me, just do actions for me. All of that basically means I have to renounce actions.\n\nSo it says Sanyasam Karmana sansasi. You are praising renunciation of action, giving up actions at the same time. And also you are praising Yoga. You spent the whole chapter describing what Yoga is. So now you tell me what is good for me. Yat sreya ethayaha ekam tanmi bruhisoneshitam.\n\nDon't give me two absence. As I told you before, probably absence really create confusion. When I was in Nairobi to buy a car I had to register your name just like in India used to be. And I think they changed. But I'm talking about 80s in India also to get a car you have to register yourself and after two, three years your number comes. Nairobi was same way.\n\nMy boss told me that Neil go and buy a new car. The company used to give me a car and an old car. I was so excited I went and told my friends. My boss told me buy a new car. They all started laughing. I said why are you guys laughing?\n\nHe said new car means next couple of years then you may get it. I said no, no no, I need it now. He said there is no way you're going to get a new car. You register then a number will come. But I was so determined I need a new car. My boss told me you can get a new car, I'm going to get it.\n\nSo I used all my influences, told all my friends, all networking, all business people I knew they finally found one car from the remote area agency where there's one car available. Because you know they allocate quotas to different agencies and remote area. There was no one to buy cars so it was available so we bought the car from the remote area and drove it back to Nairobi. And I was so proud that I got a car. There is not even a question which car it is. Whatever it is, it was actually called Ford Laser.\n\nNone of you may have ever heard here Ford Laser. It is actually Mazda Trivanti, made in Japan for Ford company. I didn't even ask them what does that mean. They actually told me it's actually Mazda but it's Ford. New car, that's all I need. And I was so proud and happy.\n\nAnd after about eight months we decided to come to United States. I had to sell the car. So my boss said, you go and sell the car. I said, are you sure? Yeah, you sell it to whoever there. I realized why he wanted me to have a new car.\n\nThey're selling a car fetches more money than what I paid for because cars are scarce. So somebody has a new car, people going to pay premium. So I sold that car for probably one and a half times what I bought it for. So the company made a profit on me in eight months. I used the car and give a profit to it. Then I come here very first week I realized I can't survive in this country without a car.\n\nSo I told my brother in law, we need to go and buy a car, let's go and register it. You don't need to register. I said when can we go and buy a car? He said, over the weekend we will go. I said are you sure that we're going to wait till the weekend? He said, yeah, yeah, that's right, over the weekend.\n\nHe weekend he tells me that let's go. So we first go to one dealership, four dealership and there are cars till my eyes can see. And he said, you can take any car from here. I said, are you serious? Tell me which one I should take. He said, this is just one dealer we're going to then go to Chrysler, then we will go to GM and then we will go to all the Japanese cars.\n\nYou tell me which car to buy and I'll buy it. But I'm not used to this. If you don't have a choice, that's the best situation you are in. When I started my firm, I did not have too many choices. That was the best situation I was when I had choices, I could never do it for all these years. So Arjuna is in the same situation.\n\nHe said, these choices I can you tell me what is good for me? So at least now we know that Arjuna has come from not doing anything. He wanted to run away from his actions. He is now ready to do actions. He realized that doing right action is what is necessary here. But I do not know what the right action is.\n\nThat's where we are all. We all want to do right things in life. It's just that we sometimes don't know what the right thing is. Therefore now Bhagavan says Sanyasaha, Karma Yogastha, Nistreyaha Sakarao Ubhav Both Sannyasa and Karma Yoga are good. Both lead to Sreyas bliss which I'm seeking. The peace which I'm seeking in life constantly.\n\nIf I do this then all my life will be peaceful. If I do, all my life will be peaceful and I continue to work towards my life. In the process I actually create more agitations. As I told you before, probably in this class that when I started going to Chinmay mission many many years ago, since I was a teenager we took Bhajugava in them and there is one verse comes. Baalahatavat Krida Sakthah Taruna Hatawat Taruni Sakthaha Bruddha Tawat Chinta Saktha. I never understood Bala Tawat Krida Saktha Easy.\n\nWhen I was a little child I was engaged in toys, you know and plays. No problem understanding. I understood it clearly. Mine is a love marriage so I understood what that means. I said why I should be completely relieved by that time, right? I figured out I'm now 20 something.\n\nThe time was three or four. By the time I'm 50, he will be 25 and I have only one son. I'll be completely at peace after that. So why this Vriddha Tava Chinta Saktha? I now understand at my age my Sansar has grown so large since I was in my 20s that I have too many sources of doing Chinta either.",
      "reflection": "Practice what the Gita calls 'renunciation in action.' Choose one activity today and do it without any sense of 'I am doing this' or 'this will benefit me.' Just let the action happen through you.\n\nNotice the quality of mind that emerges when personal stake is released. This is true sannyasa—not running away from the world, but engaging fully while remaining free.\n\nThe person established in this wisdom sees the same Self in all beings. Today, practice looking at others—friends, strangers, even those who irritate you—and remembering that the same consciousness that looks out through your eyes looks out through theirs."

      "commentary": "We completed chapter four and we started discussing chapter five. Chapter four was Gnana Karma Sannyasa Yoga, Yoga of Liberation of actions in Knowledge. Now chapter five is called Karma Sannyasa Yoga, Yoga of Renunciation of accents. Some of the books only titled it Sannyasa Yoga. So basically Yoga for renunciation or true renunciation. And the word true is very meaningful here because renunciation can be of many types.\n\nAnd we have been discussing what is true renunciation. Chapter one and two give us the background and gave us the insight into the nature of the self. 3 and 4 talked about karma Yoga, Yoga of action. So our journey is from inertness, which is the true nature of this body. In Prakriti everything is inert and our body is nothing but part of this Prakriti. So the very nature of our self is inert.\n\nGiven a choice, what we want to do is nothing. So what are you doing this weekend, Neil? And my answer is nothing. I really don't plan anything. The real joy is not doing anything. So that's our basic nature is inertia, inertness.\n\nSo inertia is our nature and therefore the danger is that we may fall into tamas. So first quest is to whip yourself up into rajas to start doing activity. You can't do activity unless there is motivation. What is the motivation? My desires, my goals. To acquire accomplice is the motivation that very very important to have motivation.\n\nSo all my activities are driven by my motivation, which is desires. So from inertia I have to go to desire prompted activities. That's where I do things and accomplish and achieve. But then I have to rise above those because I realize that's not the end, that's the means to go to the end. So the next goal is to have desire less activities which is the yoga.

All of that basically means I have to renounce actions.\n\nSo it says Sanyasam Karmana sansasi. You are praising renunciation of action, giving up actions at the same time. And also you are praising Yoga. You spent the whole chapter describing what Yoga is. So now you tell me what is good for me. Yat sreya ethayaha ekam tanmi bruhisoneshitam.\n\nDon't give me two absence. As I told you before, probably absence really create confusion. When I was in Nairobi to buy a car I had to register your name just like in India used to be. And I think they changed. But I'm talking about 80s in India also to get a car you have to register yourself and after two, three years your number comes.

So at least now we know that Arjuna has come from not doing anything. He wanted to run away from his actions. He is now ready to do actions. He realized that doing right action is what is necessary here. But I do not know what the right action is.\n\nThat's where we are all. We all want to do right things in life. It's just that we sometimes don't know what the right thing is. Therefore now Bhagavan says Sanyasaha, Karma Yogastha, Nistreyaha Sakarao Ubhav Both Sannyasa and Karma Yoga are good. Both lead to Sreyas bliss which I'm seeking. The peace which I'm seeking in life constantly.\n\nIf I do this then all my life will be peaceful. If I do, all my life will be peaceful and I continue to work towards my life. In the process I actually create more agitations. As I told you before, probably in this class that when I started going to Chinmay mission many many years ago, since I was a teenager we took Bhajugava in them and there is one verse comes.

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter five, Karma Sannyasa Yoga, Yoga of True Renunciation. So the chapter opens with Arjuna's question, which one is better? You had been praising Sannyasa. At the same time you are asking me to engage in action. Both are reaching the same goal. Whether you start with Karma Yoga or a Sannyasa, it will take you to the goal which you are striving all your life, that is finding a permanent bliss.\n\nRight now, it seems my life is filled with agitations and unhappiness. No matter how hard I try, I can't get out of agitations. Even when I think I'm doing something with good intentions, it creates agitations. As the Rolling Stones say, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. We do think we are doing it with good intentions. We end up in a very uneasy situation.\n\nSo how do I get out of it? One side, I think if I continue working harder and harder, I'll get to the point where there will be bliss. That's our retirement plan, isn't it? I want to work hard and work hard so I can get to a blissful retirement. Or say, I'm so tired of this agitations and unhappiness, I should give up everything and not get involved in anything. That's typically what we go through in our life at various stages of our life.\n\nAnd that's basically Arjuna's question is, and Bhagavan said no. Intelligently engaging yourself in both, either in Karma or renouncing karma will get you the same goal. However, for you, Karma Yoga is clearly better. You are not at a state to renounce actions. As Swami says, I can only renounce something which I have. I can renounce and say I have given up Hanover County.\n\nI don't own Hanover County. I can't renounce Hanover county. Or I give Hanover county donation to Chinmaya Mission can't happen. I have to have something to renounce. So if I have worked very hard in the field of my actions, then only I can retire from actions. If I never engage myself into actions, there is nothing to retire from.\n\nThe man who never worked in his life, he can retire. If you're not working Monday through Friday, there is no weekend. All seven days are weekend for you. So Bhagavan says first thing is you have to engage yourself in actions. You start with Karma Yoga, apply yourself into actions and you start out your actions in your life with first with desire prompted actions. I want to achieve this, I want to accomplish this, I want to get this and that will get me to happiness.\n\nThen he realized that that's not getting me anywhere. Then started desire less actions. Bill Gates obviously started out with a lot of desires, built the biggest company, want to put PC on every home and build the largest company. And he did whatever is stuck to make the Microsoft the biggest company. Now what he's doing is desireless actions. He's giving up all the money he has earned.\n\nHe's engaging himself actively into his foundation to better the people's life. So I start out to get that happiness through my desire prompted actions. Then graduate from desire prompted action, desire less actions. From this desireless action only I can graduate to the agency less selfless action. So the selfish action then selfless action is a journey. And for that a Karma Yoga is a means to achieve that.\n\nSo Bhagavan said that only the people who do not understand this journey they will think that Karma Yoga is different than Sannyasa, Sankhya or Gnani Yoga is different than Karma Yoga. But one who establishes one will get the result of both. Once I establish myself in Karma Yoga, my mind and intellect will purify and achieve that bliss. So is when I realize that I'm not this limited being being, I am not the doer, then I'll achieve the same bliss. So Yat Sankhe Praapvyate Sthanam Tad Yogi API gamma te. Whatever is received by the knowledge that I am not this limited being is also be achieved by performing Karma Yuga.\n\nSo the one who sees that this is the same path leading to the same goal, Yapasyati Sapashyati. Such a person realizes what the true destination is. What is the true journey is Sanya Sastamaha Baha Dukham Aptama Yogatah. But if I start renouncing things before achieving things, it's very painful. I haven't even gained anything. How can I renounce anything?\n\nSo first step to make myself worthy of giving up. If I start giving up without achieving anything, I want to make a Donation of a million dollar. But I have only hundred thousand dollars in my bank. It's going to give me more pain. If I achieve the level well, I can start giving up. Bill Gates could not have given up his money before Microsoft was built, right?\n\nSo for one who wants to renounce before achieving anything, it's very painful. Therefore don't start thinking about giving up actions before you accomplish actions. Yoga Yukta, Munihi Brahman Achiranadhi Gacha Diprama. Once you establish yourself in the Yoga, Karma Yoga which is selfless action, Niskama Karma from a desire prompted action. When I establish myself from desireless actions it is very easy to give up after that then Sannyasa comes very naturally to us. See therefore in number four Varanasram, you start with Brahmacharya which is the life of a student.\n\nThen Grhasthasram, you have to engage yourself in the activity, achieve things, produce things, do whatever it is to support the society, your family, community. Then Mana Prastam, gradually retreat from all activity. Not suddenly but gradually start giving up the powers to your juniors, your sons, your underlings, whoever you consider. And then Sannyasa, you already taken yourself out of this action to a point where it's very easy to exit out of these actions. So you see, once you establish yourself in that desireless actions it is very easy to achieve that peace which you are looking for. Yoga Yukto Visuddhatma, Vijitatma Jitendriyaha Sarva Bhuttma Bhutatma Kurvanapi Na Lipyate.\n\nOnce I establish myself in desireless action and I want to take Sannyasa. That Sannyasa does not mean that I will not be acting in this world. Outside I'll be working in the world. But now the actions don't bind me. He said Yoga Yukta once was established himself in the Karma Yoga and the art of action. When I was learning music, obviously it's so painful to do this Saragamma Sargam.\n\nOnce you establish in that, it's very easy. So once you master anything, it's very easy to perform that action. So to perform these actions in a right way, Bhagavan said is without desire. You perform the same action without desires. Right now it is very difficult for me. Because everything is prompted by my desire.\n\nI want to achieve this. So all this is creating agitations. Once I'm out of agitations then it is very easy for me to give up. So these are the qualifications Yoga Yuktah Once we established in how to perform actions. Visuddhaatma Vasudhatma. Your internal instrument is purified.\n\nMind and intellect is now purified. So it sees things as they are. And we are not polluted by my desires. Right now the reality is colored by my desire. If the market is going up, we are all very happy. And the interest rates are at zero level.\n\nGreat for a businessman. But as the guy who is retired and he is relying on that investment income, he is suffering with a 0% interest rate for so long. So person who is surviving on the investment income for him 0% interest is a disaster. For a person who is borrowing money to leverage his business, that's great. There's never a better time in this country than last few years. So it's all colored by my desire.\n\nBut the one who is not involved in both, he sees that as a normal occurring. This is how the world works and there's nothing to rejoice or regret about it. Vijay Tatma who has a control over his self in this case is ego. Who has a control over his ego. He knows that these things are happening. I'm just doing my part.\n\nJit Indriyaha One who has control over the senses. Indriyas are there for purpose and they have their own reasons to be there. And I have control over what I see, what I hear, what I touch, what I taste. I have control over it, not my senses. Sarva Bhuttma Bhuttatma now this is the real test of a Sannyasi. Once he starts seeing that the self in me is the self in all beings.\n\nMyself and yourself and his self or herself are not various selves. One self manifesting as me, you, he, she, it. When that reason comes, Bhagavan says Kurvan API na lipya dhai. He can do whatever he wants in this world but not affected by it. We are affected by our actions because we think I've done good, that means I'm going to get something out of it. I've done bad, I'm going to get punished by it.\n\nAll these things because my desires. But once I have transcended the desires. See, when two children are playing and both are your children, who wins and who loses is not a problem. Serena Williams and Venus Williams. At one time they were both in a final Wimbledon or one of them to their father. What does it matter which one will his daughter is going to win.\n\nGuaranteed he is that as otherwise he is jumping up and down in his chair. Whether his daughter is going to win or not, if I start seeing the myself in everything, then whoever is winning or losing is all me winning and me losing. Therefore, Bhagawan always says, you are not suffering, I'm suffering with you. When I suffer, he suffers at the same time. You know, different Puranas, they say that somebody did this or Bhagwan had the pain. It's kind of symbolic.\n\nBut if I pervade everywhere in my dream, even the one who is suffering and one who is enjoying, both are me. So Bhagavan said, when I start seeing that Kurvanna pina Lipyade, then whatever I do is not affecting me. So the following three verses say the attitude of a person who has achieved that level of accomplishment and seeing things as one. How that Sanyasi so is now a realized person. He has seen that the one self pervades everywhere and I am no different than it. His attitude will be Naiva kinship, Karomi Ithi, Yuktah, manyya tattvavit.\n\nHere is the qualification or the description of a self realized master Tattavit who knows in essence what the reality is all about. There is no plurality as we see. The perception of plurality is because I have confined myself to this limited identification. I am a one person when it comes to when I identify this as me. But I am just when representing a family, a company. When I say I'm from Google, so I represent Google.\n\nThe entire Google pervades in me. The whole power of that company I exude when I say I am from Google. I remember I used to work for large companies. So when I go to Austria or someplace, I'm not Neil Bart. I'm representing wzmh, one of the largest companies. When I take out my card and say I'm Neil Bart, wzmh.\n\nI'm not presenting my qualifications. I'm presenting qualifications of my company. Then I left company, started NBJ architecture with four people. Now I have to say I am who I am. It changes your perception when you expand your identification. So one who has expanded his identification to the entire universe, for him Naiva kinship.",
      "reflection": "Practice what the Gita calls 'renunciation in action.' Choose one activity today and do it without any sense of 'I am doing this' or 'this will benefit me.' Just let the action happen through you.\n\nNotice the quality of mind that emerges when personal stake is released. This is true sannyasa—not running away from the world, but engaging fully while remaining free.\n\nThe person established in this wisdom sees the same Self in all beings. Today, practice looking at others—friends, strangers, even those who irritate you—and remembering that the same consciousness that looks out through your eyes looks out through theirs."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter five, Karma Sannyasa Yoga, Yoga of Renunciation of Actions. So far we have learnt in Bhagavad Gita that the self which I consider myself is not the real self. We learnt in chapter two, Sankhya Yoga. So the entire quest in our life is to reconcile this paradox we have. We consider ourselves to be a limited being. But Bhagavad Gita says, you are not the limited being.\n\nSo how do I remove this paradox? How do I change this paradigm with which I'm functioning right now as an individual limited being and identify with that unlimited supreme being? That's basically the goal of rest of the teachings of Bhagavad Gita. So in chapter three, Bhagavan said, you can start with Karma Yoga, Yoga of Action. Act you must but act in a way that it does not bind you so that you can free yourself from this conditioning that you have considered to be. You act in this world without an expectation for the fruits because you are not in control of the fruits.\n\nRight now I consider myself to be completely separate from this world and I'm competing with this world. Bhagavan said, unless you give up this identity of your own, you will not be able to realize your true identity. So Upanishads tell us that the world which I see is finite, that supreme is unlimited, infinite, Almighty, all knowing. But for me to perceive that is very, very difficult. So therefore we stand this Om Purnamadhah Purnamidam Purnath Purnamuddhachate Purnasya Purnamadaya Purnamavashate. It says that from that infinite came this infinite which I see as infinite.\n\nJagat, this Prakriti which I say is also complete and infinite, that from which it came, this supreme Brahman is also infinite, that is infinite. This is also infinite. The world I'm identifying with is also infinite. Even though it seems finite. Even though I see myself as a finite being in the world of the being which I see is finite, it's not Finite, it's infinite. And if you take this infinite out of that infinite, what remains is still infinite.\n\nIn other words, there is no separation between the world which I perceive and the real self. There is no separation between my limited self and that supreme self. But the ignorance is creating this dual vision and I need to remove that. So the first step is when you act in this world, see this unity and don't expect any results from your actions which will relieve you from anxiety of the fruits of actions. And then chapter four said, there is not really two separate entities. Both came from the same singular entity and therefore act for the betterment of the entire Jagat.\n\nThe Jagat that you consider your own world, your own world, maybe your own family, maybe your own community, maybe your own nation. Work for that without expectations that your actions will bear particular results that will free you from this anxiety. And now in this chapter we are learning how to renounce this sense of agency that I am the doer. So Bhagavan started this chapter saying, you can reach that same goal by renouncing actions and also by performing actions. By renouncing actions in the knowledge that I am not the doer will take you to that place where you can identify with your supreme self. But performing actions in this world without any expectations will also lead you to that state by purifying your internal instrument which is right now is conditioned by this limitedness that you have taken upon yourself as your own.\n\nBhagavan said, both are one and the same. Yatsangkhi prapyate sthanam tadyogi apigema. That place which is reached by contemplation on that very fact that we learnt in chapter two that I am not this mortal being, I am that immortal being. If I contemplate on that statement and come to the conclusion that that's the truth where I change my identification from this limited self to the higher self. See, that's the path of Sankhya contemplating on that great statement that Tattvamasi, you are that. But if that's not in my capability right now, Bhagavan said, tat yoge API gammade.\n\nBy performing this Karma Yoga, you can also achieve that same state, the same result. And therefore you should start with Karma Yoga. Because contemplation without preparing your mind for the contemplation is pretty painful. In other words, it will not bear any good result. And then you will be frustrated. And then you will say, I don't think this has any value.\n\nSo rather than engaging yourself in Something you're not capable of, engage yourself in purifying your mind and intellect. The yogi who has achieved the state of purification, he knows that naiva kinchit karomi ITI yuktaham manyate tattvavit. One who knows the essence of the self, that that which feels like my limited self is nothing but the supreme self. It is my own ignorance that I'm identifying with the limitations and therefore I feel limited. One who has recognized that truth by establishing himself in yoga or by contemplation, he knows that naivakinchitkarami I am not doing anything. Everything is performed by indriyani indriyarthesu vartanta ITI dharayan.\n\nHe clearly sees that activity which I perceive sometimes it is performed by me is nothing. But senses are reacting or associating with sense objects. And we can clearly see through our normal observations that my sense of taste will indulge me into eating more sweets that will show up on my body. So this sense object and senses reacting with each other. Or I may consider myself to be a very wise person and have control over my intellect and control over my mind, but just the substance from this world called alcohol. If I indulge in it, all my wisdom and my sanity will go away and I will act like an average idiot.\n\nSo we know that these sense objects have clear effect on my behavior, a clear effect on how I think. And therefore I have to come to the conclusion that indriyaani indriya teshu vartnantah, the senses are indulging in activity with the sense objects. So all the activities, all that which is good and how that is bad is nothing but purely the interaction between the senses and sense objects. And we have seen sabdas parsa rupa rasa gandha, the five sense objects, and kshutra thvaka chakshuhu rasana grana, the five senses we have, you remove one, then the world of that sense will go away. If you remove all five, the world of objects which I perceive will go away. So therefore Bhagavan says, brahmani adhaya karmani sangam tukta karauthiyah.\n\nSo now that I am not at that level of that yogi who clearly sees the naiva kinsit karomi, I am not doing anything. He does not have this confusion that I have. That means I think I am doing this. I have done this and not done this yet he does not have that confusion. He is like that ocean which sees its own waves and sees I as the ocean is not involved in all the activities of the waves. Waves are the water reacting with the wind is creating these waves on my surface.\n\nBut at the bottom of the ocean I am standstill. They say Brahmani Adhaya Karmani Sangam Tyaktva Karutiyah. The Sangam tiktva comes as Sid pointed out last time, in next this verse in next and then Karma Falam tektvakaramde third verse. This tactva word is constantly coming in our discussion. So anytime we see the word tyaktva it clearly means we are already attached. It's a give up, abandon.\n\nI can only do that if I have something which I have to give up. So this clearly says that Sangam Tyaktva I am already attached. It's given that I'm attached to this world. I'm attached to this body, I'm attached to this mind, I'm attached to my intellect. No matter how hard I try, I keep identifying with who I am. As this limited being.\n\nThe idea that I am the doer does not go away very easily. Therefore, Bhagavan said, there is a method to get rid of that. Your mind has a tendency to attach and if you don't give it an alternate, you will never be able to give up your attachment. So the alternate Brahmani Yadhaya Karmani, you offer all your action to that supreme. That supreme which is complete. There is no place for you to be there as an individual.\n\nIf that supreme is all pervading, all complete. If I'm all pervading in my chair, there's no place for somebody else to be here. If that supreme is all pervading, there is no place for me as a little ego to be there. And therefore offer all your action to that supreme. Brahmani Yadhaya Karmani Sangam Tyaktva first you have to detach yourself from this attachment. I'm now in that party.\n\nSo by attaching yourself to Brahman, you offer all actions to him. Right now I'm bound by all my actions. I get success and I get elated. I get failure and I get dejected. When I get dejected and disappointed, it creates negative impression in my mind that the sin I'm incurring. So now the exercise for you, Bhagavan said, is because you are not at that level of a yogi, you offer all your action, continue working, but think that you are not working for yourself, you are working for him.\n\nWhatever the results come, that will be his loss or profit, not yours. This analogy comes in our scriptures all the time. Just as lotus leaf is in the water, but does not get moistened by the water, it comes out of water, goes back into the water, decays in water, but during its lifetime it never gets moistened by the water. The same way you came in this world, you live in this world. You will die in this world. But while living, you don't get attached to the world by attaching yourself to Brahman.\n\nSo here is the technique Bhagavan has given for giving up the sense of agency for those of us who are still at a level of where we think that we are the doers. Kayana, Manasa, Buddhaya, Kaivalay, Indriyahiyapi, Yogi nahakarma, Karvanti, Sangam tyaktva atma sudaye. Again the word sangam tyaktva by giving up attachment, because right now I am attached. That fact has to be acknowledged first. And then we can say what is my next step. It is like that Alcohol Anonymous.\n\nFirst step is to admit that I'm an alcoholic. See, the first step is to admit that I am attached to this world and to my body, my mind and my intellect and my senses. Therefore, now I should say that I am not the one who is instigating all these activities. The activities are done by my body because the very nature of the body to function Manasa by my mind, because the very nature of mind to go out and get attached Buddha, my intellect, the very nature of my intellect to think what is right, what is wrong, what I have experienced, what I have not experienced, and my senses. The very nature of the senses is to go out and get impressions from the world outside. Those impressions now reported to mind creates impressions on mind.\n\nThat impressions on mind creates perceptions in my intellect. And then I become the doer of the activity. But once I detach myself from all of this, Kaya, Mana, Buddhi and Indriya, they are independent of me. They are acting according to their own own nature. But I, the consciousness, the self is not involved in it. Yogi Naha, Karma, Kurvanti, Sangam tyaktwa atma sudaye.\n\nSo here clearly Bhagavan gives us the goal. The goal is the purification of the internal instrument Atma.",

      "commentary": "So now we know that in my life accents are necessary, but they're also my assets. My accents are my assets. Well, Neil, how did you accomplish what you accomplished? All that I have done went to architecture school, then worked for all these years for very little pay. My actions are my assets, but my actions are also liability. So my actions are both the assets and liabilities.\n\nAnd what we try to do is leverage the assets and renounce the liabilities. When you file bankruptcy, what are you trying to do? You're renouncing your liabilities, but at the same token, you have to renounce your assets as well. You know, very good recent example, hdl, very well respected, fastest growing company, thousands of employees and millions of dollars of investment. They filed for bankruptcy. Not only their bad deeds they have renounced and their debt, but the assets also they have to renounce just got sold for like 32 million or $37 million.\n\nThere are probably hundreds of million dollars worth of investment. Bhagawan said that when you file a bankruptcy on your liabilities, you have to also renounce your assets. So if I give up this sense of agency for both my good actions and bad actions, then I'm free. You have no assets, no liability. So Bhagawan said that one who takes the doership has to suffer through merits or the sins of his actions. So the yogi, while working, he realized that he can't give up the agency, but he gives up the fruits of actions.\n\nWhatever will come out, I'll accept. Because I'm not the Ch faladatta, I'm the actor. I have the capacity to act empowered by the Lord as my consciousness. But I have no control over what comes out from the world. The world is the Ch falada. When I practice architecture, all the efforts I put, I can give myself a project.\n\nSomebody else have to give me a project. So Ch Faladatta is somebody other than myself. Now in our Puranic sense, we think that Ch faladatta is Bhagavan Bhagavan is keeping score of what good deeds you have done. What bad deeds you have done. Therefore when we go to the temple, what do we ask for? Bhagavan Maf karna Bhagavan Bhagavan hoge.\n\nWe don't say that you remember what good deeds I have done that I'm in control. Don't Worry about you Mr. Bhagavan. Just Bhagavan maf karna Bhagavan Bhagavan hoge ham saa. So whenever we are in trouble we ask Bhagavan to forgive us for all of our bad actions. When it comes to I'm a self made man. Came to this country with $8 in my pocket.\n\nWhen I left India, the only thing I can take with me was $8. That was the total foreign exchange India government allowed for the people who leave India. So most of us came with $8 in our pocket. Your problems Bhagavan, you take care of it. Bhagavan said, look, neither I can take care of your problem nor can I give you credit for what you have done. Because all these actions which you are performing is in the realm of Prakriti.\n\nNot in the realm of the self. Bhagavan is functioning in the realm of self. So the worst which we will be seeing today says Nakartrutvam nakarmani lo kassya srajati prabhuhu. This is completely in contrast to what we have believed all along. The Bhagavan is the controller of all that I do. See, every time I make mistake, I just tell you what can I do?\n\nBhagavan has made me like that. Bhagavan put me in this situation. And that's a good comforting thought. That look, I'm not doing anything wrong. Bhagawan is putting me in this situation. And also we have this Puranic idea that Chitragupta is writing this book.\n\nWhen you die he will just open up your account and say look, what good deeds you did. What bad deeds you did. Well, looks like your balance is pretty good. Well, it looks like your account on the negative side so it will go to hell. So we thought that somebody is taking care of all these things. So we always have this comfort zone that Bhagavan is actively participating in my life and he is guiding me or he is maneuvering me to what I am doing.\n\nBut now this Verse says Bhagavan says, I'm not doing anything. Nakartrutvam Nakarmani not the doership or the actions are created in this world by Prabhu. One who is a Prabha is a Prabhu. The Lord, one on which my life depends, is my Lord. The Lord is the one who sustains my livelihood. So my Lord is the one on whom my life depends.\n\nSo he's the Lord of my being, my consciousness. As long as I'm alive, I am who I am. As soon as the consciousness leaves me, I'm no longer who I am. That dead body you won't call Neelbhat. You will get rid of him as quickly as you can. Because I am who I am because of the consciousness in me.\n\nSo here Bhagavan says Nakaratrutvam Nakarmani in this world is created by the Lord of your being, my consciousness. The self which I call myself, you call yourself, he call himself, she call herself is not forcing you to do anything. It's not creating any actions for you. It's also not creating any sense of agency for you. It's not taking any part in anything which you're doing. Then where does this idea of me doing things come from?\n\nIt comes from your identification with the conditioning of yourself. Navadvare puree dehi naiva kinship Karomiyeti. It is the embodied one in this nine gated city. He says, I am not doing anything. But the one who identifies with this nine gated city is the doer. And that identifier is my ego that says this is me.\n\nThe ego is the doer because he is the identifier with the conditioning. So Bhagavan said, the self, I, the Lord of your being is not forcing you to do anything nor am I creating any actions for you. He's also not the one who is actively sitting down with his supercomputer and saying Neil did this. He's completely out of this business. He simply says, let the nature takes care of it. Everything that is happening to me is happening because the way I acted according to my nature, nature of my body, nature of my mind, nature of my intellect and then nature of the world on what object I have acted at my level of physical abilities.\n\nIf I punch a guy who is 6ft 5 inches tall and about 300 pound, what do you think the reaction would be according to his Prakriti According to my Prakriti Swabha was too pravarted. So Bhagavan said, in this world actions are also performed by the very nature of the beings. Very nature of my body, mind and intellect. And the Karma Phala coming to me is also dependent on the nature of the world. I always say I may be the best architect on this planet. But if there is no work outside no matter how much efforts I put, will there be any resource?\n\nBecause the world is completely devoid of that need. But if I practice my effort into the field where there is a need which is compatible with my ability then I will get the results out of it. So what is happening? The Karma and Karma Phala are not dependent on. Bhagavan thought I'm a good guy or a bad guy. Well, give Neel some projects.\n\nHe takes Gita class on Sundays. My clients don't care whether I take Gita class or Bible class. They only care whether I can design their buildings effectively. So Kvabhavastha Parvata. Everything in this world is guided by the laws of nature. Bhagwan says I as the Prabhu is not involved at all.\n\nSo please don't count on me. He is a big shocker for all of us. We always thought that no matter what bad I did as long as I go to the temple the coconuts I can offer take care of it. So Bhagwan said, now I do not take part in any of that. Na Adity Kasya Chit Papam. I do not take sins from anybody.\n\nNo matter what bad I do. Bhagavan says it does not affect me at all. Nachayeva Sukritam Vibhuhu. And also I don't accept any good deeds. AAP Khilee Karaha Bhagwansha, you don't do anything for me. I don't accept anything.\n\nI don't accept any of your good deeds or bad deeds. That self which is all pervading is not affected by any good deeds or bad deeds in this universe. Myself, my consciousness which I considered my Prabhu. Because I cannot sustain myself without him. The same self is also Vibhu. So right now I'm burdened by my sins.\n\nIn a sense I'm burdened by what things I have done wrong in my life. I wish I had done this. I wish I had done this. I wish I had not put money in the market before it crashed. I wish I had bought Apple stock when it came out 25 years ago or whatever. But one said, but it's not affecting me.\n\nThe self in me is not tainted by my. My sins, my bad deeds or my good merits. So all the good deeds and bad deeds happening in this world, we constantly ask this question. Why Bhagavan Ko ki Pathani Chaltahe? What is this ISIS doing? And Tsunami and all these terrorists and all the things happening.\n\nIs he sleeping at the wheel? He said, no, I really have nothing to do with it. Everything is happening as per the nature of the Prakriti. Once I have created the Prakriti. Prakriti is governed by its own laws. We know the laws Sattva Rajasantamas.\n\nThese laws and a permutation of combinations create this world of plurality. The world of plurality interact with itself according to their own gunas and creates their own results. But I stay out of it. Once you created laws of the game, referee only judges the player based on the rules of the games. Not what he thinks is a nice guy or a bad person. You have to play by the rules of the games.\n\nOnce I sit in my car and turn my ignition, the car does not know whether a nice person has turned the ignition or bad person. It will go by as the laws of thermodynamics works in the engine. So Bhagawan says, I do not really accept any good deeds or bad deeds. Then why we are not seeing this thing? Why we are not seeing that all these things happening is very natural and it is exactly happening as it should happen. The world is perfect as Dan used to say all the time.\n\nThe world as is is the way it should be. But I constantly think this world is not appropriate. I don't know why everything is so messed up. You know, it's a chaos. But once I know it's not a chaos, it's the cosmos, it's not a chaos. Things are exactly happening in your life as it should happen.\n\nBecause what you did so far, things will exactly happen in your future as you build your future. But then I am completely confused about these laws of the game. I'm actually participating in a game without knowing the rules of the game. Basically that's the problem. If I start playing football without knowing what the rules are, well, I'm going to be crushed. That's exactly what is happening with me right now.\n\nSo Bhagawan says, why that is happening? Agnane Abrutam Gnanam this knowledge about the self is covered by the ignorance.",

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter five, Karma Sannyas Yoga and so far we have seen that Bhagawan said that Karma Yoga is clearly better for you because sannyasa may be more difficult to pursue for one who has not developed a quality that Northwest Tina Kanksha, who does not hate or does not even desire such a person. Sannyasa is not really easy to practice. Therefore, Karma Yoga, the Yoga Yogi Yukta Bhava become Yoga Yukta. Yoga Yukta Bhava is to develop art of performing actions which is for the greater good, not for myself and the technique given to us in this chapter he says while you are performing all your actions, constantly think that you are not doing anything. Pralapan vishrujan, srunan svashan. Even when you are breathing, seeing, hearing, touching, thinks you are not doing that someone other than what you think you are is doing it.\n\nSo that's a technique given to us that constantly while I'm acting in this world, I should see that something else is what is that something else which is doing it? Well, we can clearly identify everything we do is either my body is doing it, my mind is doing it, or my intellect is doing it. The observer who is observing this activity is someone other than body, mind and intellect. So constantly see you as the witness of your own activity. Just as when we witness other people doing and saying I know he's doing well, he's not doing well, I think he's wrong or he's right, but we are not involved in it. So we are constantly judging other people from our vantage point, our perspective.\n\nIf we start developing a practice where we can do the same thing for us, we will clearly be seeing what is right and wrong for us. When we do something wrong. If we step also out of that activity and see it, we'll see whether that was right or wrong and the next time we can correct it. So the technique is given to us. Constantly watch yourself as a third party observer in all the activities you do and then the last few verses which he had been discussing where Bhagavan come out and says that Nakkar truth lokas Prabhu, Prabhu. The Lord is not creating any sense of doership.\n\nThe ego which I have right now saying this is me and I am the doer. I am the enjoyer and I am the sufferer. Bhagawan said, I really have nothing to do with it. So please don't blame me. I did not create this ego for you. It is the very part of the Prakriti that these activities are going on.\n\nYour body, mind and intellect are nothing but part of the Prakriti. You identifying it created this ego. But I am not the creator of your ego. You now have the responsibility to get rid of the ego yourself. Nakartruttam na karmanis Lokas. The Lord who is the Lord of my being is not responsible or not the creator of this ego.\n\nThat which I have, that this is me, that's not me. Nobody else could have done it without me. This cannot function. Bhagawan said, I'm not putting in your head. I'm not creating this sense of agency nor I am creating any actions. In other words, the Lord of my being is beyond the world of activity.\n\nAnd we know this world of activity. At the Prakriti level. Activity is taking place at the level of Prakriti. This world of plurality. The world where I exist and you exist and the world exists. For any activity to take place, you need two things.\n\nWhen I act an object of activity, then only activity takes place. If there is no duality, no activity takes place. That's why when you are alone, you are getting bored. By myself, what can I do? I need somebody to play with. That's why solitude is so difficult for us to practice.\n\nWe want life where everything is going on. The so Bhagawan said, but in reality there is no duality when it comes down to the core of your being. Yourself and myself and his self and herself. So at his level, no activity is ever taking place in his self. Therefore he says that I am beyond this activity. So he said, I am not creating and also I am not creating.\n\nWe constantly blame Bhagavan for the thing which is not going right for us. I know I put all the efforts and got it. When things go right, I don't know. Bhagwan is not looking after me these days. He said I am completely away from your activity. I am not in a business of marrying your actions with the fruits of actions.\n\nI'm not taking stock about what Papa I had done or Punya I had done. It's entirely up to you and the world you're working in to figure out the transactions and what is the results of the transactions. Because I created this Prakriti out of my own self by my Maya. In the chapter before we have seen clearly says that I am working in this world out of my own Maya. Ajahapisan Avya Yatma Bhutana Iswaropisan Prakrutim Swam Adhishthaya Sambhavami Atma Mayaya by my own Maya. By presiding over this Prakriti, I work in this world.\n\nSo once I created the Prakriti out of my own Maya from the Bhagavan's perspective, my work is done. I created the field of activity, the rules of the activity, the laws of nature. And we had been saying many, many times in this discussion that the laws of nature are without any exception. They apply to all of us in the Prakriti equally. It does not see that because I have done this many punyas that my papa gets wiped out. It's not a canceling each other type of activity.\n\nYou do one good, you're forgiven one bad. You pay for your bad and you get reward for your good. That's the rules of the game. So one, I am a part of the Prakriti. I'm going through my life within the laws of the Prakriti. Now as long as I am abiding by the rules of the Prakriti then I'll be evolving in the Prakriti.\n\nThe whole game is the Bhagavant Leela, Krishna Leela as we call it is that it starts out as being the ignorant self of who I am. That's the original sin. When I forgot who I am is the original sin. Avidy from that Avidy through my own efforts, evolutionary effort. So when I was just in one cell amoeba, I evolved at the lap of Mother Nature. Then I became human being.\n\nAnd now I have to evolve with my own efforts. With this evolution, I have to get out of this identification with this body, mind and intellect to identify with the self where the game started when the Avidya started. And I have to get out of the Avidya and become Vidya again. While I'm at the Prakriti level, I still have a responsibility and activity to Perform. So in chapter three, we are given the rules of the game. If you really want to evolve in this Prakriti act for the greater good.\n\nAll your activities must be for the greater good. For the Yajna spirit, not for you as this self, as you consider self, which is this body, mind and intellect, but for the greater good. By acting in this greater good, I will rise above this selfish ego and will purify my mind and intellect. Now we are giving self will. And therefore at times we will be acting part of Dharma. And the part against Dharma in this chapter says, I am not taking any part into your activity.\n\nIt's done as per the rules of the games. When I put the key in the ignition of my car, there is no discrimination for BMW to decide whether I'm a nice guy or a bad guy, whether I'm the owner of the car or the thief who is stealing this BMW. It would work exactly as the laws of thermodynamics and electricity are in this nature. It will start the car as long as I have the right key. So you see, if he's not taking part, then who is maintaining the laws in this nature? If there are laws in this nature, there got to be law giver and law enforcer.\n\nWithout law enforcer, no law is of any value. Because the law enforcing there is a law enforcement, the laws are abided. In this country or anywhere else in this world, we see the laws are very precisely followed in nature. So there got to be law enforcer. And if he says I'm not taking part, who is law enforcing? Bhagawan says, that's also me.\n\nAs part of my lower nature as a Prakriti, I control the laws of Prakriti. And therefore anytime in a society when majority of the people are not following these laws, I have to take charge again and set those rules visible again for everybody, clarify the situation and make those laws again visible to people to follow. So all the bad elements are weeded out. Dharma is re established. His job as a law enforcer is to make sure that in the Prakriti laws are followed. And therefore Prakriti continues to function as it is designed.\n\nPrakriti is a self regulating entity and therefore Prakriti itself will create its own enforcement and clarification. So the verse we have seen in chapter four, which seem like in a direct contradiction to this verse, which was seen. Whenever there is a decay of Dharma. Dharma is not decaying. You are not following Dharma. When the people are not following Dharma then ay abyuthanam Adharma tadatmanam Srijamiham to get rid of the Adharmas, those who are not following Dharma.\n\nSo how does that work? That's not at an individual level. Bhagawan comes down and says, you're a bad guy. I'm going to eliminate you. You're a good guy, I'm going to help you. It's like federal government.\n\nWe have this Federal Reserve Bank. This sets the monetary policy. They don't come and call me and say, neil, so what's happening in your company? You think you need some help? Can we do something with the interest rate so NBG architecture can function better? Or let me call you a next door guy, whether he's doing okay.\n\nWhat they look at is a country. What are we doing as a country, we are doing well. Well, I don't have to do much or raise the interest, whatever is appropriate. We're not doing well. Has to come down and say we're going to lower the interest rates. And at one point it was like minus 25% or something like that.\n\nBut it's not at an individual level. At the national level, Bhagavan said, at the global level, I see yada yada. Hi Dharma Seyaglani R. Bhavati. When I see that overall the Dharma is decaying green building movement, we saw that Dharma is decaying on this planet. We are constantly emitting this carbon dioxide. We are depleting the ozone layer.\n\nSo Bhagavan Hinda Srijami himself has usgbc, United States Green Building Council or something like that. Now there is an awareness that we need to be working towards sustaining energy, sustainable design, preserving this planet. Anytime there's a decay of Dharma in this global society, he needs to create this awareness again about the Dharma and establish Dharma. But at the individual level, my actions and my rewards of my actions are truly at the level of the nature of actions, nature of this world and nature of the field of my actions. At that I have to rely on the laws of the society, the laws of nature, laws of community.",
      "reflection": "Practice what the Gita calls 'renunciation in action.' Choose one activity today and do it without any sense of 'I am doing this' or 'this will benefit me.' Just let the action happen through you.\n\nNotice the quality of mind that emerges when personal stake is released. This is true sannyasa—not running away from the world, but engaging fully while remaining free.\n\nThe person established in this wisdom sees the same Self in all beings. Today, practice looking at others—friends, strangers, even those who irritate you—and remembering that the same consciousness that looks out through your eyes looks out through theirs."

      "commentary": "Discussing chapter 5, Sannyasa Yoga Yoga of Renunciation. Renunciation Always anything that we think we are possessing, so in this case our actions, we think our actions are our own. Therefore renouncing those actions is the renunciation. So so far we have learnt in Bhagavad Gita who we are as the limited beings. As we had discussed many times before, the first six chapters of Bhagavad Gita described tvam in that Mahavakya Tat Tvam asi that thou art, that thou you is what we have learned so far. Then chapter one we have encountered the situation which we encounter in our daily life.\n\nA common man facing day to day situation which never comes clean cut as black and white, good or bad, happy or unhappy. It always have complexity which makes me confused about what is right and wrong, which action to be taken. So we have seen Arjuna's situation. He cannot see whether there is good in fighting the battle or running away from the battle. Fighting the battle is going to create some collateral damage as we have seen recently in Afghanistan. Some people who I really respect and revere may also get hurt or killed.\n\nAnd that happens in our life all the time. So first chapter describe our situation as we face in life today. The second chapter told us that what we think who we are is not who we are. So there is a paradigm shift for us. We consider this self to be this limited me, this body, mind and intellect. And at the end of my journey in this life, this self will be destroyed.\n\nThe self that I consider myself will never be destroyed. The death will be only for the body. So that's a paradigm shift for us. So now understanding that it still does not give me what to do next. So the third chapter gave us the instruction about how to work in this world in an efficient manner. The two things it told us.\n\nOne thing it says Swadharma Nidhanam, Shreya, Paradharma Vayabah. Act according to your own nature, your own Prakrisi, because that's where your welfare is. Your good is in acting according to your nature, Paradharma, Bhayavah, others Dharma may seem very noble, very excellent, but you can follow that because that's not your Dharma. Act according to your Dharma and act for the greater good. Not just in a selfish manner, just for your own good, but act that can help the greater community in that. We called it Karma Yoga.\n\nThe art of acting in this world which will help me purify my mind and intellect, is called Karma Yoga. Then chapter four says, once you learned how to act outside in this world, now you have to renounce these actions which you considered yours. Even while I'm acting in a Karma Yoga, I still think I'm practicing Karma Yoga. So there is still agency involved and say, I am doing it. So the fourth chapter says, you have to now renounce these actions in knowledge. Knowledge which you already learned in chapter two.\n\nThat is self, which I consider self is not the self. That which I consider self is actually the equipment belong to the self, body, mind and intellect. So now in the chapter four it says, learn that this knowledge about the self and renounce these actions, that these actions belong to the Prakriti, this body, mind and intellect, they do not belong to me, the self. That's chapter four, Chapter five. We started seeing Karma Sannyasa. Now how to really gain this sannyas which we talked about in chapter four.\n\nSo we have this detailed instruction about how to think, how to adjust our attitude towards actions. And the first thing it said is, think that you are not doing anything. And then it says, Brahmani Yadhaya, Karmani, Sangam, Tyaktva Karutiyah. The person who devote all his actions to the Brahman, that universal self, not just myself as the limited self, but I am doing it for that greater self. Then he does not incur any sin. He does not incur any negative impression on his mind.\n\nOur problem is we take our actions so personally that somebody says, neel, you are not doing well. We get hurt right away. Right away it tells me that this person is not respecting me and it starts putting the negative impression. So the next time when I have to do that, I'll be thinking twice, should I be doing it? Will people appreciate it or will it not be appreciated? So that negative impression will not be on the mind of a person who is not doing it with this limited ego.\n\nBecause to him, action is an action, the result is a result. So he has no impression on his mind. So such a person will act in this world like a Padmapatra, the lotus leaf which remaining in the water coming out of the mud does not ever get tainted by any of that. Water falls on it, it rolls off. So that's the technique given to us in this chapter. In such a person who is constantly thinking about his self as the greater self will be liberated from these limitations.\n\nAnd then we have seen that is such a yogi. Once he get to that level then how will he be behaving in this world? Bahiasparcesu Asaktatma he is unattached to the context outside. Sabhrahma Yoga Yoga Yuktamatma Sukham Akshayam Asnute we are constantly seeking this happiness which is unlimited. We are not seeking happiness which is limited. We think we are happy if we get some limited happiness.\n\nGreen card, Green card, Green card. Once I have it I won't ask for anything more. But I know the next thing I'll ask is now I got the green card. Maybe I need to find the right person to get married. So take a vacation for three weeks from your job maximum go to India. And I said, Neel, I can't do it in three weeks because my parents aligned up all the girls.\n\nBut I think I still need some more time. Can I get two more weeks of vacation? And then it continues. We are seeking unlimited happiness. And Bhagavan said there's only one formula that works. Sua Saktatma is unattached to the context outside in this world.\n\nSabhrama Yogi Yuktarna Such a person is Yogi. He is one with the Brahman, one who is connected with the Brahman. And all of this seems very difficult to practice. So next verse says, but remember that it may give you happiness. What is there if I am going to avoid all these pleasures in my life? What is the fun of living life?\n\nWhen I was teenager we used to have this joke. He said when you go up to the Chitragupta he will ask Bdpaka PI because we are smoking. So we have to justify if you didn't do that, what did you do? Go back, experience all that and then come back. So we think if I don't experience any pleasure in this world, what is there to to live this life for? They say, well you can experience all these pleasures.\n\nRemember Yehi sans Parsija Bhoga Dukha Yoane this pleasures coming out of context with the objects in the world outside has limited capacity to give you pain. There is a womb of unhappiness. So unless you are careful, you will know that these pleasures are Adi and Antavanta. It starts at one point of time and will end. So you don't get Ramatha Inasa, don't get engaged into it. You experience the pleasure and move on.\n\nIt's not that it's a nice day, I'm saying no, I mean this is not good. I mean how can you have a nice day? How can I enjoy nice day? Gita tells me it's all Adiyanta Vanta. But when there's a nice day, enjoy it. But next day when there's not nice, don't complain.\n\nThat's all it says not Ramadan that you are not going to have riots in the city of Richmond. Because why we don't have nice days. Why is he not controlling their climate? We know this is the reality of life. The next three verses tells us why one should be detached from this context outside and how. Saknutihi yeva yaha sodham prak sareeda vimokshanaat Kama krod udbhavam vegam sa yuktaha sa sukhi nara.\n\nThe happy person definition is here. We are very happy, elated. I read on Facebook somewhere that may your life be as happy as it seems on Facebook. Because we know that that's not the reality, right? We are not putting all the garbage from our life on the Facebook. So Sukhi who is truly sukhi, not who appears to be happy.\n\nWe all appear to be happy. From other point of view. Neel, you're doing very well. Only Neel knows how he is doing, right? Bhagavan said Saknoti, hi Evaha yaha sodum praksharevamuksanath. Before this body disintegrates, who can withhold the vega the power of Tamakru, the udbhavam that force which is generated in in my mind by Kama the desire and Krodha the anger.\n\nIt did not say you will not have Kama or Krodha. Vega is the operative word here. When it is flowing peacefully in a serene manner, it is the most enjoyable thing, right? People enjoy the river. Some of our friends have houses right on the river. And we all go in envy and say James river.\n\nWhen Wakin was predicted, he was preparing for so James river, when it is flowing peacefully there is no problem. It gives peace and happiness to anybody. Our mind is like the river. When it is flowing in a peace and a serene manner, it takes you towards your happiness. When do we think about some inspired projects or inspired actions? When we feel happy, when we are calm and happy then we say let's do this.\n\nWhen I am upset, no matter how good an idea put in front of me, forget about it. So the mind has to be serene and flowing in a in an appropriate manner towards its goal. Then only the peace and happiness can come. But this uninvited guest Vakin comes. The wake will be manifold uncontrollable and then anything comes in its way it will destroy. Bhagwan said that Kama and a Krodha when that desire is so powerful that you are rushing towards that objects of desire and whatever comes in your way you want to destroy.\n\nThat's anger that Vega should be withheld. A person who can withhold the force of Kamayana Krodha in his mind Yukta. He is the one who is connected with his own self. Because he will be then happy in all situation. Because he has control over the flow of his thoughts. Mind as we have learned in Tattva Bodhi is nothing but the flow of thoughts.\n\nOne thought does not make a mind. Second thought creates the genesis of mind. Then more and more thoughts, second thought give rise to the third thought and the fourth thought and fifth thought in the same direction. Now thoughts flowing in one direction create in my mind. As long as the mind is flowing toward the right destination in a disciplined manner, it creates happiness. When my desires are all over the place I want to be a billionaire and then I also want to become a wise person.\n\nAnd then I also want to be a sports personality. And then I'm torn all over and then I'm creating disaster. A person who creates before this capacity, before this body disintegrates. Because after that you don't really have any chance. This is your chance to create discipline in your mind. Such a person is Sukhi Naraha Yo Antaha yo.\n\nYou know all this expression in the slang language Yo yo yo yo.",
      "reflection": "Practice what the Gita calls 'renunciation in action.' Choose one activity today and do it without any sense of 'I am doing this' or 'this will benefit me.' Just let the action happen through you.\n\nNotice the quality of mind that emerges when personal stake is released. This is true sannyasa—not running away from the world, but engaging fully while remaining free.\n\nThe person established in this wisdom sees the same Self in all beings. Today, practice looking at others—friends, strangers, even those who irritate you—and remembering that the same consciousness that looks out through your eyes looks out through theirs."

      "commentary": "Discussing chapter 5, Sannyasa Yoga Yoga of Renunciation. Renunciation Always anything that we think we are possessing, so in this case our actions, we think our actions are our own. Therefore renouncing those actions is the renunciation. So so far we have learnt in Bhagavad Gita who we are as the limited beings. As we had discussed many times before, the first six chapters of Bhagavad Gita described tvam in that Mahavakya Tat Tvam asi that thou art, that thou you is what we have learned so far. Then chapter one we have encountered the situation which we encounter in our daily life.\n\nA common man facing day to day situation which never comes clean cut as black and white, good or bad, happy or unhappy. It always have complexity which makes me confused about what is right and wrong, which action to be taken. So we have seen Arjuna's situation. He cannot see whether there is good in fighting the battle or running away from the battle. Fighting the battle is going to create some collateral damage as we have seen recently in Afghanistan. Some people who I really respect and revere may also get hurt or killed.\n\nAnd that happens in our life all the time. So first chapter describe our situation as we face in life today. The second chapter told us that what we think who we are is not who we are. So there is a paradigm shift for us. We consider this self to be this limited me, this body, mind and intellect. And at the end of my journey in this life, this self will be destroyed.\n\nThe self that I consider myself will never be destroyed. The death will be only for the body. So that's a paradigm shift for us. So now understanding that it still does not give me what to do next. So the third chapter gave us the instruction about how to work in this world in an efficient manner. The two things it told us.\n\nOne thing it says Swadharma Nidhanam, Shreya, Paradharma Vayabah. Act according to your own nature, your own Prakrisi, because that's where your welfare is. Your good is in acting according to your nature, Paradharma, Bhayavah, others Dharma may seem very noble, very excellent, but you can follow that because that's not your Dharma. Act according to your Dharma and act for the greater good. Not just in a selfish manner, just for your own good, but act that can help the greater community in that. We called it Karma Yoga.\n\nThe art of acting in this world which will help me purify my mind and intellect, is called Karma Yoga. Then chapter four says, once you learned how to act outside in this world, now you have to renounce these actions which you considered yours. Even while I'm acting in a Karma Yoga, I still think I'm practicing Karma Yoga. So there is still agency involved and say, I am doing it. So the fourth chapter says, you have to now renounce these actions in knowledge. Knowledge which you already learned in chapter two.\n\nThat is self, which I consider self is not the self. That which I consider self is actually the equipment belong to the self, body, mind and intellect. So now in the chapter four it says, learn that this knowledge about the self and renounce these actions, that these actions belong to the Prakriti, this body, mind and intellect, they do not belong to me, the self. That's chapter four, Chapter five. We started seeing Karma Sannyasa. Now how to really gain this sannyas which we talked about in chapter four.\n\nSo we have this detailed instruction about how to think, how to adjust our attitude towards actions. And the first thing it said is, think that you are not doing anything. And then it says, Brahmani Yadhaya, Karmani, Sangam, Tyaktva Karutiyah. The person who devote all his actions to the Brahman, that universal self, not just myself as the limited self, but I am doing it for that greater self. Then he does not incur any sin. He does not incur any negative impression on his mind.\n\nOur problem is we take our actions so personally that somebody says, neel, you are not doing well. We get hurt right away. Right away it tells me that this person is not respecting me and it starts putting the negative impression. So the next time when I have to do that, I'll be thinking twice, should I be doing it? Will people appreciate it or will it not be appreciated? So that negative impression will not be on the mind of a person who is not doing it with this limited ego.\n\nBecause to him, action is an action, the result is a result. So he has no impression on his mind. So such a person will act in this world like a Padmapatra, the lotus leaf which remaining in the water coming out of the mud does not ever get tainted by any of that. Water falls on it, it rolls off. So that's the technique given to us in this chapter. In such a person who is constantly thinking about his self as the greater self will be liberated from these limitations.\n\nAnd then we have seen that is such a yogi. Once he get to that level then how will he be behaving in this world? Bahiasparcesu Asaktatma he is unattached to the context outside. Sabhrahma Yoga Yoga Yuktamatma Sukham Akshayam Asnute we are constantly seeking this happiness which is unlimited. We are not seeking happiness which is limited. We think we are happy if we get some limited happiness.\n\nGreen card, Green card, Green card. Once I have it I won't ask for anything more. But I know the next thing I'll ask is now I got the green card. Maybe I need to find the right person to get married. So take a vacation for three weeks from your job maximum go to India. And I said, Neel, I can't do it in three weeks because my parents aligned up all the girls.\n\nBut I think I still need some more time. Can I get two more weeks of vacation? And then it continues. We are seeking unlimited happiness. And Bhagavan said there's only one formula that works. Sua Saktatma is unattached to the context outside in this world.\n\nSabhrama Yogi Yuktarna Such a person is Yogi. He is one with the Brahman, one who is connected with the Brahman. And all of this seems very difficult to practice. So next verse says, but remember that it may give you happiness. What is there if I am going to avoid all these pleasures in my life? What is the fun of living life?\n\nWhen I was teenager we used to have this joke. He said when you go up to the Chitragupta he will ask Bdpaka PI because we are smoking. So we have to justify if you didn't do that, what did you do? Go back, experience all that and then come back. So we think if I don't experience any pleasure in this world, what is there to to live this life for? They say, well you can experience all these pleasures.\n\nRemember Yehi sans Parsija Bhoga Dukha Yoane this pleasures coming out of context with the objects in the world outside has limited capacity to give you pain. There is a womb of unhappiness. So unless you are careful, you will know that these pleasures are Adi and Antavanta. It starts at one point of time and will end. So you don't get Ramatha Inasa, don't get engaged into it. You experience the pleasure and move on.\n\nIt's not that it's a nice day, I'm saying no, I mean this is not good. I mean how can you have a nice day? How can I enjoy nice day? Gita tells me it's all Adiyanta Vanta. But when there's a nice day, enjoy it. But next day when there's not nice, don't complain.\n\nThat's all it says not Ramadan that you are not going to have riots in the city of Richmond. Because why we don't have nice days. Why is he not controlling their climate? We know this is the reality of life. The next three verses tells us why one should be detached from this context outside and how. Saknutihi yeva yaha sodham prak sareeda vimokshanaat Kama krod udbhavam vegam sa yuktaha sa sukhi nara.\n\nThe happy person definition is here. We are very happy, elated. I read on Facebook somewhere that may your life be as happy as it seems on Facebook. Because we know that that's not the reality, right? We are not putting all the garbage from our life on the Facebook. So Sukhi who is truly sukhi, not who appears to be happy.\n\nWe all appear to be happy. From other point of view. Neel, you're doing very well. Only Neel knows how he is doing, right? Bhagavan said Saknoti, hi Evaha yaha sodum praksharevamuksanath. Before this body disintegrates, who can withhold the vega the power of Tamakru, the udbhavam that force which is generated in in my mind by Kama the desire and Krodha the anger.\n\nIt did not say you will not have Kama or Krodha. Vega is the operative word here. When it is flowing peacefully in a serene manner, it is the most enjoyable thing, right? People enjoy the river. Some of our friends have houses right on the river. And we all go in envy and say James river.\n\nWhen Wakin was predicted, he was preparing for so James river, when it is flowing peacefully there is no problem.

The wake will be manifold uncontrollable and then anything comes in its way it will destroy.

      ],
      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 5, Gnana Karma Sannyasa Yoga Yoga of True Renunciation of Actions. We are coming to the concluding part of chapter five, the last three verses. And we have seen previously that Bhagawan said that the one who develops qualities which are appropriate to merge with Brahman, he merges with Brahman. Yah Anta Sukhaha Antahramah Tatha Antah Jyotihi Evayaha, Sahayogi Brahmanirvanam, Brahma Bhutodi Gachade. These are the qualifications one must develop. If he wants to attain that eternal liberation, wants to merge with the supreme Self.\n\nIf he wants to achieve the final goal of attaining complete liberation, then he needs to understand this finite being is not capable of attaining that. He has to leave attachment to this finite being, this body, mind and intellect which is running outside and seeking happiness outside. That idea has to be renounced, that happiness lies outside in the world. And he has to develop qualities where he becomes satisfied within his own selves. Yha Antaha Sukhaha who finds his happiness within himself. Ya Antahramaha who revels in his own self, Antha Jyoti.\n\nHe reveals his own existence. I do not need anyone to convince me that I exist. Other verification is required for everything else. I need verification whether I'm smart, whether I'm powerful, whether I achieved anything, am I an architect or not? I need a verification. But whether I exist, I need no verification.\n\nI know that the self emerging knowledge by oneself, one who is relying on that, one who identifies with that Sahayogi Brahmanirvanam, he loses his self. He loses his identity in that greater identity. As we have seen in our analogy, when a small company merges a big company, the small company's name goes away and it becomes one with the larger company. Lavante Brahman Nirvanam, Rusayakshina Kalmashaha. But to achieve that, you have to become Kshina Kalma without any impurities of mind. Bhagwan those disease who have purified themselves of all sins, they achieve this Brahmanirvanam.\n\nThey dissolve themselves into this Brahmana. And we have seen this sin is nothing but the agitations in my mind. As long as I want something out of this world, it's a desire. And as long as I don't have it, I'm incomplete. That creates agitation. If I acquire it, I want to preserve it.\n\nThat creates another agitation. I accomplished all that. I have this bank balance in my 401k. It seems I'm set for my retirement of what happens if the market collapses and I lose everything. So there's always fear of preserving what I have and also an anxiety about what I have not accomplished. One who is without this agitation in his mind, whose mind is purified, he attains that ultimate truth.\n\nHe becomes one with that supreme self. Chinna Dwai dah He does not see the duality. Up till now I have lived my life as an island. The world is outside which is competing with me and I have to get my happiness out of it. So I'm constantly in battle with this world outside as an individual. If that individuality is dissolved and if I expand my identification as we have seen before, right now my ego is concentrated in my limited self which I call myself.\n\nIf I can expand my ego to include others, my identification. So at a small level we all do that. We identify with our family, we identify with our friends. We identify with our community, our nation. Therefore, when Brazil was not doing well in coronavirus, we were not that upset. But now India is not doing well.\n\nWe are all very disturbed. Because identification. I have expanded my identification from not just me but the country where I was born and raised and also the country which I live in, Chennadvaidah. They have expanded their identification to include everything. Yat Atmanah has a control over this limited self. Once I identify with the world, then my recreation becomes to seek the welfare of all beings.\n\nSo these are the qualifications we have seen of the person who wants to achieve the liberation. Mumukshu who is desirous of moksha, the liberation. One who is happy the way he is, he does not need anything to do with this. But one who is not happy with the condition he is in and he wants that liberation for him. These are the qualifications he has to achieve. He has to strive for.\n\nAnd then the next three verses, the last three verses, they're actually introductory verses for the next chapter. Swamiji explains that in Sanskrit Literature it is very common that the author will introduce a subject at the end of a chapter so that you are ready for the next chapter. It's like in Gujarati magazines. The story gets very interesting and then it ends and says more interesting part will be in the next edition. So Bhagawani is also using the similar technique. He's introducing meditation in these last three verses.\n\nAnd these verses are more like sutras in very succinct way. The entire process of meditation and the goal is described. It says Sparsan krutva bahihi bahiyar chakshuhucha evantare bruvoho prana panav samukrutva nasya bhyantara charino. Here is the entire technique of meditation is given. The first is Sparsan krutva bahi bahyan. Keep all the sense objects outside, outside of your perception.\n\nSo don't let the senses bring the information from outside of the sense objects which then creates these impressions on your mind. You shut off that mechanism of bringing all those impressions from the outside. This is something like if you have an old style camera which has a Kodak film in it. If you open the shutter, whatever is inside the image will come inside to the lens. And then the film is like your mind. So the film will capture the impression on it.\n\nSo there are two ways you can avoid taking any picture. One is you don't open the lens at all. I have done it before. Forgot to remove the cap. I kept clicking but nothing on the film because the lens was covered. Kathopani said you should fold your senses into the mind.\n\nThe senses are not turned inward, they are not looking outwards. Then there is no experience from outside. Or keep the experience outside, outside only. Not let it influence your mind. And focus your gaze at the juncture of your eyebrows. It says that now that you have turned your gaze inside, you have to focus on your mind.\n\nSo now mind is focused laserized. We have good explanation about the scientific or medical implication of focusing between the eyes. But from a yogic perspective we are focused on Agna chakra. In our bodies we have six chakras. In some tradition there's seventh chakra which is the Sahasrara chakra which is also called Brahmarandra. That's your exit point when you die if you are a yogi.\n\nBhagavan says here that focus on your Ajna chakra. The Agna chakra is also called third eye. In our literature we have Shiva had third eye, the eye of wisdom. So this third eye or Ajna chakra is supposed to be associated with the subtle body, the mind and intellect. So rather than focusing on the world outside, now you focus on the world inside, on your mind and intellect and turn them towards this chakra which is a connection between you and the supreme. So Bhagawan said, Chakshucha Eva Antare bruvaha.\n\nFocus your attention between the two eyebrows with Agna chakra. It's also corresponding to the pineal gland in your physiology. And therefore we also have a bindi in our culture at that point. And also the yogis, they put Chandan tika to keep that Agna chakra protected Prana Panav Samokrutva. We also Learnt in chapter three, I think it was verse 29 which says they offer the prana into Apana or Apana into Prana. One of the Yajnas is this prana upon Yajna which is basically Purak or Kumbak Pranayam.\n\nThere was a great technique developed by all over Rishis. They noticed that my mind affects my breathing. And so if I use that knowledge of my observation that there is a connection between my mind and my breathing, I can control breathing to control my mind, so I can regulate breathing to control my mind. And this whole elaborate science of pranayama was developed. So here it says prana and apana making them equal. There is no imbalance between the two which in turn will control my mind, will make my mind balance Prana Pana Samokratva.\n\nI have read Ganeshwar Maharaj Ganeshwari and it says, combine the power of Prana and apana together and direct it towards your spirit Sahasrara Chakra. So this energy which is right now used for maintaining this body, equalize it. So the body is maintained with a very minimal energy. The rest of the energy is focused towards your Sahastrara chakra where you have a connection with your great self. The energy which we receive from that great self is through that chakra according to the yogic tradition. So Bhagawan says, balance your Prana and Apana NASA Bhyantara Charina which are happening in your nostrils.\n\nYat Indriyaha Manaha Buddhi Munihi Moksha Parayanaha. If you are desirous of liberation, if a goal is to achieve liberation, then you have to make this preparation throughout your life. It is not something that you get up one morning and start meditating. Bhagawan Buddha did not get up early that morning under a Bodhi tree and said, I need to Meditate and achieve enlightenment. He had to work all his life to achieve that enlightenment. This is the practice that has controlled my organs, my senses, my mana, my mind and my buddhis.\n\nThis cannot happen as we know overnight. It also is not going to happen just because you decided to do so. It's a constant practice without any gap in it. Eknathi Swaran used to say that if you miss a day in meditation, it takes a week to make up. And if you miss a week of meditation, it takes a month to make it up. If you miss a month, it takes a year to make it up.\n\nSo it's a constant practice to control your organs, control your mind, control intellect. Now we are all doing it. So it's not something which is not in our control. We control over organs in a sense. We don't behave in an inappropriate manner in the public. We also control our mind.\n\nSometimes we feel like doing something, but we realize it's not the right thing to do. So we control our mind. We control intellect too. Sometimes we get fancy ideas, but then we think, no, that's not the right thing. We do have capabilities. Except our goal is different in using that capability.\n\nWe're trying to achieve something from this world. Here it says Moksha parayanaha. Those who are mumukshu, those who are desirous of liberation, they use this capability to control mind, intellect and body in achieving that liberation. Vigatha Ichabaya krodaha this is only possible if you're without any desire, fear and anger. We know that our life is basically nothing but a permutation combination of these three. Either we are desirous of getting something we are fearful of of something may not get it, or I'm angry.\n\nThat's because my mind is right now turned outside seeking happiness. If I realize that the happiness does not lie outside the world of objects has no capability to give me happiness. As we have seen, every object which gives me happiness has equal capability to give me unhappiness. If that's true, they actually cancels each other out. It is like the particles which have a negative and positive charge. They cancel each other out and they disappear.\n\nThese objects are illusory. They do not have the essential thing which I am seeking happinessah.",
      "reflection": "Practice what the Gita calls 'renunciation in action.' Choose one activity today and do it without any sense of 'I am doing this' or 'this will benefit me.' Just let the action happen through you.\n\nNotice the quality of mind that emerges when personal stake is released. This is true sannyasa—not running away from the world, but engaging fully while remaining free.\n\nThe person established in this wisdom sees the same Self in all beings. Today, practice looking at others—friends, strangers, even those who irritate you—and remembering that the same consciousness that looks out through your eyes looks out through theirs."

So what we have seen in Bhagavad Gita so far is the conclusion of the first set of chapters and we are coming to this culminating chapter, Dhyana Yoga, which will indicate the state which we have to achieve.\n\nSo we have discussed many times that Bhagavad Gita is divided into three distinct sections of each having six chapters. According to Anandagiri, who was a 13th century head of Dwarka Mutt, he said Bhagavad Gita is exposition on the Mahavakya Tattvamasi. The Mahavakya is a statement which connects the lower to the higher, the river to the Paramatma. Tattvamasi is a Mahavakyan Chandogya Upanishad. And according to Anandagiri who wrote Tikas on Bhagavan Sankara's Arya's Bhasyas. So Bhagavan Ved Vyas wrote Bhagavad Gita.\n\nThen Bhagavan Sankaracharya wrote Bhasya on Bhagavad Gita and then Anandagiri wrote Tika on Bhagavan Sankracher as Bhashya. There he says this Bhagavad Gita is exposition on Tattvamasi that thou art. There are other opinions about what Bhagavad Gita is and how it is divided. Madhusuddhan Saraswati, he was 16th, late 16th, early 17th century Advaitic scholar. He said that Bhagavad Gita is divided into three parts, starting with Karma Yoga in the first six chapters, Bhakti Yoga in seven through 12 chapters, and Gnana Yoga in 13th to 18th chapter. Swamiji also points out here that there are others who believe that first six chapters relates to the Karmakanda in Vedas.\n\nNext set of six chapters relates to Upasanakanda in Vedas. In last six chapters relates to Gnanakanda in Vedas. However, Bhagawan Sankaracharya does not make any distinction in his Basya. He simply says the spiritual evolution described in Bhagavad Gita follows. First you act in this world with hankering for the fruits. So you are working in the world with with expectations.\n\nSo in the first Saxon Bhagavan Hatova prapsisi swargam ji tova Bhaksi sevahim. What do you have to lose in performing any action? You shall achieve either the heaven for the heroes if you die, and if you don't die, you will achieve the kingdom on this earth. When you're expecting a result, that's your motivation. The second stage will be to act without any hankering for the fruits of action which we have seen as Karma Yoga. And then the third stage in the spiritual evolution is the integration of the mind with Upasana.\n\nIn the last state, he says, is the realization acquiring the knowledge. So so far what we have seen is in chapter one we have seen the confusion of an ordinary man of this world which we are all. We want to act in this world and get the right results. But we do not know what accents are right. So that's our confusion. Arjun Visa Yuga explained that through the Arjuna's condition, Chapter two give us the philosophical perfection of Upanishads.\n\nThe highest knowledge in Upanishads was given out right away as the goal. Not that Bhagavan Krishna expected Arjuna to understand, but he gave out that knowledge of perfection, that this self is immutable, imperishable. And at the end of the chapter we also saw the characteristics of a man of perfection, a wise person. How would he act in this world? If you achieve the state of perfect wisdom, then you will have a balanced mind to achieve that. Then chapter three gave us the path of Karma Yoga, the method of self integration of our mind and intellect.\n\nThat's the second stage. First you act with the desire for the fruits. Then you act without desire or expectation for the fruit. So that's chapter three. And chapter four actually gives the various means, Bahiranga, Sadhana, the external aids, how to perform Karma Yoga. So we have seen many Yajnas in chapter four.\n\nThen chapter five gave us a technique. Even while working in this world without any expectations, there will be some impact on your mind to avoid that. Chapter five gives you the path of Renunciation that you give up the sense of agency for your actions while performing actions selflessly. Also you must renounce your sense of doership. So that's what we saw in chapter five. Renouncing the sense of agency is the Sannyasa Yoga, Yoga of renunciation.\n\nAnd now all that knowledge, if you have been practicing diligently, then Bhagavan said, you are ready for Dhyana Yoga, Yoga of Meditation. Swamiji says it's a yoga of contemplation. Meditation is a state to reach. Contemplation is way to achieve that. So that is Dhyana Yoga. So you have to prepare yourself with Karma Yoga to get to Dhyana Yoga.\n\nSo chapter literally opens with that statement. Anasritah Karma Falam karyam Karma Karotiyah. One who is performing actions without depending on the fruits of actions, Sahasanyasi cha Yogi, Cha na nir agnihi nacha Akriaha. One who is performing actions without any dependence on the fruits of actions. Such a person is a sannyasi and a yogi. So Bhagawan is now basically relating both the yoga which can be viewed as a Karma Yoga, and sannyas as one and the same.\n\nThe ultimate result is one and the same as long as you perform Karma Yoga without any expectation for the fruits. This is basically clarification. Because we carry baggage of our culture. We see sannyasi as somebody who has given up all activities, one who is completely inactive from a society's perspective. He does not have a job, he does not have a family, he has no relationship, he has given up everything. Sannyasi is the one who renounced everything.\n\nAll means of making living, all possessions, all relationships, including possession of his body. When somebody takes sannyas, he actually performs the last rites. So the one who has decided to take sannyas, he then wears, you know, saffron robe. He's not doing anything. And Bhagavan said, outwardly that person may have taken sannyas, but if he has not given up these fruits of actions, then he's not a Sannyasi Akriaha. He seems inactive, but that does not mean he is a sannyasi Niragniha, one who does not have fire.\n\nSo this fire comes from our Vedic culture where every householder will have a fire in his house. Because fire is necessary for your day to day cooking, but also for the religious rites. All the religious practices or upasanas were done through fire, yagnas, homas. So they used to continually keep fire in the house because they didn't have this instant matches or lighters. So they'll keep a fire burning in the house so that when they need fire, they can use that to light bigger fire. So person who is a householder will always have fire in his house.\n\nAnd sannyasi gives up that responsibility of carrying fire. He doesn't need to cook anymore. Or he also is not performing any religious rites. He's not performing any kind of traditional pujas. Bhagavan clarifies this. A person has given up the grvastha shram.\n\nBut if he is not at a mental level, then he is not a sannyasi. If he has not renounced his sense of agency and fruits of actions, then he is not a sannyasi. It's a clarification that the sannyasa is a state of mind, is a state of renouncing sense of agency. The one who is a yogi is also sannyasi, Sanyasi also yogi. In the next verse, Bhagawan says, yam Sanyasam ITI prahuhu yogam tam vidhi pandava O Pandav. That which is said to be sannyasa.\n\nSannyasa is renouncing the sense of agency. Prahu yogam tam vidyapandava. So that is Dhyana yoga. That with the sannyasa is also yoga. Because without becoming Yogi, one cannot become sanyasi nahi sanyasta, Sankalpah Yogi, Bhavati kastanah. Because without renouncing Sankalpa, Sankalpa, Swamiji says, is difficult word to translate in English.\n\nBut expectations, nahisa nyasta Sankalpaha. One who has not given up expectations, Yogi Bhavati kastanaha, he cannot become yogi. So one who has not given up a fancy of one's mind. That Swamiji elaborates what Sankalpa is. It is confusing for us because in our culture, in our vernacular languages, in our religious practices, you always do Sankalpa before you start any puja. Panditji will say, do Sankalpa.\n\nSo Sankalpa also means termination, taking a vow. When I decide that this action, I'm doing it for this reason, that's a sankalpa. I'm going to be regular in my exercise every day. I'll go for a walk every day as we do on a. I guess a New Year's Eve, a resolution. Because you have a goal in mind, you have a result in mind. But Bhagavan says that this Sankalpa should be given up if you want to become a yogi.\n\nBecause Sankalpa result in future which is exactly contrary to Karma Yoga. Karma Yoga is not to expect any results. Sankalpa is to expect a result in future and then work towards it that there is nothing wrong in it. But human mind is such that Sankalpa does not remain constant. And we all know that every resolution we make on New Year's Eve by the time that month is over, we have forgotten about it and we have some other Sankalpa. So the nature of our mind is to make a Sankalpa for the future.\n\nBut the action can always be performed in present. And before we start that action in present, we move on to the next Sankalpa. We want to do something else. So we never reach a goal. Because the goal is constantly a moving target that the fancy of our mind. So to stop that one has to give up Sankalpa.\n\nOne has to learn how to give up this fancy of a mind. And I heard that you have to learn how to give up Sankalpa to get Sankalpa Siddhi. In a sense you're determined to get something. You work towards it and get it. So you make a Sankalpa. Something which is unattainable.\n\nI want to achieve liberation Moksha unattainable right now. But if you make that Sankalpa then first you have to learn how to give up the other fancy of your mind to give up other Sankalpa and then just work toward the one Sankalpa. Then you can reach that. So learn how to give up Sankalpa so you can achieve Sankalpa Siddhi. So Bhagavan here says is that no one can become Yogi who has not given up Sankalpa. So he is already a renouncer.\n\nHe has given up Sankalpa. He is a Sanyasi and therefore he is Yogi. So Yogi and Sanyasi are one and the same. Then it gives us who should practice what, who is capable of inactivity and who should perform actions. We have already seen that inactivity is not an option for Usta. It's not possible for any living being to be inactive.\n\nBut inactivity is the goal. Then we want Niskarma Siddhi. We want to retire from our day to day life is the goal. So he says Aru Ruksoho munehe Yogam Karma Karanam Uchate Karma is the means for a seeker, A Muni who wants to ascend to yoga, who wants to become yogi. But he is not a yogi yet. For such a person, such a seeker who is not yogi means the one who has the control over his mind is a yogi.\n\nOne who wants to control his mind. But mind is not in control yet. For Karma is prescribed. Remember we have started chapter called Dhyana Yoga. So we expected that Bhagawan just talking about Dhyana, how to meditate, what to do. We are done with Karma Yoga.\n\nNow let's focus on Dhyana Yoga. But Bhagavan really puts Karma Yoga at the highest level here and say unless you have practiced Karma Yoga and achieved the results of the Karma Yoga which is the control of the mind, purification of the mind, the next step is not really for you.",
      "reflection": "Try even five minutes of stillness today. Don't worry about doing it correctly. Simply sit, close your eyes, and notice what's happening in your field of awareness.\n\nWhen the mind wanders—and it will—gently bring it back. This gentle returning is the practice. Each time you notice wandering and return, you're strengthening the muscle of awareness. The Gita is clear: the mind is restless and difficult to control, but through practice and dispassion, it can be mastered.\n\nConsider: What is your relationship with your own mind? Are you its master, or does it control you? The practice of meditation is the practice of reclaiming sovereignty over your own inner world."

      "commentary": "What is my purpose and destiny? We have been discussing Chapter 6, Dhyana Yoga, Yoga of Contemplation and Meditation. In the first five chapters, we have seen that Bhagavan defined the word Yoga. In chapter two, Bhagavan defined the word Yoga, Samatvam Yoga, Uchade Yoga is the balance of mind. And then he said, yoga ha Karma Sukha Vishalam Yoga is dexterity in action. So that basically was given as a goal.\n\nThat yoga is to balance your mind. Your mind should be balanced in all situation and that's your goal. Then the next three chapters, 3, 4 and 5 basically gives two techniques to achieve that yoga of balancing the mind. The one he said Karma Yoga do not depend on the Karma Phala. By giving up the expectations for the results is one technique which we call Karma Yoga. The other technique given was they're giving up the sense of agency which was called sannyasa.\n\nSo in these two techniques we have seen that they have two different modes. One is promoting actions, but without any expectation of the fruits. Other one is promoting inaction. Giving up the sense of agency is giving up actions. I am not doing anything. So for an average person it may seem contradictory.\n\nThe one is promoting actions, other is promoting inaction. Also culturally we have seen that Karma Yogi is engaged in actions where sannyasi has given up all actions. He gives up his job, he gives up his family. So even in olden days, a grahasti was required to perform certain rituals daily that he has to perform at the grahasti. Therefore, as we have seen, he keeps fire in his house, burning all the time because he needs the fire for performing the rituals. But once he becomes a sanyasi, if he takes sanyasi, he is not required to do any of the actions.\n\nSo in the narrow sense, the Karma Kanda says that grahastha is required to perform actions which are ritualistic actions and sannyasi is not required to perform those actions. We have seen these two opposite sides of the same coin, but very contrary to each other. So that can Create confusion in in our mind that tyagi or yogi is better or the sannyasi is better. And therefore the chapter opened with a clear declaration from Bhagavan. Anastirithah Karma, Falam Karyam, Karma, Karotiyah Samyasi Sacha Yogi. So Bhagavan once again extols Karma Yoga as the very means of achieving this balance of mind.\n\nThat one who performs actions without depending on the fruits of action is Yogi and a sannyasi, both because a sannyasa cannot be achieved or yoga cannot be achieved by renouncing actions. And therefore both achieve the same goal of samatwam, the balance of mind which we are looking for. Therefore, Ibwansidha sannyasam, idhi prahuhu Yogamtam, vidhi pandavah. Know that sannyasa is the same thing, what they call Yoga. One who has not given up the Sankalpa, he cannot become Yogi. But depending on progress in your evolutionary process of reaching lower to the higher, you can choose one or the other.\n\nSo in the third verse we have seen Aru ruksho mune Yogam Karma karanamuchate. If you're still not there, you're not establish yourself in Yoga. Then Karma is the means. If I can't balance my mind, I know that I can lose the balance of my mind. When the situation occurs which is not conducive, I think I keep my mind balanced. When things are going well, I act very rationally.\n\nIt's only when things are not going right that I become irrational. The irrationality, Bhagavan says, should shows that you have no control over your mind. Situation affecting you and you blaming the situation. But the root cause is that you have no control over your mind. So the mind is taking away the peace in your inner self. And therefore Bhagawan says, then keep doing actions without expectations.\n\nThat's your exercise. Continue working on that Yoga Rudrasya dasheva samahakaranamuchade. But one who has balanced his mind, one who has achieved a state of yoga for him, Shamah, inactivity, quiescence of mind. The mind has no desire, no thoughts of achieving something. He doesn't become thoughtless. But he does not have really any goal of achieving something which he does not have because it feels complete.\n\nAll our plans for achieving things are because we feel incomplete. Without my car, I'm incomplete. So things which makes me incomplete, I try to achieve from outside the world. When you Feel incomplete and you have to get something out of this world. That's a power of Sankalpa. In your mind you create a situation.\n\nYou really create a scenario that if I have this then I will feel complete. If I come here on any kind of student visa or H1 visa only if I can get green card then everything will be solved. Once I get green card, things will be perfectly fine. That becomes a Sankalpa overarching desire who is considered to be Yogaruda. One who has balanced his mind that he has now control over his mind. Here is the litmus test that if I do not get attached to sense objects, that does not mean that I do not use sense objects.\n\nBut I use them for utility. I feel thirsty and I drink water. I feel hungry and I eat food. But I don't get attached to them. And I have to have this amras every day. That's an attachment.\n\nEnjoying mango juice is not a problem. Getting attached to the taste is a problem. So Bhagawan said one day doesn't attach to the sense objects. He use these sense objects for whatever the utility they provide for maintaining my life but not getting attached to them. If they are not there tomorrow, I will still be the same person. This part is even more difficult.\n\nWe can probably get detached from sense objects, but my own actions. Therefore we have discussed many, many times before. Retiring is not that easy. Something which I get used to doing all my life. I know it very well because I'm not retired yet. It's very difficult to give up actions which you are performing and getting used to them.\n\nThose actions define myself. The first thing comes out of your mouth, I'm an architect because that defines who you are. That's your profession. Oh, I'm a son of such and such. Well, that's your relationship. We continue this inquiry of defining ourselves and we miserably fail in the end.\n\nBecause everything we define ourselves is some kind of a relationship, some kind of a acquisition, some kind of position, but not really who you are. That Bhagavan says is attachment to your actions. You call yourself an architect because you're attached to your profession. You call yourself a father because you're attached to your relationship with your. Those attachments are to my actions, not to the sense objects. I'm not attached to my son.\n\nI'm not attached to my actions, my profession. That's attachment action. See both Somebody has given up. That does not mean he does not have a relationship or he doesn't work. But he considered that as part of this world where I have to function. Sarvasankalpa Sanyasi.\n\nSo these words come time and again. And therefore we obviously have to understand them as thoroughly as we can. So Sankalpa, the word comes in our culture all the time. As we discussed last time. When you go to do puja, Panditji will ask you to make Sankalpa that this puja, I'm doing it for such and such. The Sankalpa is Samyak Kalpana.\n\nAnd the word samyak literally means overarching, which encompass everything. That is Samyak kalpana. When there is an overarching desire in my mind that I want to get this, that's Sankalpa. Firm determination that my happiness lies there and I must get it. So therefore Panditji says, when you are doing a puja, you have to Sankalpa Samyak Kalpana that by doing this puja I shall get this. Our mind does that Sankalpa all the time.\n\nThe only problem is it continues to change. Sankalpa Bhagawan said, this mind has this capacity to jump from one Sankalpa to another Sankalpa. And that creates variety of desire. In Mahabharata there's a statement which says, kamaha janame te mulam. I know your roots, that your roots are Sankalpa. I know that you are born out of Sankalpa, the desire which is defining me.\n\nSo Upanishad also says, the self is nothing but the identification with desire which I consider to be me. In Mahabharata it says, O desire. You are born after Sankalpa. And therefore I will never think about it. So you will be destroyed with your own roots. If I don't have Sankalpa, I don't think I am a Sankalpa.\n\nThen there won't be any desire. And I can kill the desire. Sarva Sankalpa sanyasi. Therefore, the word Sarva Sankalpa is constantly changing. We constantly change our overarching desire. Today this is what I want to achieve, and then tomorrow it changes.\n\nUnless we curb that urge to create new Sankalpa, I cannot become a Sanyasi. So he said, serve a Sankalpa Sannyasi, one who has given up all Sankalpas. Yoga Rudhata Duchate. That person is considered established in Yoga. If I feel complete, I will not Have a desire to achieve anything overarchingly. I will have needs and I'll fulfill my needs.\n\nI need water because I'm thirsty. I need food because I'm hungry. I need job because I need to make a living. Those are normal things we do. But when there is Sankalpa is this is what I need to get so that I feel happy. Bhagwan says that Sankalpa and one who gives up that sense of Sankalpa he becomes Yogarudhata Duche.\n\nIf you find yourself in that situation that now you have no desire to achieve anything. Bhagawan said you are Yoga Ruda at that point. Samahakarana Uchati for such a person, inactivity. And in fact from the scriptural point of view the time comes when you have to stop your activity. So Swamiji says here it is a sin not to act when you are required to act. But it is also equally dangerous if you continue acting when you're not required to act.\n\nAnd therefore we used to have those ashrams, Brahmacharyashram, Grahasthashram, Vanapastha, Asram Sanyata Ashram. You have to reach a point in your life where inactivity is your goal. And then start working not for the self but on the self. So start working on your own self. Udharat Atmana Tmanam Na tmanam avasadayat. It seems like there are two me.\n\nOne is watching me and one is working me. That watching me is constantly deciding what needs to be done. So what we call our own conscience that we feel this is right. But then my my pragmatic thought says no, that may not be very useful. So let's go and do that. This watching me is the my higher self.\n\nOr consider that which has a clear vision of what is right and what is wrong that is constantly watching me. Therefore I think I should have a cup of tea. There are two I one who thinks, one who wants cup of tea. So this watching me is the one who can guide you. And Bhagavan said Udharit Atmana tmanam. Let your lower self, lower self.\n\nThe working me to be raised out of this Sansar, this Jagat which is constantly changing. Raise that lower set working me by the help of their watching me. Then my own conscience can help me get out of the sorrows of day to day life. If I become friend with that, if I listen to that voice. Na tmanam avasadayat. Don't let this working me drown in this World of sorrows and day to day rut atmevahi atmano banduhu that watching me can be my friend if I allow him to be my friend.",
      "reflection": "Try even five minutes of stillness today. Don't worry about doing it correctly. Simply sit, close your eyes, and notice what's happening in your field of awareness.\n\nWhen the mind wanders—and it will—gently bring it back. This gentle returning is the practice. Each time you notice wandering and return, you're strengthening the muscle of awareness. The Gita is clear: the mind is restless and difficult to control, but through practice and dispassion, it can be mastered.\n\nConsider: What is your relationship with your own mind? Are you its master, or does it control you? The practice of meditation is the practice of reclaiming sovereignty over your own inner world."

      "commentary": "Unlike a car with its user's manual, we are born without instructions how to live. We experience life vicissitudes without a so called user's manual. The Gita has been described as such a guide. Okay, so last time we have seen that the advice from Bhagavad Gita is Raise yourself by the self, Don't let the self fall. Raise yourself by the self. We all really know in life that the only one who can really help oneself is one's own self.\n\nOnly my own efforts will raise me out of the situation I'm in. But the connotation here is that raise your lower self by the higher self, the self in me, which remains constant all throughout all these changes of birth and death, as we have seen in last chapter two, that is imperishable, immutable, untaintable. Let that self raise your lower self which is suffering right now by its own limitations. I can't stand limitations because my true nature is limitless, limitless. So now the only thing I can do is let my higher self raise my lower self to the same level the higher self is. So say, raise yourself by yourself.\n\nDon't let yourself fall. Don't let your lower self go even further down. And that's because it says the higher self is a friend of the lower self. When this lower self is conquered by the higher self, when the lower self starts identifying with the higher self, recognizing its existence, there is something beyond my this day to day life which I live. There is something beyond the life which I consider started at my birth and will end at my death. When I start recognizing this and make that higher self a friend of this lower self, I'll be able to pull the lower self out of its present state of misery.\n\nBut it said the same self, higher self, can be the enemy of the lower self. If my ego fails to recognize that there is something beyond my this limited self, then the same higher self will act as if it's enemy because it will let you go down further and further into this misery. By empowering you to do the wrong thing. Higher self will empower you to do whatever you wish you to do. If the ego goes down into the lower and lower plane of existence, it will be empowered by the same higher self. Just as a car out of control is empowered by the same gas which is in the tank which was making it go straight on the road in a controlled fashion.\n\nSame gas will be the power which will create a disastrous wreck. So the advice was clearly, raise yourself by the self. But he said, to do that you have to have certain qualifications. You have to make your efforts to raise your lower self to a worthiness that it can start working with the higher self. It can start identifying with the higher self. So the verses which we discussed 7, 8 and 9 describes the state of Yoga Rudha.\n\nOne who has become one master of his self. You know, master of his lower self, Yoga Rudha. We have seen two Arurukshaha and Yoga Rudha. Someone who is desirous to gain that control over his mind, body and intellect. For them the advice was karma karanamuchade. Keep working in this world with selfless motivation and you will achieve that.\n\nBut once you reach that state where you have that control over that, then they shamaha karana mucha there at that point, the contemplation and meditation to now get to the higher level. To achieve the goal of that eternal happiness. We want to get out of the limitations. I want to be happy all the time. Bhagawan said, it is absolutely possible only when you identify with the higher, not the lower. You are the manifestation of the higher.\n\nBut my identification right now is with the lower. As long as I don't identify with the lower, its limitations cannot affect me. It is like when you go to the science museum or some place where there is funny mirror are there. I stand in front of it and I look like I have bloated 10 times than what I am today. Well, as long as I don't identify that image in the mirror, I am fine. Everybody goes in a funny mirror and laugh at it.\n\nBecause they are not identifying with the image they see in the mirror. They clearly identify with the self which is standing in front of the mirror. That's why they can laugh at it. But once one who identifies with that, he cannot laugh. Our situation, Bhagavan says, like we are looking at ourselves in this funny mirror and looking at this miserable self. And now we are in misery.\n\nBut one who identifies with the real self which is standing in front of the mirror, the higher self which makes this lower self possible is without any miseries. So the one who has achieved that sense of balance over himself has now become the Yoga Rudha. What will he gain is what we learned. In last three verses it says jitath manah prasantashya paramatma Samahitaha Sita ushna sukha dukeshu tathamana apamana Yoho. Where do our problems lie? In all the trees which we have seen here.\n\nPhysical condition is not comfortable. Room is too hot or too cold, you know. So at the body level I can be be uncomfortable displeasure. At a mental level, I feel this is good time going on or I don't have a good time these days things are not working out for me. At a mental level, the Mana apamana Yoho honor and dishonor. Intellectually, I feel that people are now respecting me.\n\nI have achieved something or dishonor, they're not respecting. All these are cause for pleasure and pain in life. But one who has achieved that Yoga Rudha state, in other words, one who has become one with his higher self, has recognized the existence of the higher self in him and start aligning himself with the higher self for him. Prasantasya Paramatma. His self is remains equanimous in all this situation because I am not identifying with it. We wrongly understand that the one who has become this evil, he will not turn on the temporary thermo thermostat adjusted because so what it is uncomfortable.\n\nWell, that's a sheer foolishness. It if I have the facility here to adjust the temperature to my level of comfort, then I should do it. Swami Chinmaynda, people used to ask him all the time, swami, you talk about all this detachment and all that, but when you come, people come and pick you up in Lexus and BMWs and Jaguars. And why don't you go with somebody who has a broken car? Swamiji says, my friend, I'm a swami. That doesn't mean I'm completely stupid.\n\nAs long as there is a more reliable and comfortable vehicle available, why should I choose one which is completely unreliable and uncomfortable? That's a common sense. It has nothing to do with attachment or detachment. So we wrongly perceive that the person who has achieved has to suffer. Then only he is considered. It simply says the self in him, the higher self in him is prasantasya is always at equanimity.\n\nIt not disturbed by the outside happening. Whatever is happening in the body level, I see that is happening clearly at the body level and let the body deal with it at its own capacity. Whatever is happening at the mental level, I see clearly that's happening at the mental level. Let the mind deal with it at its own capacity and what will happen in the intellectual level, Let it happen at intellectual. Let my intellect deal with it its own capacity. But I, the self, the balance of my core never gets shaken by this happening in this world.\n\nThat's why I always say there are no riots when there's 102° outside in Richmond. We didn't have any people throwing stones at Richmond City hall. What's happening here 102° we didn't anticipate, we expected that, we accepted that, that that can happen. Deal with it with the best situation we can create. So we all turned down our thermostat and let the air condition run as best as it can. But we didn't get upset, we didn't have anything to complain to because we knew that it is something beyond my control.\n\nWhen a yogi becomes one with his higher self he sees all the occurring at the mental level, the physical level and the intellectual level occurring at the lower level of existence. But higher self is not involved and does not get attached to it. It's not affected by any of this thing. So that's his fulfillment. Because of becoming Yogarudha is not now disturbed by this small thing which used to disturb me before. Before it is hot, we are complaining all over the place.\n\nWhen it is not conducive complain. Now I can take it as is and look at it as a transitory phase of happening in my life, in my existence and don't get disturbed by it. The next was you say gnana vignana triptatma kutasthah vijatendriyaha yukta itiuchate Yogi sama losta ashma kanchanaha. This is the verse I never understood ever when I was growing up and have started learning Bhagavad Gitas since I was about 18 years old. And I say wow, what is my attitude in life if that's the case that I am become sama losta asma kanchanaha. The lump of clay, the iron and the gold, I become equanimous to it.\n\nWell that means I have lost all kind of judgment in life. You know, I don't know what truly want well, it really doesn't say that in your day to day transactions in this world that you do not make any differentiation between the usefulness or a value of one thing or the other. But it does tell me that one who has achieved the sense of understanding, one who has the knowledge, Gnana. Gnana is something which I learn from others, from the books, from the teachers, from my listening, I receive the knowledge. But that knowledge remains at a bookish knowledge till I apply it and make it my own. That becomes vignana.\n\nThat was science saved laboratories. You know, you go into the. You learn in the classroom and say H2O is water. Then you go to the lab and make it on your own with two molecules of hydrogen and one oxygen and say the water. Now I'm absolutely convinced. That's now my wisdom.\n\nVignana visishtagnana. That only comes with self experience. Experimenting what I have learned in my own life, I get wisdom. That's why I didn't understand when I was 18. Now at 62, it is very clear, okay? Because I have gone through the experimentation of it in life.\n\nSo it says Gnana Vignana, Truptatma Kutastha. And kutastha whatever. I think it comes from that anvil in the smithy shop. That blacksmith is hammering something on that anvil that both are made up of iron. But the one changes its shape and will remain the same. So Kutastha, he remains unshaken by whatever is happening on that.\n\nWho has the control over his senses. You know, Yuktaiti Uchathe. Such a person is called fulfilled yukta or harmonized or one who has achieved the sense of his self. Satchin Yogi sama losta Ashma Kanchanaha. He sees the lump of clay, the iron and the gold is same. He sees the same as its original value.\n\nWhat is the value of gold? What is the value of my house? Well, we put this place for lease or sell or whatever. So what is the value? Well, I may want anything I want.",
      "reflection": "Try even five minutes of stillness today. Don't worry about doing it correctly. Simply sit, close your eyes, and notice what's happening in your field of awareness.\n\nWhen the mind wanders—and it will—gently bring it back. This gentle returning is the practice. Each time you notice wandering and return, you're strengthening the muscle of awareness. The Gita is clear: the mind is restless and difficult to control, but through practice and dispassion, it can be mastered.\n\nConsider: What is your relationship with your own mind? Are you its master, or does it control you? The practice of meditation is the practice of reclaiming sovereignty over your own inner world."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter six, Dhyana Yoga Yoga of Meditation. In first five chapters we learned about ourselves. We learned the terms Yogi and sannyasi. So in this chapter we've learned so far that the one who is acting in this world without depending on the fruits of actions is a yogi and also a sannyasi. Because a sannyasi cannot be a sannyasi unless he has given up all the sense of agency. A Yogi cannot be a yogi until he gives up all the Sankalpas Sarva Sankalpa Sanyasi.\n\nSo both reach the same state of becoming equanimous to all the happenings around them. And Bhagavan said, the one who has not yet achieved the state of Yoga, Arudha. So we are seekers, the seeker. The prescription is to selfless actions. Karma Karanam Uchathe. But one, you are established in Yoga then Shamah Karanamuchate then controlling your mind is your pursuit to achieve the higher level.\n\nHow do I know that I have become established in yoga? You see, once you get detached from your actions and also the sense objects, when you are completely detached from the world of objects and also world of your activities, in other words, you are functioning but not having that attachment to it. When you achieve that state Sarva Sankalpa Sanyasi there are no aspirations to achieve anything or to accomplish anything. Seems like a pretty dangerous state of mind. But in other words, you know what needs to be done and you will be doing it, but without any anxiety about what will come out of it. So when you teach that state, then your Yoga Rudha.\n\nBut how do I get to that point where Bhagavan said, let yourself lift yourself. Let your higher self lift this lower self to that level that they both become aligned with each other. Right now my identification is the lower self, which is we have defined as my body, mind and intellect. This limited being I consider to be me in all my pursuits. To achieve happiness is through this limited being. Limited being limited.\n\nIt cannot achieve infinite happiness. But I miss that equation that Something that finite cannot achieve anything that is infinite. I am constantly pursuing infinite happiness, infinite bliss, infinite state where there is no sorrow, using the equipment which are finite. So once you align yourself with that higher self which is infinite, you will be achieve your goal. So let your higher self lift your lower self to a level that is aligned with it. And then the caution was that that higher self can be your enemy or a friend.\n\nDepending on whether I have control over my self, my senses, my mind. If I have no control over mind and senses, higher self enable me to do whatever my lower self wants to do and then it will be a disaster. So now the higher self is acting as an enemy because it's allowing me to do things which are not good for me. So once I have understood that the higher self is there to enable me to achieve higher goals and align with it, it will become my friend. Once I have achieved that state, what will happen? We have learned that then one becomes in a state of equanimity.\n\nHis self remains same in a Sita, Ushna, Sukhada, Kamana or Pramana. At the level of physical being, at the level of mental being or intellectual being. My connection with the higher remains the same. In other words, that I do not identify with what's happening with my body, mind and intellect. I continue to identify with my higher self which remains as a witness to what's happening. Therefore it is not getting affected.\n\nWhen I see that things are happening to the people around me but I am not affected, then I am a witness. I had heard long time ago a definition of a recession and depression. It's when your neighbour gets laid off, it's a recession. So when is it depression? When you get laid off, it's a depression. As long as I'm not affected.\n\nIt's a good topic to talk about. So as long as I don't identify with what's happening, it does not affect me. So as long as my self is constantly identifying with the higher self, whatever happening at the physical level, mental level, intellectual level, it does not get affected. Then he will also become one with all the beings in their relationship. Gnana, Vignana, Trupta, Tatna, Kutastha, Vijayat Tendriaha, Yuktai, Dvuchate, Yogi, Samalosta, Asma Kanchanaha. He sees everything in the physical world as the objects are the same.\n\nHe knows that there is no inherent value in anything. Value is what I assign the value to. As long as I know this is a million dollar Diamond. There is a value because I can sell it. But if I do not know what their value is, it is no different than a costume jewelry. So values are what I assign to it, the world assigned to it.\n\nBut there is no inherent value in anything or being. That's the person with the alignment of the higher self. Then we are saying that even in his relationship, Suhan, mitra, Hari, udasin, madhyas, all different types of people we deal with in our life. Some are friends, some are foes, some are indifferent, some are relatives. But we see them all equally. In other words, they are all manifestation of the same self.\n\nSo this is the state described of a yogi. But we are not at this stage. So prescription is, continue doing selfless actions for the purification of your mind and intellect. When the internal instrument becomes pure, you start seeing your connection with the higher, that inner voice which is so feeble right now, you'll hear it loud and clear. How to get there is what the next few _Verses_ tells us, a detailed description of the practices one can practice. Now, last time we had this description about whether this meditation is for the yogis or for anybody.\n\nAnd I guess there is a question about whether we understand what meditation is. So the meditation is the final state. So if you take Patanjali's Yoga Sutra, there are eight different states before you get to the state of meditation. Start with Yama, Niyama, asana, pranayama, Pratyahar, dharana, and then come. So we have to go through all these different steps to get to a level where we are ready for meditation. But that does not mean that you don't have to start anywhere.\n\nSo you have to start at some place, wherever you are in your journey, one step at a time. And then you have to discipline yourself, which is where the yama, which is restrained. Niyama is the practice in anything. What really matters is a constant practice. When I used to work for large companies, these marketing people, before you go for an interview, they say, well, let's have a rehearsal. And some of us will feel, I've been doing it for years, why do I have to practice?\n\nThey say, no, no, Neel, do the rehearsal one time and we are done. Practice, practice and practice some more. Then only you will be able to present it flawlessly when you go there. So in anything, practice, practice and practice some more is the key. Most of us will say, I tried that. And when obviously it's not working for me.\n\nBut how long have you tried? It's a couple of days. Well, obviously there is no way to judge what you can achieve if you continue to practice. But practicing how is as important. We sometimes say that somebody has 10 years of experience, but it may be a one year experience. He never progressed to the next level very first year.\n\nWhatever he learned, he keeps doing it next 10 years and say, I have 10 years of experience. So you have to learn how to start in the right manner and then make progress. To start from the right manner, we need to learn how to do it. So the next three _Verses_ teach us how to start that journey. Yogi Yunjita, satatatam, atmanam, rahasisthitah, ekaki yata, chittatma, nirasihi parigraha. This is the description about how the yogi should live in one verse.\n\nNow, the yogi who has established himself is yogarudha. He has already gone through the other things we have talked about. He is not attached to the world of objects. He is not attached to his activities. He reached that state. Now he wants to attain that final connection with the self.\n\nSo he said, let the yogi try constantly to keep the mind steady. Probably half an hour a day. So what about the next 23 and a half hours is I let my mind go wherever it wants to go. So what would be more prominent on your mind? The one which you've done in 23 and a half hours or the one you did for half an hour? Of course, the 23 and a half hours will be predominant on your mind.\n\nWhat will be the nature of your mind, what you do for next 23 and a half hours? So the goal here is to open all 24 hours should be the same. Let the yogi try constantly. Keep the mind steady. Remaining in solitude. Remaining in solitude.\n\nMentally in solitude. You may be in a marketplace, but your goal always remains. How my mind is connected, myself is connected. Swamiji gives a standard example of mother in a child. A mother with an infant child. Child may be in the next room and she is in a kitchen and she is doing whatever she is doing.\n\nBut her mind is completely attuned to the child. Even the slightest noise she will recognize. In those days they didn't have those monitors we have here so that you can put a monitor all over the house. But her mind is so tuned to that baby that other people can't hear. Because mind is constantly focused on where the baby is and what it is doing. A yogi becomes like that he may be doing whatever but his mind is constantly aligned towards his self and the conditions given which will allow him to do this.\n\nHe never consider himself to be attached to all these people around him. Yata Chitta TMA he is balanced in his Chitta in atma, the self and the thinking entity. Nirashihi without any asa this is where we get lost here and maybe not for us. I have too many things to accomplish. Nirashihi he does not have anything to accomplish outside in the world. He may be accomplishing a lot, but that accomplishment is not going to give him anything more for his connection to his higher self.\n\nSo he's constantly focused on his connection. So therefore he has no other desire that getting this out of this world will make me more appropriate to achieve my supreme happiness. Parik Graha Having anything to possess. All my possessions are of no value when it really comes to my understanding of myself. I may be a billionaire, but happiness cannot be bought by billion dollars. What I'm seeking for is infinite happiness.\n\nI have come to the conclusion anything which is finite is not going to give me happiness. Therefore, acquiring things to get happiness. I have come to the conclusion is not a good idea. I may acquire things for other reason. To support my body, my mind, my intellect, my relatives, my friends. For them I'm doing this.\n\nBut not for me to get happiness. I'm not buying happiness by acquiring things. That clear idea is in my mind. My possessing thing is not going to give me happiness. I have come to the conclusion that I have tried this before.",
      "reflection": "Try even five minutes of stillness today. Don't worry about doing it correctly.

      "commentary": "Unlike a car with its user's manual, we are born without instructions how to live. We experience life vicissitudes without a so called user's manual. The Gita has been described as such a guide. We had been discussing chapter six, Dhyana Yoga Yoga of Meditation. We have so far understood that the Yogi is trying to achieve the state of mind where he is not attached to either the sense objects or his actions, or he does not have any grand plans for the future. To achieve this state of mind, one obviously have to turn one's gaze to the inner self and stop let the mind running out to the outer world.\n\nThe nature of the mind is obviously to go after the sense objects because it is receiving the information from the senses, senses, reports to the mind. And mind wants to go out and analyze those experiences in the world of sense objects. For this mind to train to turn inward is the training of meditation. And we have seen that Bhagavan has given a clear instruction of how to start this practice. Obviously anything which we are doing and we want to change it, you have to make it a practice, a habit. I heard somewhere that if you do something seven times, it becomes a habit.\n\nAnd I have personally experienced that if I get up one day at 6:30 and it seems too early the next day, I try a little harder and still get up at 6:30. And then after a while that becomes my normal routine that I'll get up at 6:30. So the mind gradually gets used to what we do in a routine manner, or we do it repeatedly. My mind is a flow of thoughts. In whatever direction we turn it, that's the direction the mind will start flowing into. Right now the mind has been trained since my birth to go out to the outside world and gather information whether that experience is conducive or not conducive, whether it is a pleasant or unpleasant experience.\n\nAnd my happiness or unhappiness right now is defined by my experiences which are either conducive or unconducive, pleasant or unpleasant. Dhyana Yoga is the practice to turn this mind away from this outer experiences and experience the inner self. So so far we have seen that the instruction is given that having lived the life of a selfless activity. In other words, I have now changed my priorities in my life. Where whatever I'm doing, I will be thinking about the greater good. Then I will think about not only practicing this art for making money or making my living, but also how good I can make the others lives.\n\nMy clients will be using these buildings. Whether have I improved their lives. And that will be my motivation in practicing my art. If I train my mind to think that way for everything I do, my activities start becoming more selfless than selfish. More and more I practice my selfless activities. My mind becomes purer and purer and seeing the world outside.\n\nBut I have yet not trained itself to turn inward to see what is the experience of myself. And that's where the meditation come in place. So the instruction we have seen in last few _Verses_ it says such. Establish a place of your own meditation which is steady and firm. Naati uchritam naati nicham that it is not too tall, not too low. And once I've established my place of meditation, I've become comfortable on that asana.\n\nAnd I sit down with my folded legs or any other position which is most comfortable. The whole goal is to make my body so comfortable that my mind does not run towards discomfort of my body. My mind gets used to sitting at that place and realizing that now is the time to contemplate and meditate. I'm training my mind. I'm programming my mind that once I sit down at this place, it is time to meditate. So the next instruction was, what do I do once I sit down?\n\nI sit down, I close my eyes lightly. And then the instructions say tatra ekagramana kutva. Then focusing the mind at a single point, Yatachatta indriya kriyah. That controlling the senses. I'm not letting my eyes to see, my ears to hear, or my skin to feel any touch. And I will be practicing this for the purpose of atma vishuddaye, for purifying my internal instrument.\n\nI keep this goal in mind at the seat of meditation. That I am doing this for my internal the purification of my internal instrument. Antakarana, my mind and intellect, the operating system of myself, which is my mind and intellect. So the next three _Verses_ gives us further instructions into what would be the most appropriate posture to achieve that. So the verse 13 says, Samam kaya shirogrivam dharayan achalam sthiraha. I sat down, I closed my eyes, but I'm trying to focus my mind and I feel the weight of my body.\n\nIt's slouching me down and slumping me down and that distracts me. I have never understood this before. I joined Chinmaya Mission and started hearing and learning about meditation. But I heard Swamiji saying that the most comfortable position will be to sit erect. If you want to sit at the seat of meditation, not only that you have to have a right, right seat, but you have to right posture so that you can sit without any stress and strain or having any discomfort in your body in the posture which is most natural, most natural posture. And I now understand more as an architectural statement that if I have the column straight, it will have less stress because I'm transferring all the load on that column straight to mother Earth.\n\nBut if I have a bent column and I'm putting a load on the second floor at the top of that column, that column actually will have more stresses and strain. And I have to design it in a way that it has more reinforcement and all different type of calculations to make sure that the column remains in place. So simple fact in our normal structural knowledge that if I have a straight column, it requires less strength and because it will, less strain of the load coming on top of it or load imposed on it. Now this actually applies to our body too, because our body is nothing but a structure, just like any building structure. So when we are sitting down, our backbone, if it is bent, it will put more stress on it to keep itself in place. The stress and strain will then eventually transfer to my mind and to start thinking about how do I become comfortable under this stress and strain.\n\nSo I need to create a posture which is the most natural in nature is to have a straight column. My backbone should be completely straight. So therefore it says Samam kaya shira grivam. Keep the head, neck and the body in a straight line. It's an observation by our rishis that this is the most comfortable position for our self, our body. It will less strain if you work on your posture and all the time make sure that you are sitting straight.\n\nYou will realize that the most comfortable position and you can sit in that position for a longer period of time without feeling any stress on your body. And this comes straight from Bhagavad Gita Samam Kaya Shirogrivam Having your body, neck and head in this straight line. Dharayan hold it Achalam. Dharayan, hold it Achalam without moving. Once again, let's go back to my own architectural training. If I have a column which had the wind load applied on it and it is moving in the wind now, I learned that to my surprise when I started working on high rise buildings, that all high rise buildings actually kind of sway in the wind just like a tree moves in the wind.\n\nWe typically think the buildings are stable and they don't move. But all buildings move just like a tree would move in a wind. So in a high rise building which are about 50, 60, 70 stories tall or more, they literally move in a wind just like a tree would move. And I even have heard that people get seasickness on the, on the top floors of high rise, those who are very, very sensitive to movement. Because at the top floor, if you are in a hundred story building or 110 story building and you are on a 110th floor, the movement may be in feet. You know, the building moves several feet from one side to another.\n\nAnd people who are sensitive, most people don't, may not feel it. But some people who are very sensitive start feeling their movement, they develop something similar to seasickness. So in other words, if the column was straight, no other force is applied on it and not moving, it is the, it has the least stresses. But now the building I am anticipating is going to move in the wind on a high rise building. The engineer has to calculate that movement and apply those forces on it so that it's going to remain steady at the wind load applied on it. And he has to add more, reinforcing more strength to this column to remain intact in that condition.\n\nSo one more time, our backbone in our body, when it is moving, it requires more stress and strain or experiences more stress and strain and eventually that transfers to our mind. If I want to have my mind completely relieved of any kind of a thinking, I need to relieve it from any stress or strain coming from my body. So Bhagavan says Dharayan Achalam, without moving firmly, hold this posture of having the head, neck and the body in this straight line without moving firmly. That does not mean I will have a stiff posture that I'm trying not to move, but naturally achieve that firmness, but in a most relaxed manner. Now I have the seat sat down on it, I held my body in a firm position, I have a posture corrected, I'm in a straight line My backbone is completely straight. How do I control my mind?\n\nAt one point I'll have to give my mind something to think about, something to focus on. The next line says some preksha nasika agram swam gaze at your own nose tip. Somebody will say, but Neil, my eyes are closed, how am I going to gaze at my nose tip? Well, you're not really seeing, you are trying to focusing on it. So with your eyes closed, focus your mind at the tip of your nose. You are not seeing it, you are imagining it.\n\nFocusing your mind at the tip of your nose. Some prakshinasika agram swam di sahacha an Avalokayan without seeing in the other directions. Our mind has a very imaginative nature. So when you close your eyes, the first thing mind does is well, I can't see now but let me imagine what's around me. What if I look on right? What must be happening?\n\nWould I look on the left? What must be happening? What could be behind me and what could be ahead of me? This nature of imagining things, we need to stop my mind to do. Therefore I'm trying to focus my mind at the tip of my nose and not letting it go in all other direction. So the verse 13 has told us how to sit erect, hold the body firm then gaze at the tip of your nose with your eyes lightly closed and not let the mind try to imagine what's on the other side.\n\nIn the next verse say this.",
      "reflection": "Try even five minutes of stillness today. Don't worry about doing it correctly. Simply sit, close your eyes, and notice what's happening in your field of awareness.\n\nWhen the mind wanders—and it will—gently bring it back. This gentle returning is the practice.

      "commentary": "Unlike a car with its user's manual, we are born without instructions how to live. We experience life vicissitudes without a so called user's manual. The Gita has been described as such a guide. We obviously have been discussing the Yoga of Meditation. We went through several chapters with the Karma Yoga, then culminating the Karma into Wisdom and then Sannyasa Yoga. And now we are saying Dhyana Yoga, the Yoga of Meditation.\n\nAnd we have so far seen that all that we are doing this is for the Atma Sudhaye, for the purification of my internal instrument, that my mind and intellect, which is the internal instrument, that's the only task I have as a seeker, is to purify my mind and intellect and then my real self will shine through. Then I will realize who I am, the peace which I had been seeking all my life. Bhagavan said in the last verse we have discussed that you will then achieve that Santim Nirvana Paramam Matsanstam Adhiyachadi. In the verse 15 which we discussed, as I discussed last time, it said, having gone through this and you have done this, this Yoga of meditation, which is to how to control your mind, how to sit still, control your body, control your senses, control your mind and then focus on yourself, then focus on me as your supreme goal. Then you will find that peace which you had been looking all your life. That's because that peace resides in me, the supreme self.\n\nThe peace I'm seeking in this world does not exist in this world. And therefore me seeking the peace in this world is something like if, let's say for there is a one weekend at King's Dominion, there is a free ride that you can take as many rides as many times, no tickets needed or no attendants are going to stop you from taking that ride over and over again. We go on that roller coaster ride because this is a great chance. I know it's a lot of fun and here it is that there is no restriction. How many times I can take it. So I go on the roller coaster and while I'm going through the roller coaster, I'm constantly thinking, well, if this thing can stabilize, I'll really feel good about it.\n\nBoy, it is going up and down. I can't even predict when it's going to go up and when it's going to come down. If it just stabilizes, I'll feel good about it. But because of my desire to have this fun, I'm not getting off the roller coaster. And after all, I get so engrossed into this, I don't even realize when it stops and starts again. And I'm constantly thinking, if this stabilizes, I may feel a little better about it.\n\nAt that point, some roller coaster guru can come and say, if you really want it stabilized, why don't you get off the roller coaster when it stops next time? So I said, what do I need to do? I said, well, just focus on when it stops. When it stops, you get out and then you'll be in a stable ground, which is what your real place is on a stable ground. That's where you were before. Before you decided you want to have this unlimited fun on this roller coaster.\n\nBecause there is no fee today. There is no restriction how many times you can take it. You say, well, I'll basically take it as long as I can stay there. But in that goal, I forgot that what I'm seeking is stability. That's my true nature. That's what I'm daily living.\n\nBut in that quest for getting this unlimited fun in what I always thought is a great fun, but I did not go there because it cost so much. Now that my chance to do it free, I'm on a roller coaster constantly seeking for the stability which does not exist in roller coaster. Very nature of roller coaster is to go up and down. So some guru comes and said, just focus on yourself. When you see a little stability, that's where the roller coaster stops. And then you will find that stability which you had been seeking all throughout this roller coaster will be yours because it resides outside this roller coaster.\n\nBhagavan says the Santi Nirvana Paramam, that santhi which only gets when you are liberated from this rat of this limited being, trying to seek happiness and peace in this world outside. You will achieve that because your mind and intellect is now pure to experience the joy which resides in the self. And once you unite with that self, Matsangstham Adigacchati, you will achieve that state of mind. And then the last three verses which you've seen, which is 16, 17 and 18. And it said, what we tend to think is, well, I need to live my life as I'm living. But then I need to have like 15 minutes in the morning.\n\nI'm going to meditate, you know, and then I've achieved this state of paramshanti. Well that absolutely is a false notion. To do a meditation, you have to prepare for doing meditation. So how do we prepare for it? The Bhagavan says that the yoga is not possible for people who leave life without any control. I live undisciplined life.\n\nAnd then I say, then I sit down and do yoga. A lot of people have this strong notion that I am living this dynamic life of working for 18 hours a day. But because I have 15 minutes of meditation then I can go on for another 18 hours. Bhagavan clearly says that that's not the reality. You live a life which is hectic and uncontrolled. You will not be able to meditate at all.\n\nAnd therefore it says Na nati athi Asna tastu Yoga aste. One who eats too much for him. In other words, if I'm indulging in the sense gratifications, Yoga is not possible. Also not possible for one who doesn't eat at all. One who is completely avoiding any of this fulfillment for this body. So one is not eating at all.\n\nOne is eating too much is also not possible for him. One is not eating at all. It is not possible for him. It clearly says that torturing my body and senses unnecessarily will not make me any more worthy of meditation than a person who is moderately living life and leave a disciplined life. You know, Nacha ATI Swapna Shila shya Swapna shil Swapna. One who is engaged in swapna.\n\nDreaming is only possible when you're sleeping. So you see, one who is Swapna silhou now Swapna silhu. I can be Swapna seal while I'm waking in this world also. Because from the point of Vedanta, the Swapna extends from my dream world into the waking world. Waking world is nothing but another glorified dream. From the Vedanta's perspective then Najas Swapna Shila Siya who is sleeping too much in this or not sleeping at all.\n\nJagrato Nayva Charjana or constantly awake in this world More engaged in this world, not taking enough sleep or not eating at all. Anything which is extreme is to be avoided by oneself because it will not give you the purity of yourself, the control over yourself to focus your mind. And it's very enlightening that this is not something which is a sacred knowledge which only learn from Bhagavad Gita. People learn on their own when they want to achieve something. You know, we definitely will say, well tomorrow I cannot do this because I have to wake up early and do this. I'm not coming to that party or I'm not going to late night movie if I'm serious about what I'm going to do next day.\n\nI saw two interviews on TV by two Bollywood stars which I probably wouldn't think that has ever gone to any of the schools of philosophy. Both of them are basically known for their good looks like Akshay Kumar and John Abraham. I heard them on short interviews and the first thing they said is that how do you do that? I live a very disciplined life. Now you won't think that you will hear from a Bollywood star, but both of them said that the only way we can achieve this stardom which and maintain it by living a very disciplined life. I don't stay awake after 9 o' clock or whatever.\n\nI go to sleep by that time. This I wake up early. Akshay Kumar had some so and said this has to only be, what do we call it, recorded at six o' clock in the morning. But that's the only time he will be available. He won't be staying late or doing this. And he said, I'm very disciplined.\n\nI do this exercise daily. And I heard exact same thing from John Abraham's interview on somewhere. Now I wouldn't really think that they have a great knowledge of Bhagavad Gita or somebody told them. They themselves figured out that if I want to maintain my success, the only way I can maintain it is by living a disciplined life. So anyone who is is serious about success eventually finds out that success is only possible by living a moderate life of moderation. So Bhagavad Gita says if I'm not clear about that and think that meditation will be panasha, that it will solve all the problems, then I can live as Mina said, I take Lipitor and after that I can eat anything I want because I'm on Lipitor.\n\nThat's not a smart idea, right? Because anytime a doctor gives me medication, I say, Neil, you have A cholesterol problem. Here's the medication. But medication only will work well if you control your diet and do the following things. So anything which I want to achieve, the moderation is the key. Bhagavan says, first of all, it says, yoga is not for the people who live an extreme life, you know?\n\nThen the positive message is Yukta Ahara Vihaarasya, Yukta Chestasya Karmasu, Yukta Sapnava Vodashya Yogo Bhavati Dukhaha. So now it says, well, did I really forget why I'm doing this yoga? Why did I start all this thing in the first place? If I have to do this moderate life and all this fun I used to have at the party at night, I have to give up on all that. Why do I even start getting into something like that? You are doing it, my friend, to get rid of your dukkha.\n\nAll the sorrows which you have, you want to get rid of it. When every moment of your life, there's not a single moment where I can say, this pain is great. Bola really feels good, you know, Unless you heard this. Somebody was banging his head. And I don't know who said it, it's pretty famous. He said someone was banging his head.\n\nWhy are you banging your head against the wall? He said, because it feels good when I stop. Just to get that feeling of good. When you stop, you don't bang your head against the wall. You want to get rid of any pain that you have in your life, physical, mental, intellectual. You want to get rid of as quickly as possible in the easiest way.\n\nBhagavan says, yukta Ahara Viharashya. First of all, the person who is moderate in Ahar, consumption of all these sense objects, you know, Vihara. Vihara meant moving around, going, when we do it, vacation, cruise. But then sometimes more work, isn't it? So that you have to do in moderation too. Recreation also in moderation is good.\n\nI used to watch movies when I was a student because in those days there was the only Entertainment. Sometimes from 12 to 3 and go to the next 3 to 6, 6 to 9 by the time the last show comes.",
      "reflection": "Try even five minutes of stillness today. Don't worry about doing it correctly. Simply sit, close your eyes, and notice what's happening in your field of awareness.\n\nWhen the mind wanders—and it will—gently bring it back. This gentle returning is the practice. Each time you notice wandering and return, you're strengthening the muscle of awareness. The Gita is clear: the mind is restless and difficult to control, but through practice and dispassion, it can be mastered.\n\nConsider: What is your relationship with your own mind? Are you its master, or does it control you? The practice of meditation is the practice of reclaiming sovereignty over your own inner world."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 6, Dhyana Yoga, Yoga of Meditation. And that happiness can only come if we become detached from our attachment to this world of objects and beings. But we still have to work in this world. And therefore the simple definition given of a person who has achieved that detachment, whether you call him a yogi or a sannyasis, Anasritaha Karma, Falam Karyam Karautiya. One who acts in this world without depending on the fruits of actions, he is acting, but he is not dependent on what will come out of my actions. That anxiety is not there.\n\nOne who has achieved that state of mind control. He is a yogi or he is a sannyasi. That's as simple a definition. Then he says to achieve that state, obviously you have to go through several disciplines and practices. And all this is all about controlling your mind. Because all that we consider a happiness or unhappiness, sorrow or pleasure is all a mental state.\n\nThat mental state is controlled. Then we can control whether we are in a happiness or unhappiness state. So the practice given is called meditation. This meditation is not just a physical act of sitting down cross legged and focusing on some idea, but regulating the entire life. So we have seen the prerequisites of what needs to be done. It's a one who is regulating his life in all aspects.\n\nHe does not eat too much, he does not eat too little, he does not sleep too much, he does not sleep too little. And even in the activities that he does not exert himself too much. In other words, everything in moderation. All that really means is you only apply the appropriate amount of efforts and not too much, not too little, you are tightening a bolt. If you tighten too much, it's a problem. If you don't tighten enough, it's too much.\n\nOnly time it works perfectly is when it is appropriately tightened. So every activity of our life should be regulated to a point. But then your mind has to be focused or controlled and how do we control mind? And we have learned that the very nature of the mind, very definition of mind is mind is nothing but a flow of thoughts. Mind is like a river. Water does not make a river, but a flowing water in one direction makes a river.\n\nSo mind is nothing but the flow of thoughts, in our case, many directions. So these thoughts which are right now are channelized into many channels. Those each channel thinks that there is, at the end of the channel, there is happiness. That this channel, if we channelize to one particular point where we think the happiness really lies, Scripture says, lies within yourself. So that exercise of reverting your mind's flow of thoughts from outward to inward is called meditation. To practice that, we have been given a prescription and detailed instruction.\n\nSit down erect so there is no discomfort in your body. There is no discomfort in the environment around you. And then focus your mind onto yourself. That peace which you experience during that inward journey is yourself. And as the meditators of all ages have said, once you experience that peace, you will like to experience that over and over again. And then with that constant practice, you reach a point where that peace become permanent.\n\nSo the last thing we have seen is that. YADAV VINIYATAM CHITTAM TMANIYEVA TISHTATHE when the mind rests in the self, only once the mind found its final destination, where the peace lies, it does not want to go anywhere. If somebody says, where do you want to buy a house in Richmond? And everybody says, where? Once I've decided the West End is the right place to buy a house, I'm not going to look around in Mechanicsville or in a Chesterfield, because I have already decided that right place to find house is in West End. So once the mind decides that the real resting place where the peace is is in myself, it will not go anywhere else.\n\nIt's just the very nature of the mind. So it says, once that mind is rest in self, free from longing. NISPROHA SARVA KAMA E BIHA all the kamas were up till now, were for what? Everything I have done since I understood who I am till last night or this morning is to get happiness, to feel happy, to get peace in life. And this peace is so elusive. More you go after it like a mirage.\n\nMore you go after it, more it runs away from you. And that once you find a place where it is not a mirage, then you will establish in that. So he says, once you establish in that there is no longing of all objects and desire, then it is Said he is united that Yuktah. We are like the lost children. We are lost in this sansar, this mela and we are seeking our own place where our family or where we came from. So that place when we get united we find peace.\n\nA child will be lost in India festival and is crying profusely. No matter what you tell him, give me chocolate. Nothing works till find my parent. And as soon as he finds his parents nothing can attract him but that peace. When you find after that there is nothing else you will look for. So our nature is peace and therefore we are seeking peace.\n\nIf our nature is not peace, we wouldn't be seeking peace. My nature is health, therefore I am seeking health. So anything happens, I run to the doctor, run to whatever, fix me quickly, as quickly as you can. Everybody says antibiotics, read about antibiotics and all the perils of taking antibiotics. The first thing I go and ask my doctor is give me the antibiotics as quickly and as powerful as possible. I want to get rid of whatever that is not health as quickly as possible.\n\nBecause my real nature is health. My real nature is not unhealthy. So I am always seeking what my true nature is. My true nature is peace. And everything else in this world is giving me un peace. Once I unite with that peace, I am considered Yuktaha.\n\nThis simile used is just as in a windless room the flame of a lamp does not flicker, it remains steady. Yatra uparamate chittam nirdam yoga sevaya yatracha eva atmana tmanam pasyan atmani tushyade. So when the mind restrained by the practice of yoga attains quietude by when seeing the self by the self he satisfied by the self always seeking all our life is some satisfaction, some peace. We tried everywhere else but it was never complete. It may come for a for a while as I said. As soon as I get that, the key of my first BMW in my hand, a complete peace in my mind.\n\nAll that I want to achieve. And the next moment the agitation starts again. As soon as he tells me what the insurance would be for this guy. But once I found that piece where? By the self satisfied by the self. So yogi, once he practices this yoga to find his peace and he found it, he is now satisfied that the final state.\n\nSo this four verses which we are looking at basically describe yoga, what yoga is all about. Because we have this whole notion about yoga sitting down in a lotus position. Those are all the practices to control your body, mind and intellect. All agitations are coming to me in my life is through my body, mind and intellect. Either my body is not healthy, my body is very healthy. My mind is not healthy.\n\nMind is okay, but ideas are not coming the intellect. Once those are controlled and the peace comes, then I am a yogi. Sukhum atyantikam Yattat Buddhi Grahiyam Atindriyam Vetti Yatra nachayevayam Titaha chalati tatvatah. This is like somebody who has gone to Hawaii and is explaining the joy of being in Hawaii. He said I had been to all these different destination for vacation. He said, no, no, Neil, forget about all of that.\n\nYou just go to Hawaii one time and that's the end of the story. You wouldn't like to go anywhere else. So he explained and see, when you go there, they have all these things. After that you never have to take a vacation anywhere else. Sukam Atyantikam Yattad When a yogi feels this infinite bliss, one who has experienced this bliss in his meditation, he said that's infinite bliss. That bliss is not something which comes and goes.\n\nSo what we worry about is this too much trouble in the first place. First place I can't wake up early in the morning as everybody says that you should do. Then I have to sit down in a particular place. Then I have to control my mind which is not controllable in the first place. And then I will, someday I will find little peace and then it will go away and then start all over again. The real meditation is once person has experienced that infinite bliss can be grasped by the intellectual Buddhi Graham atendream It's not something which is promised which never can be proved.\n\nSwami used to say in our business there is no danger because we can bluff our way out and nobody can catch us. But no, Bhagavan said that's not true. You will be able to grasp this peace through a Buddhi intellect. But that Buddhi is the pure Buddhi, the intellect that is not clouded by Rajas and Tamas. See, we are also very smart find what is right and wrong for us. But all that right and wrong is colored by my vasanas.\n\nWhat my Buddhist says, this is good for you or what Is not good for you is all colored by my experiences and my desires and my Vasanas. That intellect which is pure will grasp that infinite happiness. Vitti Yatrana Yatra Nacha Eva Ayam Sthitaha Chalati Tattvatah. Once Buddhi grasps that infinite peace he will never be shaken from that ultimate reality. Tattvataha he will never be able to think other way around. He will never be able to think happiness lies outside.\n\nBecause his Buddhi has grasped that the reality where the bliss is so that's a state which only you have to achieve one time. Once you achieve that, nobody will be able to shake you off that realization. Once you realize what is reality. Once you wake up from your dream and you realize what the reality is. No matter how much you convince yourself that no, no, no. The reality was the one which was experiencing the dream.\n\nIn my dream I was Bill Gates boss. No matter how much I convinced myself that no, no, I am actually Bill Gates boss. That's not going to work. Because once my Buddhis grasped that what I was experiencing was nothing but a dream, as a waker I will not be able to go back to that. In the same way the Upanishad says that the waking world is a dream. We have assigned values to all these objects in our waking world which is happiness.\n\nOnce you wake up from this, do you realize that there is no value outside for my own bliss or happiness? In that you cannot be shaken off. Yamlab dvaach aparam labam manyate na adhikam tathaha. Having experienced that, you will realize there is nothing else greater to be achieved. All my life, everything I have done is to find some peace. Some peace, some happiness.\n\nWell, here is ultimate happiness and ultimate bliss. So there is nothing to be gained if I suddenly wake up and realize that my forefathers used to own the entire real estate in Richmond.",

      "commentary": "Unlike a car with its user's manual, we are born without instructions how to live. We experience life vicissitudes without a so called user's manual. The Gita has been described as such a guide. So those of you who remember we were on chapter six two weeks ago and we discuss _Verses_ 25, 26 and 27. Chapter six is a dhyana yoga. The first six chapters, as we have discussed many, many times, describe the you part of that.\n\nYou are that thou art Tattvamasi in the Upanishads. So the you part is you and I, who we are. Today we discussed in first six chapter and it culminates into Dhyana Yoga that who I am, which I can't understand right now, I can reflect on myself and find that self. This false notion is this is me, this body, mind and intellect. To undo this, I have to contemplate on that self. And once I find myself by myself, becomes content in myself, then my yoga is complete.\n\nThat's what we have seen. The verse we have seen which says. Atmanam Pashyam atmani Tushadi. Seeing the self by the Atmana. Atmanam Pashyan Atmani Tushadhi. Seeing the self by the self.\n\nI'm satisfied in myself. That's the goal of life. I want contentment, I want happiness which is everlasting. I looked at, I sought that outside. I finally find in myself. And once I find that in myself, I'm satisfied, content.\n\nSo the first six chapters told us who we are, what are our shortcomings and how to overcome that, culminating into meditation. And we came across a new definition of yoga in last few _Verses_ which says Dukkha sahyoga vayoga is yoga. Disassociation with the association with sorrows is yoga. You've seen that right now we actually associate with our sorrows, therefore we are sorrowful. I have ache and pain in my leg and I think I have pain. So I start associating with this pain, somebody pricks me and that's my pain.\n\nBut when doctor or a nurse is ready to give me an injection, I'm already prepared for that. I disassociate myself from that pain so I can tolerate it without any problem. Because I have already disengaged and said that's not really a pain, not something unnatural happening to me. That attitude of disassociating yourself with the association with pain. Pain exists, sorrows exist and my association with that ends. Bhagavan says that's Yoga Dukkha sah Yoga.\n\nYoga is Yoga and therefore say Dukena Guruna API na Vichalyate then the greatest sorrows come from the outside world. It seems like greatest sorrows are coming to me. From my perspective those sorrows are just the natural occurring of this world. It happens just as the laws of nature predicted will happen. So therefore in Yogi who has disassociated himself from the sorrows, he is without any. He has found himself by himself and he finds this infinite joy and happiness in that.\n\nSo the next three _Verses_ which he had seen says they go along with 24 which is Sankalpa Prabhavan Kaman Tak Manasa Indriyagram Vinam Vinayamya. Samantha, you have traveled that journey from ignorance about yourself to understanding what's not right in my internal instrument, the mind and intellect, purifying it through the Karma Yoga, contemplating on that self, I have come to this point that now I have given up all the desire prompted actions, all the desires which are prompted by Sankalpa Shakti of my mind. In other words, I may have normal desire like I'm thirsty and I want water. That's not Sankalpa Prabhavan Kama. They are not born out of my fanciful imagination. I'm thirsty when I need water.\n\nBut the Sankalpa Shakti in my mind is my mind projects a future, imaginary future and say if I do this then I can do this and then I will have this and then I'll gain this and then I'll be a millionaire. Well that's my Sankalpa Shakti. And what I do is before I start a plan to achieve that goal, my mind has already moved on to another goal. But I can also do this and then do this and then do this and then I can be a billionaire. So before even I start any concrete actions to achieve my goal my mind has erased that goal and gave me another goal. So I'm constantly chasing the goal which is not there.\n\nBy that time I start working on my goal. My goal has moved away. So I'm aimlessly moving. And you see that Sankalpa Shakti. All the desires prompted by this fanciful nature of my mind. When I give up asesata without leaving anything behind.\n\nIn other words, I will leave in the presence of work, in the presence and all my goals which are grounded in my life and I'll work towards that. That's not Gita says you should give up. But it says Sankalpa Prabhuan. All the desires prompted by this fanciful nature of a mind. You give up Manasa Indriyagram Vinayamya and then controlling all these senses. The senses which are my instrument to transact with this world outside.\n\nMy sense of sight, sense of sound, touch, smell, taste that I control by my mind. Because the senses really do not have any power. Till the mind creates tricks, plays tricks with it. So if I control my mind, my mind is now steady because it is inwardly focused on myself. I control all the senses through my mind. So Sanahi then the verse we have seen is Sanahi Sanahi Uparam Buddhaya Dhruti Gruhitaya Atma Sanstam Manaha Krutva Nakinchi da Vicentayat.\n\nHe says this is not going to come overnight. You have to constantly practice that. Then gradually Sanai, gradually you will have a control over this by the firm intellectual intellect which is now purified by all the things which we talked about in the first six chapters. Selfless actions, you know, and all these things. And now purified my intellect which is a pure intellect is seeing the reality. What is right and what is wrong.\n\nWhat is really good for me and what is not good for me. With that intellect I. I gradually get the control and get this peace and say Atma Sanstam Manaha Kratva. Mind is established in the self. It's not running outside to fulfilling these fanciful desires. It established in the self. Kincit Apinachintayat Yogi.\n\nSuch a seeker will not be thinking about anything but the self. In other words, now I clearly see the difference between I and the instruments of my transaction with the world. This body, mind and intellect are just instruments which I use to transact with this world. That duality only exists in my mind. Myself and your self and his self is one and the same self. This duality has created these sorrows for me.\n\nThis Establishment in the self gives me the contentment which I had been seeking for. And now comes the prescription. Because we think that once I have figured out and I'm established in meditation, that everything is over. I have now achieved what I'm going to achieve. And after that there's not really much efforts left for me. So the next verse, Bhagavan reminds us that this is a constant effort to control your mind.\n\nIf you think the mind is going to turn towards yourself and that is the end of the story that is going to remain there, you are mistaken. The very nature of mind is restless. The mind is called mind because it is the flow of thoughts. And a flow of thoughts. Keeping in one direction is going to be difficult. So therefore you need to be vigilant in your intellect and seeing what the mind is doing.\n\nAnd controlam ashiram very nature of the mind is. It is restless, unsteady. You can't think of the one thing for a long period of time. I'm thinking about something and suddenly I hear something and my mind just runs away. I'm thinking about doing something and my mind sees something and it runs away from that. It is the very nature of the mind to use the senses as its gateways and runs away.\n\nAnd I say, don't try to punish yourself for that. But remember that your job is to bring that mind back to where it needs to be. So you have to train this mind and tell this mind this is not right. You're trying to meditate, you're trying to study. You're trying to do something which you decided is good for you. This is what you want to do.\n\nBut hearing something, listening something, seeing something, mind runs away. Don't get discouraged. But bring the mind back and say, you should be doing this right now. So Bhagawan says, yatha yattaha nisharati manaha chanchalam astiram tathaha tathaha niyamya etad atmani evam vasam nayat. Whenever, whenever mind does that. That time you bring the mind and establish back into yourself by yourself.\n\nBring your mind, turn it towards yourself and then say prasantamanasamhinam yoginam sukhamuttamam. Why are we doing all of that? Why do you want to control the mind? Just because I want to punish my mind, say no, no. What you're looking for was happiness, Sukham. You are looking for a happiness which is everlasting.\n\nTherefore it's uttamam, not the regular ones which we get for a While and then it goes away. Well, we had been good. We had been going through this all our life and we are not very happy about it. We want something everlasting. Give me something which I never have to return back to the. I want something permanent happiness.\n\nBhagawan said the only permanent happiness comes from Prasantamanah. By a quiet mind is the only source of joy and happiness. Agitated mind cannot give you any happiness. I may be telling you the greatest news of your life. But if your mind is agitated, you won't listen to me. I may be giving you the greatest gift you can receive.\n\nBut if your mind is agitated, you won't even see it. So it is the mind which decides whether I am happy or not. So what is the quality of the mind which is in happiness? The mind which is quiet gives me happiness. And there is a Prasantamanasam Hienam Yoginam Sukha Muttamam. The yogi who has been striving and seeking the self.\n\nOnce he finds his self established the mind in it, his mind now becomes quiet. This quietness in the mind gives the Sukham Uttamam the greatest happiness. Sensing Upeti Santa Rajasam. You know why he gets the happiness? Shanta Rajasam Rajasa activity. You know this Sattva Rajasantamas the very nature of the mind is to be Rajasa want to run away.\n\nWhen you make this mind quiet out of his habit of running away into say stay quiet. You know it gives the happiness. Brahma Bhutam Akalpasham with this practice of meditation when I purified my mind and intellect. Now I have trained my mind to be steady which is contrary to its own nature of running away. This quiet mind removes all my sin or kalmasam and the Yogi becomes without any sin. And the sin is nothing but the impurities in my internal instruments mind and intellect.\n\nI'm purified by those impurities. I now realize that myself and the supreme self is one and the same self. So I become Brahma Bhutam. I've now identified myself with the eternal self which is all pervading, an almighty and omniscient and omnipotent. Then in my previous case I identified myself with this limited self which is limit in my body. A limit of my mental capacity and my intellectual capacity.\n\nAll my problems are because my identification with this limitedness. Now because I have now identified myself with the supreme. All my problems have dissolved into a permanent peace.",
      "reflection": "Try even five minutes of stillness today. Don't worry about doing it correctly. Simply sit, close your eyes, and notice what's happening in your field of awareness.\n\nWhen the mind wanders—and it will—gently bring it back. This gentle returning is the practice. Each time you notice wandering and return, you're strengthening the muscle of awareness. The Gita is clear: the mind is restless and difficult to control, but through practice and dispassion, it can be mastered.\n\nConsider: What is your relationship with your own mind? Are you its master, or does it control you? The practice of meditation is the practice of reclaiming sovereignty over your own inner world."

      "commentary": "Unlike a car with its user's manual, we are born without instructions how to live. We experience life vicissitudes without a so called user's manual. The Gita has been described as such a guide. So those of you who remember we were on chapter six two weeks ago and we discuss _Verses_ 25, 26 and 27. Chapter six is a dhyana yoga. The first six chapters, as we have discussed many, many times, describe the you part of that.\n\nYou are that thou art Tattvamasi in the Upanishads. So the you part is you and I, who we are. Today we discussed in first six chapter and it culminates into Dhyana Yoga that who I am, which I can't understand right now, I can reflect on myself and find that self. This false notion is this is me, this body, mind and intellect. To undo this, I have to contemplate on that self. And once I find myself by myself, becomes content in myself, then my yoga is complete.\n\nThat's what we have seen. The verse we have seen which says. Atmanam Pashyam atmani Tushadi. Seeing the self by the Atmana. Atmanam Pashyan Atmani Tushadhi. Seeing the self by the self.\n\nI'm satisfied in myself. That's the goal of life. I want contentment, I want happiness which is everlasting. I looked at, I sought that outside. I finally find in myself. And once I find that in myself, I'm satisfied, content.\n\nSo the first six chapters told us who we are, what are our shortcomings and how to overcome that, culminating into meditation. And we came across a new definition of yoga in last few _Verses_ which says Dukkha sahyoga vayoga is yoga. Disassociation with the association with sorrows is yoga. You've seen that right now we actually associate with our sorrows, therefore we are sorrowful. I have ache and pain in my leg and I think I have pain. So I start associating with this pain, somebody pricks me and that's my pain.\n\nBut when doctor or a nurse is ready to give me an injection, I'm already prepared for that. I disassociate myself from that pain so I can tolerate it without any problem. Because I have already disengaged and said that's not really a pain, not something unnatural happening to me. That attitude of disassociating yourself with the association with pain. Pain exists, sorrows exist and my association with that ends. Bhagavan says that's Yoga Dukkha sah Yoga.\n\nYoga is Yoga and therefore say Dukena Guruna API na Vichalyate then the greatest sorrows come from the outside world. It seems like greatest sorrows are coming to me. From my perspective those sorrows are just the natural occurring of this world. It happens just as the laws of nature predicted will happen. So therefore in Yogi who has disassociated himself from the sorrows, he is without any. He has found himself by himself and he finds this infinite joy and happiness in that.\n\nSo the next three _Verses_ which he had seen says they go along with 24 which is Sankalpa Prabhavan Kaman Tak Manasa Indriyagram Vinam Vinayamya. Samantha, you have traveled that journey from ignorance about yourself to understanding what's not right in my internal instrument, the mind and intellect, purifying it through the Karma Yoga, contemplating on that self, I have come to this point that now I have given up all the desire prompted actions, all the desires which are prompted by Sankalpa Shakti of my mind. In other words, I may have normal desire like I'm thirsty and I want water. That's not Sankalpa Prabhavan Kama. They are not born out of my fanciful imagination. I'm thirsty when I need water.\n\nBut the Sankalpa Shakti in my mind is my mind projects a future, imaginary future and say if I do this then I can do this and then I will have this and then I'll gain this and then I'll be a millionaire. Well that's my Sankalpa Shakti. And what I do is before I start a plan to achieve that goal, my mind has already moved on to another goal. But I can also do this and then do this and then do this and then I can be a billionaire. So before even I start any concrete actions to achieve my goal my mind has erased that goal and gave me another goal. So I'm constantly chasing the goal which is not there.\n\nBy that time I start working on my goal. My goal has moved away. So I'm aimlessly moving. And you see that Sankalpa Shakti. All the desires prompted by this fanciful nature of my mind. When I give up asesata without leaving anything behind.\n\nIn other words, I will leave in the presence of work, in the presence and all my goals which are grounded in my life and I'll work towards that. That's not Gita says you should give up. But it says Sankalpa Prabhuan. All the desires prompted by this fanciful nature of a mind. You give up Manasa Indriyagram Vinayamya and then controlling all these senses. The senses which are my instrument to transact with this world outside.\n\nMy sense of sight, sense of sound, touch, smell, taste that I control by my mind. Because the senses really do not have any power. Till the mind creates tricks, plays tricks with it. So if I control my mind, my mind is now steady because it is inwardly focused on myself. I control all the senses through my mind. So Sanahi then the verse we have seen is Sanahi Sanahi Uparam Buddhaya Dhruti Gruhitaya Atma Sanstam Manaha Krutva Nakinchi da Vicentayat.\n\nHe says this is not going to come overnight. You have to constantly practice that. Then gradually Sanai, gradually you will have a control over this by the firm intellectual intellect which is now purified by all the things which we talked about in the first six chapters. Selfless actions, you know, and all these things. And now purified my intellect which is a pure intellect is seeing the reality. What is right and what is wrong.\n\nWhat is really good for me and what is not good for me. With that intellect I. I gradually get the control and get this peace and say Atma Sanstam Manaha Kratva. Mind is established in the self. It's not running outside to fulfilling these fanciful desires. It established in the self. Kincit Apinachintayat Yogi.\n\nSuch a seeker will not be thinking about anything but the self. In other words, now I clearly see the difference between I and the instruments of my transaction with the world. This body, mind and intellect are just instruments which I use to transact with this world. That duality only exists in my mind. Myself and your self and his self is one and the same self. This duality has created these sorrows for me.\n\nThis Establishment in the self gives me the contentment which I had been seeking for. And now comes the prescription. Because we think that once I have figured out and I'm established in meditation, that everything is over. I have now achieved what I'm going to achieve. And after that there's not really much efforts left for me. So the next verse, Bhagavan reminds us that this is a constant effort to control your mind.\n\nIf you think the mind is going to turn towards yourself and that is the end of the story that is going to remain there, you are mistaken. The very nature of mind is restless. The mind is called mind because it is the flow of thoughts. And a flow of thoughts. Keeping in one direction is going to be difficult. So therefore you need to be vigilant in your intellect and seeing what the mind is doing.\n\nAnd controlam ashiram very nature of the mind is. It is restless, unsteady. You can't think of the one thing for a long period of time. I'm thinking about something and suddenly I hear something and my mind just runs away. I'm thinking about doing something and my mind sees something and it runs away from that. It is the very nature of the mind to use the senses as its gateways and runs away.\n\nAnd I say, don't try to punish yourself for that. But remember that your job is to bring that mind back to where it needs to be. So you have to train this mind and tell this mind this is not right. You're trying to meditate, you're trying to study. You're trying to do something which you decided is good for you. This is what you want to do.\n\nBut hearing something, listening something, seeing something, mind runs away. Don't get discouraged. But bring the mind back and say, you should be doing this right now. So Bhagawan says, yatha yattaha nisharati manaha chanchalam astiram tathaha tathaha niyamya etad atmani evam vasam nayat. Whenever, whenever mind does that. That time you bring the mind and establish back into yourself by yourself.\n\nBring your mind, turn it towards yourself and then say prasantamanasamhinam yoginam sukhamuttamam. Why are we doing all of that? Why do you want to control the mind? Just because I want to punish my mind, say no, no. What you're looking for was happiness, Sukham. You are looking for a happiness which is everlasting.\n\nTherefore it's uttamam, not the regular ones which we get for a While and then it goes away. Well, we had been good. We had been going through this all our life and we are not very happy about it. We want something everlasting. Give me something which I never have to return back to the. I want something permanent happiness.\n\nBhagawan said the only permanent happiness comes from Prasantamanah. By a quiet mind is the only source of joy and happiness. Agitated mind cannot give you any happiness. I may be telling you the greatest news of your life. But if your mind is agitated, you won't listen to me. I may be giving you the greatest gift you can receive.\n\nBut if your mind is agitated, you won't even see it. So it is the mind which decides whether I am happy or not. So what is the quality of the mind which is in happiness? The mind which is quiet gives me happiness. And there is a Prasantamanasam Hienam Yoginam Sukha Muttamam. The yogi who has been striving and seeking the self.\n\nOnce he finds his self established the mind in it, his mind now becomes quiet. This quietness in the mind gives the Sukham Uttamam the greatest happiness. Sensing Upeti Santa Rajasam. You know why he gets the happiness? Shanta Rajasam Rajasa activity. You know this Sattva Rajasantamas the very nature of the mind is to be Rajasa want to run away.\n\nWhen you make this mind quiet out of his habit of running away into say stay quiet. You know it gives the happiness. Brahma Bhutam Akalpasham with this practice of meditation when I purified my mind and intellect. Now I have trained my mind to be steady which is contrary to its own nature of running away. This quiet mind removes all my sin or kalmasam and the Yogi becomes without any sin. And the sin is nothing but the impurities in my internal instruments mind and intellect.\n\nI'm purified by those impurities. I now realize that myself and the supreme self is one and the same self. So I become Brahma Bhutam. I've now identified myself with the eternal self which is all pervading, an almighty and omniscient and omnipotent. Then in my previous case I identified myself with this limited self which is limit in my body. A limit of my mental capacity and my intellectual capacity.\n\nAll my problems are because my identification with this limitedness. Now because I have now identified myself with the supreme. All my problems have dissolved into a permanent peace.",

      "commentary": "Unlike a car with its user's manual, we are born without instructions how to live. We experience life vicissitudes without a so called user's manual. The Gita has been described as such a guide. We had been discussing chapter six, Yoga of Meditation. So far we have seen up to verse 27 that the goal of meditation is to make the mind steady. The mind currently in my present situation is flickering and running away in many, many directions.\n\nAnd therefore the whole idea of making the mind steady seems very, very difficult for me. So we have seen the practice how to meditate, how to make this mind steady, Choose a place which is conducive, make it a practice every day, make this as a habit, same place, same position, controlling your body from not disturbing you, make it most comfortable, sit down and focus your mind. Now this is where we find ourselves in difficulty focusing the mind on one goal and one target. We have heard this simile that the mind, when it is like a mind, like a lamp, when there is a wind in the room or in the place where the lamp is placed, the flame flickers. And depending on the nature of the wind, flame may flicker very heavily or may flicker just a little, depending on how much wind there is. The mind works in a similar way.\n\nDepending on my vasanas, depending on the desires in my mind, this mind will be running after many, many thoughts and one thought will lead to the another. Swamiji used to say, I'm trying to chant Rama and the Rama. The word Rama reminds me of Ramlal who has borrowed money from me. And then we go on and on and on. But this obviously can be controlled, as we have seen that if you calm down this wind of desires, at least at the time of sitting in the meditation, that you have trained your mind not to think about other things and you focus on that one thought, then mind will be steady. And as we have seen that by a constant practice, the yogi can make his mind steady.\n\nAnd once that mind becomes steady, he will Recognize the peace within himself from whatever the cause. The restless and the unsteady mind wanders away from that. Let him restrain it and bring it back under the control of the self alone by practice now it is becoming easier for me. I guess I am speaking for every seeker who is practicing that practice makes man perfect. We have heard this before. We have learned in our life that anything I continue to practice, it becomes easier.\n\nSomething which I practice over and over and over again. It reaches a point that there is no effort required. Something like driving a car. When I was first learning how to drive a car, obviously I had all kinds of problems. And I may have said this before that I used to complain to my cousins who were trying to teach me how to drive a car in Africa. I had gone from India.\n\nI had never driven a car in India. I probably took some lessons in India before I was living for Zambia. And in India it was very easy to get a license. Nobody even bothered with it. I really knew how to drive, but I got a license now I went to Zambia. And then I really had to drive.\n\nSo learning from my cousins how to drive, and they will tell me, well, keep your car steady, keep your car steady. And I said, how can I keep it steady when I'm sitting on one side of the car? If the steering wheel was in the center of the car, it would have been much easier for me. But that was an excuse because I did not know how to control the car. And then more and more I practice driving the car. It started becoming easier and easier.\n\nAnd then I reached a point where driving a car requires no efforts. I sit down in the car, put the key in the ignition, can be thinking about every other thing except driving the car. But I will be driving properly in a right lane. And whatever the appropriate thing I have to do for driving the car. But I do not have to put any more efforts in. Comes automatically and naturally.\n\nAs soon as I sit down in the driver's seat, my mind takes over. My subconscious mind takes over how to drive this car. Meditation is like that. If I practice over and over and over again to steady my mind under one thought and one thought alone. As soon as I sit at the seat of meditation, my mind will know what to do and it will control itself automatically. And Bhagavan says that such a yogi experiences the supreme bliss, that peace which I had been seeking all my life.\n\nAnd I had been trying to achieve that in many different ways. To acquire things, to make sure everything is secured, my future is secured, my Family's future is secured. However, I never experience that peace in my mind. Now at the seat of meditation, I can experience the supreme bliss. Bhagavan said, the supreme bliss verily comes to this yogi whose mind is quiet and peaceful. His passions are quietened.\n\nNow he is free from sin. And we have seen the sin is nothing but impurities on my mind. Impurities are the impressions on my mind which makes me think that this I will do and that will make me happy. Once my mind is steady and is focused on one thought, who I am, what is myself, all these impurities are purified and I achieve that bliss. And the term used is Brahma Bhutam akalmasham. He becomes one with the Brahman all pervading self and he becomes free of all sins.\n\nContinuing in this thought, the next three verses talks about the yogi who has with continued practice has made this as his own nature that the Yunjan Evam Sada Atmanam Yogi Vigada kalmashah. Again we are talking about in Yogi who has become freed from all his sins. Now we sometimes makes an argument that on one hand, the law of karma says that if I have done something, I have to pay for it. Or if I pay for it, in a sense, if it was a negative act, if it is a positive act, I will get the reward. And then here it says that by meditation I will become free of all sins. How do we reconcile the idea of the law of karma which says you cannot escape from your actions?\n\nHere it says just by plain meditation I can become free from all my sins. Well, the law of karma simply says that my actions will have equal and appropriate reactions. If I've done something inappropriate, I will have to pay the consequences. However, the sins are not the consequences of the actions. Sins are the impressions on my mind. A negative impression on my mind of any event or an experience is a sin.\n\nThese negative impressions are the ones which are causing me to do more wrong things. I have seen somebody making money by illegal means. That impressions, that thought or the observation leaves a wrong impression that if I have to make money, it seemed like this is the only way to do it. That negative impression is a sin. Now that sin will make me act in an inappropriate manner. Then I will also try to achieve the wealth by what I thought was the only way you can achieve wealth by inappropriate means.\n\nThe wrong impression on the mind made me do the wrong things. Now I have to face the consequences of the wrong things I'm doing. However, if I have cleaned up my mind from all these impressions then I'm free of sins. I may have to face the consequences of my actions. There are no more wrong actions will be generated from the impressions on my mind. A Yogi constantly controlling his mind reaches the level of purification that there are no negative impressions.\n\nAnd therefore there is no question for him to react inappropriately. So Yunjan Evam Sada Atmanam Yogi Vikatha Kalma Sahar. The Yogi always engaging the mind. Thus in the practice of yoga, freed from sins, he now Sukena Brahmasp Samsparsam Atyantam Sukham Ashnate. He now easily enjoy that infinite bliss. Because his mind, no matter whatever is happening in his life, in his situations, he is constantly in the thought of that supreme Brahman that he is enjoying that bliss at every moment.\n\nSo he has become Brahma sans person. He is in touch with Brahman in all situation and therefore he is experiencing that bliss in all situation. Sukham Atyantam Ashnute and he enjoys this Sukham, this happiness which is infinite. I have tried in my life all other things, but I never got it. Scripture says that Yogi who meditates and makes his mind steady. Just by that simple act of making the mind steady, he will be in touch with the Brahman.\n\nThe supreme reality will be freed from all his limitations. So the Yogi has now experienced the supreme bliss. So what would be his vision? His vision is Sarva Bhutastam Atmanam, Sarva Bhutani Cha Atmani Ikshate Yoga Yuktatma Sarvatra Samadarshanah. When now his mind harmonized and becoming in touch with the supreme reality, he starts seeing that same reality residing in all beings and also seeing all being, deciding in that supreme reality. We had seen this paradox before in Bhagavad Gita is the Bhagavan is within me or I am in the Bhagavan Is the God is within me the limited being or I the limited being in the God self which is unlimited?\n\nThe both are correct. It depends on your viewpoint. Is the room space in the universal space or is this universal space is in the room? Depending on your perspective, when you see the room space as an individual space, it is nothing but the part of the universal space. But when you see that space in the room as part of the universal space, that universal space is in the room I the limited being in the self of the Bhagavan who is manifesting everywhere and pervading everywhere. But when I look at it from my limited perspective that I see, I the limited being, have the presence of Bhagavan in me.\n\nSo I start seeing that he is in all the beings. I also see that all the beings are in that supreme self. Icsate Yoga Yukta Tatma. Thus the Yogi who is one with the yoga, one, the Yogi who has become one with his Self, he sees this Sarvatra Samadarshanaha everywhere He sees that unity. He sees this presence of the Lord equally in all beings and things. Same Lord which resides in Me is also residing in everything else that manifests in this world.\n\nSuch a vision makes this Yogi becoming one with this world and act as if this world is nothing but its own extension. Yomam pashyati Sarvatra Sarvam chamay Pashyati Tasya aham Napranashyami Sachamena Pranashyati Bhagavan now says Yomam pascati sarvatra. When Lord Krishna in Bhagavad Gita refers to himself as the first person singular, Swamiji points out every time that he is not speaking as Devaki's son or Yasuda's son, but he is referring to himself as the supreme being pervading everyone. That thus the Yogi who sees me everywhere, Yomaam Pashati Sarvatra Anything I see right away, I recognize that is nothing but the Bhagavan's manifestation. Sarvamchamay Pashati I I also see the God's presence in everything. Nothing could have been possible without his presence.",

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter six, Dhyana Yoga, Yoga of Meditation. In chapter two, Sankhya Yoga, we learned how to differentiate between the self and non self. Self is that which is Ajaha, which is unborn and imperishable. Nayanam Chindanti Sastrani Nayanam Dhati Pavaka. That which cannot be destroyed by anything, by weapons or fire or water or air. That's the definition of the self.\n\nAnything which does not fit into the definition is non self. So everything which I consider myself today does not fit into that definition. I was born, I have a birth date and I may have a death date. And everything which I know about me and my possessions fall into the same category. So it all falls into non self. So my world is populated by non self only.\n\nAll that I consider myself so far as me is also non self. My body has a birth and death. My mind has beginning and end. My intellect has beginning and end. So everything that I associate myself and considered to be me is non self. So now the search for the self.\n\nHow do I find myself? So we have learned up to chapter five how to purify the mind and intellect. In other words, how to prepare yourself for this search for running a marathon. You first have to prepare for it the whole period of training. So the second chapter onward we had this clear instruction how to prepare your mind. So once that mind is prepared, which we call Yoga Rudha, one who is now prepared to take on this journey for the search of the self.\n\nSo chapter six we started that journey. How to find the journey once the mind is prepared. When it becomes sinless, that the word we constantly keep using in every language that you wash your sins. In other words, the mind is cleared of all the impurities. We learn the mind is nothing but the thought channels. A thought occurs, second thought follows that same thought.\n\nThird thought now follows the second thought. It is now creating a channel. Those channels are created which has become my mind and it is all going outwards. I'm thinking about something other than me now the same Mind I have to turn towards me the self. So everything I have learned so far is about non self. All my education, all my contemplation on what is good and what is bad, all that is about non self.\n\nSo now I have to turn towards myself the self. That's chapter six Dhyana Yoga Yoga of Meditation. So the how to prepare yourself and position yourself so that you can start that inward journey. So we have seen the clear instruction that once you have prepared your mind and purified your mind of all the scenes, then you start this journey of Dhyana Yoga and constantly doing that search you will come to a point where you will find that bliss. So verse 28 onward we are saying it says the Yogi always engaging in the mind. Thus Yunjan evam sada atmanam Yogi vigatha Kalmasah One who is freed of all sins.\n\nIn other words all the impurities of the mind. Mind which has tendency to see wrong things or going in a wrong direction that I have now adjusted the mind focuses on the right thing, clearly sees this is non self and searching for the Self that Sukena Brahma sans Parsam. Very easily it enjoys the contact with the Brahman. He easily can understand what the Self is. So clear goal here is to do inward search about what is the self is all about. When do I consider that my search has yield some results?\n\nThe next one is Sarva Bhuta Stamatmanam Sarva Bhutani Chaatmani. When I start seeing that self which I'm searching as the real self, not the non self is not only residing in me, but residing in all beings searching for myself. In tone I found the eternal self which is residing all beings and Sarva Bhutani Ch' Aatmani and I see the all beings are in the Self. My standard example, all the houses, all the buildings, I see the space. But then I also see that all the buildings are in the space because the space is all pervading. I was searching for the space for my own room once I realized the nature of the self.\n\nI realized that space is the same in all the buildings in the world. And all the buildings are nothing but in that all pervading self. Once that awareness takes place, then I realize I am now truly understand what the nature of the space is. Space is not something which I create as an architect, not something I can buy from Lowe's or Home Depot. I can only buy material to condition my space. Space is universal and all pervading.\n\nOnce that understanding takes place about the self Bhagavan said he will say sarvatra samadharsanaha. Now he can see the equality everywhere. Now he sees the connectivity everywhere. Yomam pashyati sarvatra sarvam chamay pashati tasya ahamna pranasyami sachamena pranashati. So here comes basically an assurance. Is it something that one time I understand in meditation that I have suddenly and then next day I go to work and I forget all about it?\n\nOnce you have that understanding of all pervading self, that connection with yourself will never get broken, will never be separated. Once I understood the nature of the space, the space is all pervading. These are all conditioning. The buildings we create, the things which are in the space, then my understanding of the space will never go away, no matter what I'm doing. Yomam pashyati sarvatya. The one who sees me everywhere, Sarvamchyamay pashyati.\n\nAll the being, all the things, he sees me in it. Now, as Swamiji says, every time Krishna uses the word me, it's referring to this supreme self. Then my big I is what I'm referring to. The conditioned I is the small I, as we call it. And the big I is the unconditioned I. So when Krishna says me, he's referring to the unconditioned I, which is all perverting.\n\nYoma M. Pasade sir, one who sees me in all things and all things in me. Because now there is no differentiation between the self and the non self. Even the non self was nothing but the part of this. If something is all pervading, there is no space left for anything else to exist. It's only I'm limited. There is a space for other people.\n\nIf I buy all the real estate in Richmond, can you buy anything else? No, there's no nothing left for you to buy. It's only when I leave out a parcel and say I don't want that, then you can come and buy. That when I have recognized myself is all pervading, there is nothing left for anything else to exist. But now I have a vision now of the equality in this plurality. So yomam pasyati sarvatra sarvam chamayi pasyati tasya ahamna pranayami.\n\nFor him I never get separated. Once that vision takes place, you are never separated from it. Once I wake up from my dream, I never get separated from the waker. Both dreamer and waker are now connected to the waker. Dreamer also remembers that I am the waker I was dreamer, now I am a waker. Same dreamer is now waker.\n\nThe waker knows I am the waker who is dreaming. Now waking up, I never go back to the dreaming state. So once I established in my waking state, I never get separated from that till I go to sleep again. So basically once that understanding takes place, then myself is nothing but all pervading self. I never get separated from myself. There is such a Meena Pranashati and now the assurance from the all pervading Lord and I will never get separated from him.\n\nThat relationship is dual relationship. I have relationship with him and he has relationship with me. It is not a one sided love. I liked her, but she never know that I exist. Then I say, well I will never leave you. But she said, I don't even know that you exist.\n\nI, the conditioned self has now recognized that I'm nothing but the manifestation of the me of the supreme self. The supreme self knows that I am not conditioned in this body mind. So this relationship is mutual relationship. Both exist in their own perspective. The supreme self exists from a perspective of the macrocosm. And my conditioned self exists in a perspective of the microcosm.\n\nThe room space exists as a. We can be meeting here on Sunday morning. If I say room space does not exist, only universal space exists. Go and meet in a Louis Ginter garden same as meeting here. No, we have to come here. This is where we meet.\n\nIt does exist, but nothing but the manifestation of this supreme space. So same way my conditioned self exists as an ego which is identifying with this conditioning. But it clearly knows that this is purely an identification with this conditioning for the convenience as an equipment of transaction with other conditioning selves. So the next verse says Sarva Bhuta sthitam yomam bhajati e kattum asthitah. Once we've established in this unity, now that I have seen what is myself, my search was for if this is my non self, this body is my non self. Mind is my non self, intellect is my non self.\n\nI found myself that that consciousness which is not conditioned by this body, mind and intellect is myself. That's why in meditation the whole goal is to not to be aware about your body, not to be aware about your thoughts, about everything else, not to be aware about your intellect. Because intellect can become a hindrance in understanding. More I consider that I'm pretty smart. More I do dumb things. More I give up my idea about My intellectual.\n\nI learn more and more about myself. So Bhagavan said, the one Ekatvamasti, the one who is now established in the unity of all things. I have realized that my conditioning, your conditioning is very different. You are not me and I am not you. You have your own limitations, I have mine. But the essence which makes me who I am, in essence between who you are is the one and the same.\n\nThe self in you and self in I is one and the same. That unity I have found. We constantly search commonness. We come across a new person. We don't try to find how different we are from each other. First thing we try to find what is common among us.\n\nI say, I am from Richmond. Oh, I am also from Richmond. Okay, we have one commonness we found. Then we gradually say, okay. Where do you come from? Well, I come from Surat.\n\nOh, I'm also from Surat. More we find commonness, more we feel comfort. Then we are not worried as much about the differences which we have. The differences drop more common things. We find the people whom we love, all the negative things about them. We don't pay attention to our children, our grandchildren.\n\nThey are mischievous, laugh it off. We feel good about it. We say, how cute it is. Somebody else do that to you. Because we found something common. So the first search for every human being or every being is to find commonness among ourselves.\n\nOnce we find more things common, more identification occurs. First in the college I saw her. Then I found out she takes the same chemistry class I do common. Then I found out she comes from the same town I come from. More things I found common, more I identify with her.",
      "reflection": "Try even five minutes of stillness today. Don't worry about doing it correctly. Simply sit, close your eyes, and notice what's happening in your field of awareness.\n\nWhen the mind wanders—and it will—gently bring it back. This gentle returning is the practice. Each time you notice wandering and return, you're strengthening the muscle of awareness. The Gita is clear: the mind is restless and difficult to control, but through practice and dispassion, it can be mastered.\n\nConsider: What is your relationship with your own mind? Are you its master, or does it control you? The practice of meditation is the practice of reclaiming sovereignty over your own inner world."

      "commentary": "We have been discussing Chapter 6, Dhyana Yoga, Yoga of Meditation and Contemplation. So far we have seen in chapter 6 that Bhagavan has emphasized on quiet mind. The basis of all the practices is mind. And as long as you can control the mind, you can become a yogi. Bhagavan had said Samatvam Yoga Uchade Equanimity is yoga. In this chapter he also says Dukkha Sah Yoga of yoga is Yoga.\n\nThe detachment from the attachment to pain is Yoga. We have a natural attachment to pain. Our mind goes towards pain more than it goes towards other things. The other way to look at it is detachment from all the objects which has potential to give me pain if I can detach myself from all the potential dangers. This is what we try to do in our life, is to avoid all the dangers, try to protect ourselves from any potential danger that we see in our life. But once, if you can detach yourself from all the potential dangers, which actually includes all sense objects in this world, all sense objects have equal capacity to give me pleasure as it capacity to give me pain.\n\nSo therefore, if I really want to detach myself from all pains, all potential dangers of getting pain, I have to avoid all sense objects. So in verse 27, Bhagawan has concluded his teachings. Prasantamanasamhi enam yoginam Sukha Muthamam. That supreme bliss which I am seeking all my life. I am looking for permanent happiness. I don't want temporary happiness, I want permanent happiness.\n\nBhagawan saying that happiness is available to a yogi who has achieved this supremely quiet mind. Upeti Santarajasam Brahmabhutam or Kalmasam. Supreme bliss comes to this yogi whose mind is peaceful, whose patience are quietened and he does not have any rajas in Brahma Bhutam or Kalmasam. He has become sinless. There is no impurity on his mind. It has become Brahman Brahma Bhutam.\n\nHe recognizes that my own self, the ego, is none other than The Brahman. This synchronization of my ego with Brahman is the ultimate goal to achieve that final state of supreme happiness, permanent bliss. But the basis of all that is prasantamana. It all boils down to whether I can have this mind completely quiet, completely under control. And then verse 28:32, Bhagawan has described the Yogi who has achieved this state of becoming Brahman. He sees that self in all beings and all beings in the self.\n\nHe will have both perspective at the same time that he sees that consciousness in me. But I'm also in the consciousness. Pot space is within the spot, but pot is in the space also. That dual perspective, if I can have simultaneously, I can synchronize these two perspectives. Bhagavan said that comes only when the Yogi has achieved this Siddhi of quietening the mind and becoming Brahman. He sees sameness everywhere.\n\nHe never gets separated from the self, the self never gets separated from him. Once the pot space realizes that the space outside me is no different, then the space within me never gets separated from the main space. When my ego recognizes that myself, the consciousness in me, is none other than the consciousness everywhere. So right now we cannot imagine that consciousness can be anything outside living beings. But Bhagavad Gita time and again tells us that consciousness is all pervading. We are all existing within the consciousness.\n\nThis world is created out of that supreme self. There is no other material was available to create this universe other than the self alone. And because that yogi has achieved this state, he sees sameness of the self in all beings. Now he has achieved a different reason. Our vision right now is to live in this world by identifying the differences. So the way we transact in this world is if I can detect differences, then I can differentiate things one from another.\n\nTable is not chair, chair is not table. Because they will both look completely different from each other. Different characteristics. But I can also see probably the sameness if both are made up of wood. That sameness when a person sees, Swamiji very cleverly puts it in the biblical term of that that person. Now because this is the sameness, he loves others as he loves his own self.\n\nI don't see any difference between doing something for me or doing something for others. It's basically one and the same thing. Now I also won't do anything to others which I don't want others to do to me because of the sameness that I detect in all things and beings. Up till now I was seeing only differences and that's how I lived my life. By detecting differences and protecting myself from what I don't find conducive and then engaging myself in what I find conducive. But now I don't say anything conducive or unconducive.\n\nBut sameness is my central vision. And Arjuna has been very quietly listening to this and he has come to the conclusion that the basis of all this is Prasantamanah supremely peaceful mind. And therefore he actually verbalize doubt we have in our mind while learning Bhagavad Gita whether it is at all possible. Arjunava Yoyam Yoga TV this yoga that you just described which can be achieved only by quiet mind. Samyana Madhusudana of the sameness that you have described. The the yoga which you described which requires that I see sameness in everything and every being.\n\nWe discussed the importance of the words used in our scriptures. All the names used for Krishna or Arjuna are strategically placed as a Madhu Sudhana one with the slayer of demon Madhu in this life we get attracted to things which are sweet for us. Something which is nice, comfortable, we are attracted to them. Attraction in the end creates all my sorrows. I don't get attracted to them in the first place. I won't have the problems which they are capable of giving me.\n\nKa in Madhusudyana he is the remover. He is the destroyer of this attraction to comfortable pleasant things. I don't see that happening. My mind always goes to finer things in life. I find Marriott is better than Hilton to stay at Marriott, not at Super 8. This is the nature of my mind.\n\nMy mind always gravitates towards finer things and avoids painful uncomfortable situation. I don't think that's going to change. Because the very nature of mind is ever changing. Mind is constantly flowing in various directions. Whatever the sense organs report to it. I was only experiencing seven eleven's coffee.\n\nMy mind is always looking for seven eleven's coffee. I remember when he used to practice Bhajans in our youth group. We used to invite a violin player. As soon as he comes we have to send somebody to get his coffee from 7 11. We couldn't offer him coffee at home. Oh yeah, Subhas is here.\n\nGo and get his coffee from 7 11. Because for him 7 limits coffee was ultimate. He said mana is chanchara as long as it is not experienced. The other thing, he may stick to this but as soon as it finds Other things better than this, it's gonna move on to the next thing and then the next thing. Chanchalatva Sthitim Sthiram Therefore I do not see this as long lasting situation. Even if I practice everything that you taught me in this chapter about meditation.\n\nFind a quiet place, sit down comfortably and focus on one point. Then once I focus on one point, if your mind runs away, bring it back. I may do it for 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes. But what is after that? After that my mind is going to do exactly what it was doing before I sat down from meditation. So therefore, O Krishna, this is wonderful discourse.\n\nBut I don't think this is possible to achieve that permanent steadiness Prasantha Manasam which you have described in verse 27. So very bold question and very daring question because he completely told Krishna that this is not practical. It sounds very good, it has good aesthetics, it's very, very pleasant to hear. But I don't see its application in my life. Because my life I know how my mind works. And it's not going to be staying at one place as you require my mind to do.\n\nI think every one of us without an exception feels exactly same. I practice meditation. How many minutes he count in minutes Meditation? Bhagawan said it has to be a permanent situation. Your mind should be steady all the time. Chanchalamhi Manakrishna, Pramathi, Balbadrudam he said, I'm not giving you this argument just to make an argument.\n\nBut I know the nature of mind, my mind at least. Chanchalamhi Manah, Krishna, Brahmati, Balabhadram this mind is Chanchal always going in different directions. Brahmati it's very turbulent. Balava Drudam very strong and firm. Once my mind gets attached to an object, it's very difficult to remove him. If I start thinking about drinking coffee, I won't be able to concentrate on what I'm doing till I get cup of coffee.\n\nBecause the mind is very strong. I have to get up and get a cup of coffee. You know, I can focus on whatever I was doing before. Then I put the coffee in that warmer I keep on my desk. Then I'll forget about it. After an hour I realized that I got up, went and got a cup of coffee.\n\nCoffee was not really needed because I didn't even remember to drink. But at that time the mind was so attached to the coffee I had to go and get a cup of coffee. Swamiji explains here the word Krishna comes from the root Krish. Krish means to Uproot Krishna is the one who uproots all these attachments from my mind is Krishna. So therefore Bhagavan Bedvi was very strategically put. This person Arjuna has not addressed Krishna as Krishna commonly.\n\nChanchalamhi Manakrishna this mind is not only all over the place and going everywhere but it's very turbulent, very difficult to control. And Dhrudam, when it gets attached to something, it's very difficult to disengage it from that object. Vayoho iva DSU Duskaram not only Duskaram not difficult, very difficult. Sudhuskaram I consider control of this mind as difficult as wind. And right now we have this prediction of hurricane hitting Upper east coast. All you can do is get out of its way.\n\nThere is nothing you can say will prevent the hurricane from hitting New York or Long island. Divert it towards the sea. None of that is in our power even though we are super power. Only thing you can do is get out of its way. So this mind is as difficult to control as wind. And therefore, O Krishna, I don't think it is possible.\n\nEven if I control my mind temporarily, permanently it is not possible. Therefore this yoga is not a practical yoga. And Bhagavan then answers this question. We can learn a technique of how to win an argument. If we are debating or arguing or negotiating and somebody makes a point and if you rightly will reject it, that person will become even firmer in his opinion. I don't believe that he will become a firm and say, well I don't.\n\nI don't agree with you and that will continue. Nobody will win the argument. So Bhagawan, first he agrees with Arjuna. He said you are right. So first thing you do is agree with your opponent. No doubt you are not wrong, Arjuna.\n\nYou are not making argument just for the sake of making an argument. But your argument is very, very valid. That mind is difficult to control. This is a very commonly known fact. Mind is not easy to control.",
      "reflection": "Try even five minutes of stillness today. Don't worry about doing it correctly.

      "commentary": " Shri Purohit Swami did not comment on this sloka\n\n 6.39 My Lord! Thou art worthy to solve this doubt once and for all; save Thyself there is no one competent to do so.\n\nSo we had been discussing Chapter 6, Dhyana Yoga, Yoga of Meditation. And obviously this is the conclusion of all the discussion we had about ourselves, who we are, what we consider ourselves to be, what we should be considering ourselves to be and how to get there. Right now I'm identified with this limited being called me, my body, mind and intellect. Chapter two said, your goal is to identify with the one which is imperishable. Then we have talked about how to do this through Karma Yoga by doing greater good selfless activities to purify your mind and intellectual so that it starts seeing the reality as is without coloring it through your vasanas and desires and aspirations and goals. And then when I go through that process, we had been told how to now train your mind to not go outside.\n\nSo wherever our mind goes, that's where our attachment goes. That's where identification is. My mind goes to my leg. And therefore my identification is more stronger with the body at the time. Nothing, no great ideas are important that time. Look, my leg is hurting.\n\nLet me tell you about theory of evolution. So wherever a mind goes, that's where my identification is. Mind has now tendency to go out in this world and attach do many things create new attachments every day. So we learned that the goal is now to withdraw the mind, make it inward towards yourself and attach it to yourself. When we get to that point, what will be our experience and we have Learned in verse 29 says Sarva Bhutastam Atmanam Sarva Bhutani Chaatma. Right now I think this is me.\n\nI am in the center of my world. You are in the center of your world. She is in the center of her world. He is in the center of his world. And whenever world collides, that's our relationship. Sometimes they overlaps in a pleasant way and we have friendly encounter.\n\nSometimes they collide very violently and we have conflicts. When my goal and your goal is to achieve the same object, then we are on a collision course as we see in the debates last night, in the very first debate when there are 15 candidates, Donald Trump said, Ted Cruz is a good guy. He is not capable, but he is my friend. Gradually yesterday, he is a liar. He is a liar, nothing but a liar. They are both going toward the same object and they are on a collision course.\n\nSo our worlds are separate and they come and collide with each other in various ways because we all have different worlds. But once the mind is turned towards inward, Bhagavan said, you will find that the self which you call yourself is not only just yourself, but the same self in all the beings. There are not too many different selves, the one self expressing through all the beings. So therefore, Sarva Bhutastam Atmanam I see that this same self is residing in all the beings. What I consider my consciousness is the same consciousness for you and him and she and her. In Sarva Bhutani Ch'.\n\nAatmani not only that, I will also see that the self is not in the beings. Actually, the beings are in the self. Our standard analogy, the this space is in this room. The next door room has its own space. So this room space and that room space have some relationship. They belong to the same building.\n\nSo they are basically related to each other more friendly way. So this space and that space, how did I create them? By putting a partition between in the space, the one space. I put a partition created two space. Now did I really divide the space or I put a partition in the space? I actually put the partition in the space space remaining what it is, I just put a partition in.\n\nSo now is it the space within the partitions or the partitions are within the space? Those of you who have been attending Gita class for a long time know that the partition is in the space. This room used to be much larger partition. The same way, when I start visualizing that all these buildings in this world are actually in the space, not that the space is in the building. So when I turn my gaze towards myself, not only I find that my self is something other than this body, mind and intellect, but the same self is expressing through all the body. All the beings and all the beings are nothing but in the space.\n\nBecause the self is all pervading, just as the space is all pervading. So no matter what building I create in, no matter where on this planet or in another universe, it's still the same space. Iksate Yoga Yukta Tma, Sarvatraha Samadharsanaha One who has become the Yoga Yukta. One who has mastered the yoga. Yoga is to connect one who has mastered that connection of removing this identification from this outside world to inside. Sarvatra Samadarsana.\n\nHe becomes equanimous in all his vision. His mind is at equanimity. No matter what the situation is, he sees the same reality. The goal is to reach a stage where you start seeing that myself is the same as yourself. Yourself is same as his self and herself. And now all beings are nothing but the expression of same self.\n\nSo Arjuna had a doubt. This looks like a pipe dream to me. This looks like something far fetched somewhere. Because the very goal is to turn the mind towards itself. Detaching it from all the attachments it has. That really does not seem like a very viable proposition.\n\nSo get a doubt and say, I don't see this happening. This mind is so chanchal then so unstable that it is like trying to control wind. We all know that controlling wind is not something in our hand. No matter how much technological advances we are. When hurricane comes, all you can do is just watch on tv. But you cannot really control.\n\nYou can say, let me now turn the hurricane's path. So the mind is like that hurricane. Typically our mind is in a turbulent shape. It's not easy to control. Then Bhagavan said, that's correct. That mind is Chanchala Nasthir but Abhyasena.\n\nBy constant practice it can be tamed. The circus animals, they are tamed to do some amazing things. Elephants standing on two legs, you know, Dog jumping through fire. By constant practice even this mind can be tamed. The circus animals can be tamed. Your mind also can be tamed by practice and Vairagyana and by dispassion.\n\nMore you detach from outside. More you detach from your body. More you detach from your intellect. Mind is free to go and attach to the self. More I am as I consider me today. More difficult it is for mind to go and attach it to the self.\n\nHe said Abhyasena in Vairagyana, two pointers given by Bhagavan. Mind cannot be tamed. Bhagavan said, no, it can be. Don't underestimate the power of your mind. That it's Pramathini. Even any powerful thing also can be tamed.\n\nSo we Talked about the hydro power Water, when it is flooding, has a great capacity to create destruction. The same water can be tamed into a hydro dam and create energy. So the same mind which has this tremendous energy to take you away from your goal, that same energy can be harnessed and cultivated to find yourself. Bhaiya Vyasayana vairagya. The two pointers Bhagwangya. So it dispelled his doubt.\n\nNarjuna has a different doubt. So he says, and these doubts are very universal. These doubts are universal. In the path of seeking the truth, every seeker comes to seek doubt. First thing we hear is this chapter is great, but meditation is not easy. So Bhagavan said, okay, if you are really serious, keep trying.\n\nKeep trying and keep trying and try and try again, boys. You will succeed at last. You know, you will continue trying and you will achieve that. Now is another doubt because we know that this life is limited. Just looking at all the things which is happening. We have one of our friend died last week.\n\nBiswanath Basu went to India. He wrote back saying, my father went to surgery. Thank you very much for prayers. And yesterday he sent a note saying his father Pasta Ben. So people, in May I think maybe I have very little time left. Neil, finish all the podcast and what do we want to do is quickly Arjuna watch verse 30.\n\nAyyatihi sradaya upetaha Yoga Sadaya Upedah I have complete faith. I have faith that this is right. This is the path I must be following. That is not a problem. Intellectually I'm convinced this is the right path. And that's my goal, is to find the truth myself.\n\nBut Ayatihi, because of the uncontrolled self, no control over my senses. Yoga Chalitamanasah the mind wavers away from this yoga. Every new year we make resolution. I said, I don't have much time left. You know, my passion is singing. And I know I'm getting old, my voice is going.\n\nSo I said, let me before my voice goes away, I need to practice and maybe record another album or something like that. And then after a while I fall into the same. There's not enough time. Architecture practice is more important. So even though I have faith and I have a goal, but Yoga Chalithamara mind wavers away from this yoga to attach itself to the goal. Prapya Yoga San Siddhyam so he is not achieving.\n\nSo I have not achieved the Yoga San Siddhim. I have not achieved the perfection in yoga. Kam Gatim Krishna Gachati. What happens to that person? He had all the faith, trying hard but because of uncontrolled self, senses and mind wandered away from the yoga and he dies. Time is over, time is up.\n\nKacchit Na Ubhaya Vibrastha Chinna Abram Ivanashyati. Doesn't he get destroyed like the torn cloud, the shattered cloud? Our basically dilemma is should I be doing this or should I be doing that? Should I be focusing on my materialistic world and achieve accomplishment there Or I should be pursuing the path of spirituality. See, if I just focus on one, maybe I can get success. But doing both, it may not be possible.\n\nWhen we came to this town and we started these classes, a couple of our friends who made new friends, they said Neil, they are businessmen, said Neil, as much time you are putting in this Bhagavad Gita classes in Balvi and all that, if you put in business, you can make lots of money. And my friends at Chinmay Mission said Neil, as much time you're putting in your architectural practice if you put as much time in this. When I left Houston and I was completely immersed into this Vedanta, I had just come to United States, Swamiji has come to United States. And I got inspired and started going to Gaurang Bai's classes. So when I got a job and I said Gaurang bhai, I need to go to Dallas. So he said Neil, then what will happen to all this?\n\nI said Gaurang bhai, I have only one desire to design high rise building. And that's why I came to United States once I get this chance. Because I was working for a company which does nothing but high rise building. Or at least I got a job. He said, once I fulfill my desire, I'm going to focus on this. It's never going to happen.\n\nAnd it's true, I'm continue to practice architecture. So should I really now consider that I'm going to be lost from both sides?",
      "reflection": "Try even five minutes of stillness today. Don't worry about doing it correctly. Simply sit, close your eyes, and notice what's happening in your field of awareness.\n\nWhen the mind wanders—and it will—gently bring it back. This gentle returning is the practice. Each time you notice wandering and return, you're strengthening the muscle of awareness. The Gita is clear: the mind is restless and difficult to control, but through practice and dispassion, it can be mastered.\n\nConsider: What is your relationship with your own mind? Are you its master, or does it control you? The practice of meditation is the practice of reclaiming sovereignty over your own inner world."

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing Chapter 6, Dhyana Yoga, Yoga of Meditation. And obviously this is the conclusion of all the discussion we had about ourselves, who we are, what we consider ourselves to be, what we should be considering ourselves to be and how to get there. Right now I'm identified with this limited being called me, my body, mind and intellect. Chapter two said, your goal is to identify with the one which is imperishable. Then we have talked about how to do this through Karma Yoga by doing greater good selfless activities to purify your mind and intellectual so that it starts seeing the reality as is without coloring it through your vasanas and desires and aspirations and goals. And then when I go through that process, we had been told how to now train your mind to not go outside.\n\nSo wherever our mind goes, that's where our attachment goes. That's where identification is. My mind goes to my leg. And therefore my identification is more stronger with the body at the time. Nothing, no great ideas are important that time. Look, my leg is hurting.\n\nLet me tell you about theory of evolution. So wherever a mind goes, that's where my identification is. Mind has now tendency to go out in this world and attach do many things create new attachments every day. So we learned that the goal is now to withdraw the mind, make it inward towards yourself and attach it to yourself. When we get to that point, what will be our experience and we have Learned in verse 29 says Sarva Bhutastam Atmanam Sarva Bhutani Chaatma. Right now I think this is me.\n\nI am in the center of my world. You are in the center of your world. She is in the center of her world. He is in the center of his world. And whenever world collides, that's our relationship. Sometimes they overlaps in a pleasant way and we have friendly encounter.\n\nSometimes they collide very violently and we have conflicts. When my goal and your goal is to achieve the same object, then we are on a collision course as we see in the debates last night, in the very first debate when there are 15 candidates, Donald Trump said, Ted Cruz is a good guy. He is not capable, but he is my friend. Gradually yesterday, he is a liar. He is a liar, nothing but a liar. They are both going toward the same object and they are on a collision course.\n\nSo our worlds are separate and they come and collide with each other in various ways because we all have different worlds. But once the mind is turned towards inward, Bhagavan said, you will find that the self which you call yourself is not only just yourself, but the same self in all the beings. There are not too many different selves, the one self expressing through all the beings. So therefore, Sarva Bhutastam Atmanam I see that this same self is residing in all the beings. What I consider my consciousness is the same consciousness for you and him and she and her. In Sarva Bhutani Ch'.\n\nAatmani not only that, I will also see that the self is not in the beings. Actually, the beings are in the self. Our standard analogy, the this space is in this room. The next door room has its own space. So this room space and that room space have some relationship. They belong to the same building.\n\nSo they are basically related to each other more friendly way. So this space and that space, how did I create them? By putting a partition between in the space, the one space. I put a partition created two space. Now did I really divide the space or I put a partition in the space? I actually put the partition in the space space remaining what it is, I just put a partition in.\n\nSo now is it the space within the partitions or the partitions are within the space? Those of you who have been attending Gita class for a long time know that the partition is in the space. This room used to be much larger partition. The same way, when I start visualizing that all these buildings in this world are actually in the space, not that the space is in the building. So when I turn my gaze towards myself, not only I find that my self is something other than this body, mind and intellect, but the same self is expressing through all the body. All the beings and all the beings are nothing but in the space.\n\nBecause the self is all pervading, just as the space is all pervading. So no matter what building I create in, no matter where on this planet or in another universe, it's still the same space. Iksate Yoga Yukta Tma, Sarvatraha Samadharsanaha One who has become the Yoga Yukta. One who has mastered the yoga. Yoga is to connect one who has mastered that connection of removing this identification from this outside world to inside. Sarvatra Samadarsana.\n\nHe becomes equanimous in all his vision. His mind is at equanimity. No matter what the situation is, he sees the same reality. The goal is to reach a stage where you start seeing that myself is the same as yourself. Yourself is same as his self and herself. And now all beings are nothing but the expression of same self.\n\nSo Arjuna had a doubt. This looks like a pipe dream to me. This looks like something far fetched somewhere. Because the very goal is to turn the mind towards itself. Detaching it from all the attachments it has. That really does not seem like a very viable proposition.\n\nSo get a doubt and say, I don't see this happening. This mind is so chanchal then so unstable that it is like trying to control wind. We all know that controlling wind is not something in our hand. No matter how much technological advances we are. When hurricane comes, all you can do is just watch on tv. But you cannot really control.\n\nYou can say, let me now turn the hurricane's path. So the mind is like that hurricane. Typically our mind is in a turbulent shape. It's not easy to control. Then Bhagavan said, that's correct. That mind is Chanchala Nasthir but Abhyasena.\n\nBy constant practice it can be tamed. The circus animals, they are tamed to do some amazing things. Elephants standing on two legs, you know, Dog jumping through fire. By constant practice even this mind can be tamed. The circus animals can be tamed. Your mind also can be tamed by practice and Vairagyana and by dispassion.\n\nMore you detach from outside. More you detach from your body. More you detach from your intellect. Mind is free to go and attach to the self. More I am as I consider me today. More difficult it is for mind to go and attach it to the self.\n\nHe said Abhyasena in Vairagyana, two pointers given by Bhagavan. Mind cannot be tamed. Bhagavan said, no, it can be. Don't underestimate the power of your mind. That it's Pramathini. Even any powerful thing also can be tamed.\n\nSo we Talked about the hydro power Water, when it is flooding, has a great capacity to create destruction. The same water can be tamed into a hydro dam and create energy. So the same mind which has this tremendous energy to take you away from your goal, that same energy can be harnessed and cultivated to find yourself. Bhaiya Vyasayana vairagya.

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing Chapter 6, Dhana Yoga, Yoga of Meditation and we are coming to the conclusion of this chapter. We are also coming to the conclusion of the first segment of Bhagavad Gita. As we had discussed many times before, Bhagavad Gita is divided into three segments. First six chapters deal with who I am at this limited being as an individual. Next six chapters will deal with who that ultimate reality is. The last three chapters will deal with how you can synchronize these two.\n\nSo we are coming to the end of the first segment of Bhagavad Gita and what we have learned so far is in the chapter one we have learnt about our own situation, that our situation is not clear cut in life. Things don't come in life as clear as black and white. It comes in various shades of gray. That was the first chapter, Arjuna Vishada Yoga that confuses us. Chapter two gave us a thumbnail sketch the entire knowledge of Bhagavad Gita, Upanishada and Brahma Sutra. What is reality and what is perceived to be my reality?\n\nRight now I consider myself to be mortal. I had a beginning and I'll have an end. And the elder Bhagwan said, your self is imperishable, immutable. And we have come to this stage by passing through many, many, many experiences in different states of existence. Chapter third through five gave us the instruction of how to optimize our performance in this life using the equipment which we have. Dealing with the cards which are dealt with.\n\nHow do you optimize your game? That was the topic of chapter third through fifth. And chapter six gave us the instruction how to now raise your plateau. I'm comfortable dealing in this sphere. How do I now go a step above that? You may be a local level politician going through the school board elections.\n\nThen I want to do at the state level. Then I want to do at a national level. Well, how do I raise my plateau is the topic of chapter 6, Dhyana Yoga Yoga of meditation. All my focus right now is this body, this mind, this intellect and this world. Now how do I conduct transaction in this world and how do I optimize it? That's what we have learned.\n\nChapter six is, now that you have learned how to optimize your performance in this world, go to the next level of finding out what is the real nature of the self is there was meditation. We have learned in this process that there are two ways to get there. The definition we have learnt is the one who gives us the fruits of actions is a Karma Yogi. One who gives up the sense of agency that I am the doer is a Sanyasi. Both reach the same goal of realizing the truth, the self. That changes my identification from this to that.\n\nSo we have elaborate discussion about how to meditate. And then we have come to the last portion of it where Arjuna had two doubts. First is we are talking about controlling our mind. My experience so far is mind is so fickle. Controlling it doesn't seem like an achievable goal. And Bhagavan said it can be done by Abhyasa in Vairagya, by constant practice, by forming a habit.\n\nOnce you form a habit, it becomes very easy. It becomes automatic action. So that's Abhyasa in a Vairagya. To form a habit in one sphere, you have to undo your habits in the other sphere, which is Vairagya, you have to give up what you are tattooed right now to do something else. And then Arjuna had the second doubt. I sincerely try all these things, but then I run out of time.\n\nThen what happens to all my efforts? Will that be all in vain? That I have lost on both hands? That I have not enjoyed my life here in the material world? And also I'm not making any progress in my spiritual evolution. In response to that, we have seen that the concept of reincarnation was reintroduced in this chapter.\n\nWhere I am today is the sum total of all my experiences before. What I'm doing with my total experiences now in my present today, that will make my future. This life is a continuum. This existence is a continuum. Whether I exist in this form or the other. When I was born, I was a baby.\n\nI existed as a baby for a while, then as a teenager, then as a young man. But I exist all through this. So will you exist in your future state of existence we call a rebirth. And there he gives us assurance. Fruits of all your efforts will be with you. You will carry your bank balance.\n\nIf I retire from my practice here and leave United States and go to India, what will happen to all my bank balance? It will come with you. It will be transferable. You can convert into rupees much better. So all that we have done will come with us in our next life. That's the Nashville.\n\nSo the last few verses which you have seen say that the Yogi who had been striving to achieve this but cannot come see, falls from his path for whatever reason, runs out of time, get distracted. He said then he will get a place in his next birthday in a conducive environment. Suchinam srimatam Gehei. He will take birth in the house of a pure and wealthy. So he will have conducive environment to pursue his path. This is what he will then go and fulfill all his desires.\n\nBhagavan guarantees that all your desires will be fulfilled sooner or later. As long as you have a strong desire to achieve something, to experience something, you will achieve it sooner or later. Most of the things I wanted to do in my 20s, I finally got it in 60s. So it takes that much time. But you will be the assurance is all your desires will be fulfilled. You will have time to exhaust them.\n\nThen continue pursuing your path again. That if the Yogi had some desires left to pursue, but those who have no desire, they purely in the path of this yoga, but ran out of time. He said they will take birth in a home of a yogi where the utmost was conducive for him to start his journey right away, to continue on his path. And then the last few verses talks about what will happen once you take that next birth. Tatratam buddhi sahyogam labate Parva DEI kam. Parva dehikam in the last life, the knowledge which you have gathered through your efforts in yoga, in meditation, in a Karma yoga, whatever practice you have done.\n\nThis is also true for all our secular efforts as well. That's why we have talked about the child prodigies, musical geniuses, mathematical geniuses. Our culture doesn't consider there's an accident or just a random happening. It's a systematic evolution of that intellect to come to that point. They say what he gets Buddhisa Yogam, he gets associated with his buddhi, what he has developed in his last birth. Yata te chatta tah bhuyah sansid DHA kuru Nandana and then he strives even more than before, because now he gets even more encouraged by his own accomplishments, his own provinces.\n\nYou know, the child who is good at mathematics. He will be more encouraged to learn more and more quickly because he gets encouraged by his own success. Nothing succeeds like success and nothing feels like failure. Once you get this taste of success, you go more and more so there Yatatech there driving even more than before. He will achieve that perfection. Guru Nandana so he addresses Arjuna as Kuru Nandana.\n\nYou are the son of the Kuru dynasty. Remind them how did you come to this jackpot that you were born in a Kuru dynasty as a prince because of your past karmas. You and I constantly question why I have this situation, and the others have better situation than I. But we never question why I have better situation than those who do not. We have come to this situation by our own efforts. Hinduism doesn't give any other choice but to put all the responsibilities on you.\n\nYou are the architect of your own destiny, even your parents. You have chosen yourself as per our scriptures. Which house will I buy when I move out from my current house? Whatever the bank balance I have created and what the neighbor, I think will be the best. That's where I'm going to go and buy a house, right? There may be hundreds of other nice neighbors.\n\nI never knew about it or never thought they would be conducive for me. I go to some of these farmhouses and really wonder why people want to live here. One it looks so scary for miles. You know, there's nobody if something happens at night to take a grocery or drive probably another 20 miles to buy a grocery. But they say, no, no, we live in farmhouse because that's what that person thought is the right way to live for me. Put me in the densest neighborhood and I'll be very, very happy.\n\nSo each one of us decides what is best for us. And that is what Bhagavan gives. Bhagavan is so compassionate. So there he says, in your new situation you will be associated with your intellect, which you are gathered in the Pavadaya in your past existence. And there you will try even more to achieve the perfection, reminding Arjuna and all of us, how did we come to this stage because of our past effort, why we are in Gita group and not in some other place. Because your own efforts you gathered this interest to learn Bhagavad Gita.\n\nNext verse says Purva Bhyasena Tenay vahi riyate yavaso API saha Jignasu API yogasya Sabda brahma ati vartate. By that very formal practice with his born with in spite of himself, in spite of whatever the circumstances are, because of a purva Bhyasa, by your previous experiences, studies, you will make progress. See, when we left India, Mohandas Gandhi when he left India to go to London for his studies, what did his mother say? You will not do the following. You will not eat meat. You will not do this.\n\nThat was the fear that when you leave your country, you will be influenced by the other culture and forget your own culture, your own values, your own, your own traditions. Look what's happening here. We have more Gita classes and the Bala Vihar classes here in this country than when I was growing up in India. There were no Gita class. I was going because of your own vasanas, you continue wherever you go. Swamiji gives this example that somebody's parents came and he was very worried.\n\nHow will I keep my father engaged after all? I found out that his father himself found a company in the neighborhood because he was great at Tinpathi. He somehow, whether he speaks English or not, he found people in the neighborhood who plays Tinpathi and he made his friends by himself. With your own vasana, we will find our own environment to fit in. In that in spite of whatever the environment you are in, you will strive harder and jignasu API with curiosity. What is that perfection which I need to achieve?\n\nYoga shya Sabha Brahmadi vratate. With that Yoga, he will go beyond Sabda Brahma. Now, these are the final few verses are actually the preface to the next chapter. So you will come across new introduction Sabda Brahma. We all have learned that in our culture the sound symbol of God is Om.",
      "reflection": "Try even five minutes of stillness today. Don't worry about doing it correctly. Simply sit, close your eyes, and notice what's happening in your field of awareness.\n\nWhen the mind wanders—and it will—gently bring it back. This gentle returning is the practice. Each time you notice wandering and return, you're strengthening the muscle of awareness. The Gita is clear: the mind is restless and difficult to control, but through practice and dispassion, it can be mastered.\n\nConsider: What is your relationship with your own mind? Are you its master, or does it control you? The practice of meditation is the practice of reclaiming sovereignty over your own inner world."

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing Chapter 6, Dhana Yoga, Yoga of Meditation and we are coming to the conclusion of this chapter. We are also coming to the conclusion of the first segment of Bhagavad Gita. As we had discussed many times before, Bhagavad Gita is divided into three segments. First six chapters deal with who I am at this limited being as an individual. Next six chapters will deal with who that ultimate reality is. The last three chapters will deal with how you can synchronize these two.\n\nSo we are coming to the end of the first segment of Bhagavad Gita and what we have learned so far is in the chapter one we have learnt about our own situation, that our situation is not clear cut in life. Things don't come in life as clear as black and white. It comes in various shades of gray. That was the first chapter, Arjuna Vishada Yoga that confuses us. Chapter two gave us a thumbnail sketch the entire knowledge of Bhagavad Gita, Upanishada and Brahma Sutra. What is reality and what is perceived to be my reality?\n\nRight now I consider myself to be mortal. I had a beginning and I'll have an end. And the elder Bhagwan said, your self is imperishable, immutable. And we have come to this stage by passing through many, many, many experiences in different states of existence. Chapter third through five gave us the instruction of how to optimize our performance in this life using the equipment which we have. Dealing with the cards which are dealt with.\n\nHow do you optimize your game? That was the topic of chapter third through fifth. And chapter six gave us the instruction how to now raise your plateau. I'm comfortable dealing in this sphere. How do I now go a step above that? You may be a local level politician going through the school board elections.\n\nThen I want to do at the state level. Then I want to do at a national level. Well, how do I raise my plateau is the topic of chapter 6, Dhyana Yoga Yoga of meditation. All my focus right now is this body, this mind, this intellect and this world. Now how do I conduct transaction in this world and how do I optimize it? That's what we have learned.\n\nChapter six is, now that you have learned how to optimize your performance in this world, go to the next level of finding out what is the real nature of the self is there was meditation. We have learned in this process that there are two ways to get there. The definition we have learnt is the one who gives us the fruits of actions is a Karma Yogi. One who gives up the sense of agency that I am the doer is a Sanyasi. Both reach the same goal of realizing the truth, the self. That changes my identification from this to that.\n\nSo we have elaborate discussion about how to meditate. And then we have come to the last portion of it where Arjuna had two doubts. First is we are talking about controlling our mind. My experience so far is mind is so fickle. Controlling it doesn't seem like an achievable goal. And Bhagavan said it can be done by Abhyasa in Vairagya, by constant practice, by forming a habit.\n\nOnce you form a habit, it becomes very easy. It becomes automatic action. So that's Abhyasa in a Vairagya. To form a habit in one sphere, you have to undo your habits in the other sphere, which is Vairagya, you have to give up what you are tattooed right now to do something else. And then Arjuna had the second doubt. I sincerely try all these things, but then I run out of time.\n\nThen what happens to all my efforts? Will that be all in vain? That I have lost on both hands? That I have not enjoyed my life here in the material world? And also I'm not making any progress in my spiritual evolution. In response to that, we have seen that the concept of reincarnation was reintroduced in this chapter.\n\nWhere I am today is the sum total of all my experiences before. What I'm doing with my total experiences now in my present today, that will make my future. This life is a continuum. This existence is a continuum. Whether I exist in this form or the other. When I was born, I was a baby.\n\nI existed as a baby for a while, then as a teenager, then as a young man. But I exist all through this. So will you exist in your future state of existence we call a rebirth. And there he gives us assurance. Fruits of all your efforts will be with you. You will carry your bank balance.\n\nIf I retire from my practice here and leave United States and go to India, what will happen to all my bank balance? It will come with you. It will be transferable. You can convert into rupees much better. So all that we have done will come with us in our next life. That's the Nashville.\n\nSo the last few verses which you have seen say that the Yogi who had been striving to achieve this but cannot come see, falls from his path for whatever reason, runs out of time, get distracted. He said then he will get a place in his next birthday in a conducive environment. Suchinam srimatam Gehei. He will take birth in the house of a pure and wealthy. So he will have conducive environment to pursue his path. This is what he will then go and fulfill all his desires.\n\nBhagavan guarantees that all your desires will be fulfilled sooner or later. As long as you have a strong desire to achieve something, to experience something, you will achieve it sooner or later. Most of the things I wanted to do in my 20s, I finally got it in 60s. So it takes that much time. But you will be the assurance is all your desires will be fulfilled. You will have time to exhaust them.\n\nThen continue pursuing your path again. That if the Yogi had some desires left to pursue, but those who have no desire, they purely in the path of this yoga, but ran out of time. He said they will take birth in a home of a yogi where the utmost was conducive for him to start his journey right away, to continue on his path. And then the last few verses talks about what will happen once you take that next birth. Tatratam buddhi sahyogam labate Parva DEI kam. Parva dehikam in the last life, the knowledge which you have gathered through your efforts in yoga, in meditation, in a Karma yoga, whatever practice you have done.\n\nThis is also true for all our secular efforts as well. That's why we have talked about the child prodigies, musical geniuses, mathematical geniuses. Our culture doesn't consider there's an accident or just a random happening. It's a systematic evolution of that intellect to come to that point. They say what he gets Buddhisa Yogam, he gets associated with his buddhi, what he has developed in his last birth. Yata te chatta tah bhuyah sansid DHA kuru Nandana and then he strives even more than before, because now he gets even more encouraged by his own accomplishments, his own provinces.\n\nYou know, the child who is good at mathematics. He will be more encouraged to learn more and more quickly because he gets encouraged by his own success. Nothing succeeds like success and nothing feels like failure. Once you get this taste of success, you go more and more so there Yatatech there driving even more than before. He will achieve that perfection. Guru Nandana so he addresses Arjuna as Kuru Nandana.\n\nYou are the son of the Kuru dynasty. Remind them how did you come to this jackpot that you were born in a Kuru dynasty as a prince because of your past karmas. You and I constantly question why I have this situation, and the others have better situation than I. But we never question why I have better situation than those who do not. We have come to this situation by our own efforts. Hinduism doesn't give any other choice but to put all the responsibilities on you.\n\nYou are the architect of your own destiny, even your parents. You have chosen yourself as per our scriptures. Which house will I buy when I move out from my current house? Whatever the bank balance I have created and what the neighbor, I think will be the best. That's where I'm going to go and buy a house, right? There may be hundreds of other nice neighbors.\n\nI never knew about it or never thought they would be conducive for me. I go to some of these farmhouses and really wonder why people want to live here. One it looks so scary for miles. You know, there's nobody if something happens at night to take a grocery or drive probably another 20 miles to buy a grocery. But they say, no, no, we live in farmhouse because that's what that person thought is the right way to live for me. Put me in the densest neighborhood and I'll be very, very happy.\n\nSo each one of us decides what is best for us. And that is what Bhagavan gives. Bhagavan is so compassionate. So there he says, in your new situation you will be associated with your intellect, which you are gathered in the Pavadaya in your past existence. And there you will try even more to achieve the perfection, reminding Arjuna and all of us, how did we come to this stage because of our past effort, why we are in Gita group and not in some other place. Because your own efforts you gathered this interest to learn Bhagavad Gita.\n\nNext verse says Purva Bhyasena Tenay vahi riyate yavaso API saha Jignasu API yogasya Sabda brahma ati vartate. By that very formal practice with his born with in spite of himself, in spite of whatever the circumstances are, because of a purva Bhyasa, by your previous experiences, studies, you will make progress. See, when we left India, Mohandas Gandhi when he left India to go to London for his studies, what did his mother say? You will not do the following. You will not eat meat. You will not do this.\n\nThat was the fear that when you leave your country, you will be influenced by the other culture and forget your own culture, your own values, your own, your own traditions. Look what's happening here. We have more Gita classes and the Bala Vihar classes here in this country than when I was growing up in India. There were no Gita class. I was going because of your own vasanas, you continue wherever you go. Swamiji gives this example that somebody's parents came and he was very worried.\n\nHow will I keep my father engaged after all? I found out that his father himself found a company in the neighborhood because he was great at Tinpathi. He somehow, whether he speaks English or not, he found people in the neighborhood who plays Tinpathi and he made his friends by himself. With your own vasana, we will find our own environment to fit in. In that in spite of whatever the environment you are in, you will strive harder and jignasu API with curiosity. What is that perfection which I need to achieve?\n\nYoga shya Sabha Brahmadi vratate. With that Yoga, he will go beyond Sabda Brahma. Now, these are the final few verses are actually the preface to the next chapter. So you will come across new introduction Sabda Brahma. We all have learned that in our culture the sound symbol of God is Om.",
      "reflection": "Try even five minutes of stillness today. Don't worry about doing it correctly. Simply sit, close your eyes, and notice what's happening in your field of awareness.\n\nWhen the mind wanders—and it will—gently bring it back. This gentle returning is the practice. Each time you notice wandering and return, you're strengthening the muscle of awareness. The Gita is clear: the mind is restless and difficult to control, but through practice and dispassion, it can be mastered.\n\nConsider: What is your relationship with your own mind? Are you its master, or does it control you? The practice of meditation is the practice of reclaiming sovereignty over your own inner world."

      "commentary": "Unlike a car with its user's manual, we are born without instructions how to live. We experience life vicissitudes without a so called user's manual. The Gita has been described as such a guide. We have seen that the first six chapters described Jivatma. Obviously the science which we are interested in is that of the self. What is the nature of my being?\n\nThat's the quest in learning Bhagavad Gita. That's what we are trying to learn. The self In Sanskrit, Atma. The self is what I'm trying to figure out, what it is. So the first six chapters taught me what the conditioned self is called. Jivatma, you and I call myself.\n\nThis is me, this myself, this is yourself. That self is conditioned by my perception of who I am. And that self, I call it myself. That I refer to my body, my mind, my intellect and all the things which I have achieved is me. So that's Jivatma Esperance Vedanta. That is nothing but a conditioned self.\n\nConditioned by this body, mind and intellect. Just as this room space is space, just as a space outside. But I call this is a room space because it's conditioned by the room. Room is made up of four walls, a floor and a ceiling. If you take one of that away, it's not a motor room, but it is still a space conditioned by this conditioning which we have created. Space was always here.\n\nI created the conditioning. Now I call it a room space. I created conditioning as me. This body, this mind, this intellect is me that they called it Jiva Atma. Every conditioned being is a Jivatma. And who that is, as we have discussed in detail in the first six chapters and say who I am, how I act with this world, what the consequences of in a manner of acting, how do I avoid sorrows and unhappiness?\n\nSo we talked about all the things we talked about. Karma Yoga ended up into meditation is the culmination of that quest which someone may say, it's a Raja Yoga. We started with Karma yoga, graduated to meditation, the Dhyana Yoga, Raja Yoga. Now we need to know where do I go from here? Where we want to go from here is I understood what Jivatma is. I need to now understand who Paramatma is.\n\nSo supreme self, space, room space, universal space. I understood the room space is, but my mind right now can't grasp what the universal space is. So I now need to graduate from room space to understand the universal space. And my mind has to come to a conclusion what universal space is. And for that I first start with understanding what a Jivatma is or a conditioned self is to the Paramatma, the supreme self is. So the next six chapters will tell us about Ishvara, the Lord Almighty who is the creator of this universe, who is in control of all the Jivatma.\n\nAll Jivatmas are functioning because of Ishwara. All room space in all the rooms in the world are there because of universal space. But I right now only understand the conditions of. I'm not graduating to a universal space from Jivatma. I'm migrating to Paramatma. I may not understand him in its essence, so I now need to come down to one level below him as the creator.\n\nHim as the controller of all the beings that whom we call Ishvara. My friends who know me, they may not know me as an architect, but my clients know me as architect. So I can only relate to them in the relationship they understand with me. Or they can only understand me with the relationship they know me. I is the creation of the Creator. If I can understand my relationship with him, the creation and a creator, that's easier other than finding out who he is in all its entirety.\n\nSo we'll start with Ishvara, the one who created this universe as I. And you can perceive, feel and touch, which is called Prakriti in Sanskrit. The one who is in control of the Prakriti is Purusha. So the first six chapter, the next six chapters will do that. And that has to culminate into devotion for that Paramatma. For me to know someone in his or her entirety, I need to identify with him or her.\n\nThat identification becomes love. For me to know Paramatma, I need to devote myself to Paramatma. I need to start identifying with that Paramatma. That identification will become devotion. So these six chapters will culminate into 12th chapter Bhakti Yoga, the yoga of devotion. We started with Karma Yoga.\n\nWe graduated to Raja Yoga. We're now marching towards Bhakti Yoga, the yoga of devotion. So these first three verses, Bhagavan has now realized in the last six chapter, the last verse set up the stage and said, the one who wants to know even yoga, just a curiosity. I really want to know what yoga is all about. He's better than the Karma Kandi. The one who is simply doing rituals.\n\nI'm a very religious person. I need to have my business run properly. Bhagavan's, you know, grace. I need early morning before I go to my job or work or I need to do the puja, you know, quickly, as quickly as I can. Before 8 o', clock, I do puja and run. I'm done with Bhagavan today.\n\nThen I say, well, now things are getting even hectic. I actually asked somebody in India, really literally, and I said, well, what about puja? Because you now go around as a job shopper or whatever you call it isn't Neil. I just go on online and I have this website. When say Ganpati Puja, Ganpati Murti comes in, there is agarbatti on the side. You click on the agarbatti, Agarbati lights up, you click on the lamp, the lamp lights up and you click on the garland.\n\nGarland comes on, you click on the aarti and say, I can do it anywhere now. So it's very, very easy. So we say that's a Karmakanda. I decided that I have to do this for me to be on the good side of the Lord is a Karma Khandi. Bhagavan said, even one who wants to know yoga is better than Karma Kandi. I may not have any interest in performing yoga, but I want to know Yoga is I'm at least better than that.\n\nThen obviously, thus say the yogi is better than a Gnani, a Tapasvi or even a Sanyasi. Because yogi is the one who has given up everything in terms of fruits, of actions and is relying on the Karma Falad to give him the Karma fala. I'll do my duty as his vehicle. I'm just in Mittmatra. My actions are there because I'm empowered by the Lord to do this. I can speak because I'm alive.\n\nI'm alive because the consciousness is still functioning through this body. That consciousness belongs to the Supreme Consciousness. You and I are conscious of each other because the same consciousness functioning through me is. Is Functioning through you. If you had two incompatible programming, we wouldn't be talking to each other. Two computers don't talk to each other.\n\nIf one is on Windows and whatever the software language is, they don't talk to each other. But we can, because the same consciousness is functioning through you and I. So Bhagawan said, therefore the one who has given up his sense of I am in control and give him, he's a yogi and he's better than all of that. See, now Bhagavan says the Arjuna is all charged up and wants to know. The seventh chapter continues and says, gnana Vignana Yoga, Yoga of knowledge and wisdom. So what is the difference?\n\nWe obviously had a discussion last time. Knowledge is Gnana Vignana, Vignana. Something which I know is Gnana. Something which I do not know is obviously ignorance. Then Vignana Visheshtagnana. This is special knowledge.\n\nIn normal knowledge is I know you people are in the room. That's a knowledge because I can see and I can. I can vouch for it that you are here. The knowledge which I can perceive, feel and touch through my senses and knowledge. But that knowledge, we can process it and come to another conclusion is vignana. So the Swami Chidvanandal Bhagavad Gita which I have here because I thought I won't have this one.\n\nIt basically says the Gnana is a sight requires a sight. In other words, the senses Vignana is insight. Gnana required tuition, somebody to. For me to learn Bhagavad Gita, I had to go to Swami Chinnamananda. I can understand myself. Let me understand it.\n\nSide required tuition. The knowledge of what I learned requires intuition. Music is the one which I really understand well because I have a lot of difficulty learning that. I went to my teacher to learn that and he will say, Neel, do this sargam. You know, Subha says, it's too difficult. I know how to sing song.\n\nI said, no, no, you need to do this sargam. And while I was doing it, it was so difficult. And then he told me that one day it will come naturally to you and you yourself will understand how to do it. And I didn't believe him. But it did happen exactly that way. Things which I couldn't learn while he was teaching me, but I know what to do came naturally to me.\n\nAt one point of time when I was. I was trying to Practice it. I don't want to make any effort to figure out what it is because it became my own knowledge. It became intuitively I know what it is. I asked my nephew, who is a prodigy since he was about six years old, he can do any music he wants. So I asked him, Advaita, teach me how do I do this?\n\nHe said, uncle, I don't know how to teach you. I myself do not know how I'm doing it. I just know how to do it. So the vignana is the intuitive knowledge. Once you gather the knowledge and absorbed it as your own, intuitively you use it for its right application is vignana. So Bhagavan says, sometimes it's translated as wisdom.\n\nWisdom is something you really don't sit down and say, let's do this. Wisdom is somebody says something and you know what to do with it. It's an intuitive knowledge born out of the knowledge which you have created, the experiences you have. And that wisdom, you cannot claim your own because something in you has ability to grasp that knowledge that only you can do. When you're alive, you can't do it. When you're dead, you're conscious of it.\n\nYour consciousness is that entity who is the intuition. So Bhagavan said, I will tell you now. Yogam yunjan, mad ashrayha, asansayam sumagrammam, Yitha gnatsya sita. So he is a promise to all the beings who really want to know who they are or who. Paramatma said, now listen carefully, O Partha, because now I'll tell you, tell you what the knowledge and the wisdom is. But here are the prerequisites.\n\nWith your mind clinging to me and taking refuge in me and practicing Yoga, you will without any doubt know me in full. If you do three things. Bhagavan said, I'm going to tell you what you need to know. Your mind should be cling. Your mind should be focused on me. If I want to learn something, I obviously need to be focused on that.\n\nI want to find out how this, my BlackBerry works. I need to be focused on me. I still can't use all the features on my BlackBerry because I'm not focused, you know, I need to be focused on that.",
      "reflection": "Today, practice seeing the sacred in the ordinary. That person who annoyed you? A form of the divine. That sunset that took your breath away? The same. Can you hold both truths simultaneously?\n\nWhat would change if you moved through your day knowing that everything you encounter is, in its essence, a manifestation of the one divine reality? The Gita teaches that the Lord pervades all things—not as a poetic metaphor, but as literal truth.\n\nNotice where you draw lines between sacred and secular in your life. What would happen if those lines dissolved?"

      "commentary": "Chapter 7 Gnana Vignana Yoga Yoga of Knowledge and its Application or realization or Wisdom. Whichever way we define the word Vignana, Vignan Visisthagnan Spatial Knowledge. Knowledge becomes special when we apply it. So it's an application of knowledge is Vignana. At the end of the last chapter, Bhagawan gave hint about what we'll be discussing in this chapter where he says, among the yogis whose inner self merge with me and worshipping me with faith is the greatest Yogi. So first of all, Bhagawan told Arjuna, in last six chapters they become Yogi serve a Sankalpasanyasi Yoga Rudha Duchyati.\n\nOne who is completely devoid of all sankalp, all fancy of mind about what can give me happiness and where my happiness lies is such a person as a yogi. So the advice was Bhagavan to Arjuna and all of us to become Yogi so that you can remove this parallax between Kath and Tvam in our understanding of myself, I am this limited being, this consciousness confined in this body, mind, intellect is me. In Bhagavan Singh, your consciousness is no different than the supreme Consciousness which is all pervading. That parallax I have to remove. I see these two selves, myself and supreme Self. How do I remove this parallax between these two and make it one is the goal.\n\nSo the Bhagwan said to meditate on the supreme self. Right now we are meditating on limited self. We are constantly in the state of Samadhi that I am this limited being and therefore I am in love with it. Everything I do, everything I accomplish, I am very proud of it. So Bhagawan said, that's because you are in the constant Samadhi of being. This limited self, you now have to contemplate on your supreme self, which is God, Brahman, the Ishvara, whatever the name we give him.\n\nThe problem is we really have no idea about what that self is all about. We've heard about it we have been indicated by Bhagavad in second chapter. But how can I devote myself to it? To devote myself I have to have devotion. Devotion is nothing but love for the Divine. And love is nothing but identification.\n\nIdentification only comes I have complete understanding or knowledge about that thing or a being. More I know about that thing or a being, more I identify with it or him or her, then more I love that person or thing or a being. So to merge myself to love the Divine, to devote myself to the Divine, I need to know the nature of that Divine. So Bhagawan has devoted the entire Chapter 7 for those who have reached that state of desire, Mumukshatvam that I need to be one with that Bhagawan has given in the first three verses. Introduction this is the three qualities you are going to require to achieve this Mind should be in love with me. Asakta1 who has the attachment so mind should be attached to him.\n\nThe supreme may here Bhagwant the Supreme Yoga. Myunjan who has become Yogi just has been described in the previous chapters Sarvasankalpa, Sanyasi and Mat Ashtarayaha who is taking refuge only in me, who knows that his liberation, his ultimate happiness lies in identifying with that Brahman only. There is no other source of long lasting everlasting happiness. All other things can give me temporary joy but not long lasting happiness. O Sansayam, without doubt I will tell you how you can achieve that. Babhagawan had given indication and the very first indication he gives us is that where to find him in this world we never see Bhagavan, never come across in my transactions anywhere.\n\nWhere is he and what is he? This is the first verse each seeker can relate to and contemplate. Bhagawan said, you see me every day. Everything that you see, hear, touch, smell through your senses is nothing but me. Everything in this world is made up of these five great elements. But these five great elements do not create any experience unless there is a knower.\n\nSo to create the sense objects out of these five great elements, you need a Knower. And the knower is Mana Buddhi Ahankar. These five great elements create the sense objects which are knowables. In this 3 Mana Buddhyana Hankar creates the Knower, that which will know the sense objects. So corresponding to these five great elements we have the five sense object Sabbath, Parsa, Rupa, Rasa, Naganda. But they all reside in my mind.\n\nWe know from physics that the particles and atoms they do not have either color, shape or smell. But we see the colors smell. So this mind is the knower. It creates the sense objects to enjoy Ithime bhinna prakriti astidaha. This world of knowables in knower and the experiences and exchanges between the knower and the knowables creates this lower Prakriti, the Eightfold Prakriti of mind. So know that anything which you see, anything when you touch, anything which you hear, is nothing but me alone, my manifestation only.\n\nThis is the very first exercise. One can do that every time he sees, he should remember that it is nothing but his manifestation and nothing. There is no other thing. And then he says, apara ayam ITI to anyam prakruti vidhi me param. So we may come to the conclusion. If I put all the things in this world together, then that's Bhagavan Bhagawan.\n\nIt is like if I have all the parts of Tesla in boxes or I can put a Tesla together. You need something else to make Tesla what Tesla is. So it says, apara ayam itutu annyam prakrutim vidhi me param. This is my lower Prakriti. Lower Prakrutin is the grosser manifestation. It is something which can be perceived by senses.\n\nThese five elements which we have described, I can see through my senses. Now the scientists can say, oh no, Neil, they were not knowledgeable enough. There are more than 100 elements. But these elements are related to my senses more the sense perception. The grosser the element is the space is the subtlest because we can only hear through the space. There is no other perception of space.\n\nBut the Bhoomi is the grossest because it can have all five perceptions. Starting from Sabdha, Sparsa, Rupa, Rasa gandh. Bhumi has all five of them. Space is only one Sabdha, and so on and so forth. So as the more sense perception the grosser the element is. Bhagwan said, this is my lower Prakriti which can be known through your senses.\n\nJivabhuta Mahabhaho Y yaya idam dharyate, jagat. But by which this world is upheld, this entire universe is sustained by that element that is my higher Prakriti Vidhi mehpara. Know that there is a higher Prakriti of mind which is sustaining both the knower and the knowable. The knower, the mind, Buddhi intellect and the Sense objects. It is only possible if there is a life in that knower. If there is a living force in the knower.\n\nThat living force is something completely different than mind, completely different than intellect and the world of perception. Itadh yonini bhutani sarvani ithyupadharaya. This is the womb of all the being. These two prakritis lower which is perceptible through my eyes and ears. And now we have additional means to perceive this world. So we have telescope and we have microscope.\n\nSo we have expanded our senses by adding those equipment. But no matter how far we can go, will never be able to perceive anything without the consciousness itself. Even a scientist who knows all about the electron and quarks and say that's the fundamental building blocks at least as we know, can only know if he's conscious about Etad yoni nibhutani sarvani itiyupadharaya. These two prakritis, lower Prakriti which is manifest and can be perceived through the senses can be understood by the intellect. Then the para which is unmanifest I do not know what the life force is all about. I do not know what consciousness is.\n\nI know I am conscious. I am aware that I exist, but I cannot define it. No science is yet successfully defined consciousness but once it's unmanifest cannot be described. This undescribable consciousness, indescribable world of matter are constituting the womb of all things and being no matter what it is. Aham kutsnasya jagatahar prabhabah pralay hatatta. Now Bhagavan says I'm actually slightly different than these two.\n\nI'm not just the lower Prakriti. I'm not just the higher Prakriti that just the womb of all the beings. But I am the source of both. I am the source of both the Prakritis, the para and apara Ahamkrishnasya jagatah pralayah. These all knowables and knowers, they come out of me. They also merge in me.\n\nIt is something like the entire world of my dream comes out of my own mind. And also it dissolves into my own mind. When I wake up, the world is gone. None of the things there is no knower of my dream or the knower bols in my dream are there because the mind is something higher than both the knower and knowables. In my dream the Bhagawan says I am the Brahman which projects itself as the Ishvara Through Maya, which creates Prakriti and also creates this mind. Buddhin Ahankar to know I'm higher than this Prana parabrakriti and I am the substratum for the creation and dissolution of this universe.\n\nIn our science we know everything about Big Bang. And up to the few seconds after the Big Bang, we just do not know what was the singularity and what was before the Big Bang. That we probably will never know, at least in our lifetime. The Bhagavan said, you can know everything about your Buddhi. But beyond Buddhi it is very difficult to know. Matthaha parataram na anyat kinchi dasti dhananjaya.\n\nThat which is the source of both this world, of my experiences and the experiencer. There is nothing more than that that which has created this life in me, that which I feel as myself. There is nothing beyond that. In other words, there is nothing subtler than that grosser the element, I can perceive it, subtler it is. It is difficult for me. Then it comes to a point where it is unperceptible.\n\nThere is nothing subtler than that self, the life itself, the consciousness itself. This is obviously very famous verse, a milestone verse, that this consciousness, this entity which cannot be described, cannot be perceived, cannot be thought of, is the source of all the things and being and all things and beings strung into it, in other words, are supported as this universe. This universe has laws, this universe has functions, this universe has activity depending on this Rajas, Tamas and Sattva. But all that is only possible because of that entity called consciousness. So the metaphor is about a necklace, a pearl necklace, where I can see pearls. The pearls are held in particular formation.\n\nAnd I know that there is something which is holding the pearls in that particular formation. But I do not see what it is. But I know that if you take that element out, the pulse will fall apart and scatter all over the floor. All is in this formation, as we call universe. Because of that underlying principle which is holding this formation together is my world. Continuous giving indication that what you should think about when you work in this world outside.\n\nRight now, my world is divided into I and the world, the two entities. But one is trying to bring them closer, to make that difference. What you are made up of, what the world is made up of, is one and the same thing. My body in my chair are made of the same material called the electron and quarks.",
      "reflection": "Today, practice seeing the sacred in the ordinary. That person who annoyed you? A form of the divine. That sunset that took your breath away? The same. Can you hold both truths simultaneously?\n\nWhat would change if you moved through your day knowing that everything you encounter is, in its essence, a manifestation of the one divine reality? The Gita teaches that the Lord pervades all things—not as a poetic metaphor, but as literal truth.\n\nNotice where you draw lines between sacred and secular in your life. What would happen if those lines dissolved?"

      "commentary": "Unlike a car with its user's manual, we are born without instructions how to live. We experience life vicissitudes without a so called user's manual. The Gita has been described as such a guide. We had been discussing chapter seven and chapter seven, as we have seen is a Gnan Vignan Yoga, Yoga of knowledge and wisdom. So in the beginning, Bhagavan said, I'm going to tell you who I am and I'll tell you all about it without leaving anything behind. And then he basically said that what you see in this world is my Eightfold Prakriti.\n\nWe all claim that we have never seen Bhagavan before. We have never seen God. We have never known him. Bhagawan to, you know me every day, you meet me every day. You just don't recognize it because what you see is the Bhoomi, apaha, analaha, kham, vayuhu, the five fold Prakriti, the element, the five elements which makes the entire world of ours. It is nothing but my own manifestation.\n\nThen he also had the mana, buddhi, ahankara, so five elements. When we think about, we only think about the insentient world, the world of matter. We say, well, we have nothing to really. We are human beings, we are living beings. No, even my mind, my intellect, my ego. Bhagavan said, that's my Prakriti.\n\nThat's my own nature, you know, it's my own manifestation. So when you include all of that, that includes all the beings and things, there's nothing left behind. He said, that's nothing but me manifesting in my Eightfold Prakriti. You know me, you just are not capable to grasp the totality of his expression. With that, he obviously progressed and said, well then let me explain to you that all these beings have come out of me. I am the source of all the beings and I am the resting place for all the beings.\n\nThere is nothing other than me in this world but in its manifestation, the Eightfold Prakriti. I don't see him in its totality. So therefore he proceeds further in verse seven to say how this thing is all. They're now connected with each other. Right now we don't feel connected to anything. No matter how hard we try, we feel like I am the island in this universe.\n\nBy myself, I am so unique. Everything else is the world. All beings are part of the world. That's what says Jagat. We complain in Hindi all the time, you know, Jagat T Vesahe. You know, because we consider ourselves to be so unique, we are not part of this, Jagat.\n\nWe are not part of this world. Even though our intellect says I am part of this world. But our heart doesn't say we are part of this world. We are outside of it. We are in the center of my universe. So this, when I see, I say I don't see connection.\n\nHow am I connected to the rest of the world? The verse 7 says there is nothing other than mat paratharam na anyat kashit asti dhananjaya. There is nothing exist other than me. So how can you exist without me? Because from that one singularity, the whole plurality came out. Everything in the part of the plurality is part of that.\n\nIf I am part of this world, I am part of that singularity. Therefore there is nothing other than me exist. You are no other than my own self. He said I am the common thread. The express in English is but that's the common thread. Common thread in all these things and beings which keeps them together as the world.\n\nMyself is a common thread. Even though right now I think myself is completely different than yourself and herself and his self and. But that self remains constant in all the beings we want. I am that common thread which keeps this universe together. As in the analogy obviously is the sutre manigana eva in the pearl necklace. Beads are all separate from each other.\n\nBut it keeps them together as a necklace thread in it. So I am that common thread. What is common in me and you, is it? You also call it your myself when you express yourself. So that self is, Bhagavan said, is the common thread among all the beings. And then obviously for people like us who can't really understand without giving a very elaborate, you know, examples.\n\nWe can only relate to something. When somebody gives an example about something which we know this may still remain abstract to us. But then say, okay, let me explain to you how it works. So the next verse you say, raso aham apsu kante prabhasmi shashushurya yoho pranavaha sarva vedeshu shabda k purushamdrusam. In other words, he said, now let me enumerate the things which you can understand and say, I am rasoham apsukam teya. I am the liquidity in water, and I am the radiance in moonkanish and sun.\n\nWhatever we think is the unique quality of that thing or a being, he said, that's because of me, because I reside in that being or a thing that makes the thing be who that is. That's when the Sanskrit is, what is dharma? That which holds is dharma. And as I used an example, dharma, sugar is sweet. As long as it is sweet, it is sugar. It may look like sugar, it may feel like sugar, but if it doesn't taste like sugar, it's not a sugar.\n\nSo the dharma of a thing or being, what makes thing or being what it is? Bhagavan says that dharma is me. Because of that dharma, things and beings are what they are. Then obviously, he continues, the next verses 9 and 10 says, Punyo Gandha prithevyam chatejast cha sushmi vibhav jivanam sarvabhu te su tapaschasmi tapas vishwa. I am that sweet fragrance of this earth. I'm the radiance in the fire and I'm the life in all being beings.\n\nVery clearly he says, I am the life in all beings. Tapas chasmi tapas visu. In other words, anything which make anybody what it is, is me. Living beings are living beings because of my presence in them. It's a profound statement which we all basically know. We have accepted that say bijammaam sarvabhutanam vidhi parsha sanatana.\n\nKnow that I am the source of all being. I am the sidh of all the beings. The beings cannot exist without me. Vidhim buddhir buddhimatamasmi. I am the intellect and intellectual. Brilliant in the brilliant.\n\nSo if I think that I am so smart, my ego said because of my intellect. Bhagavan says, Mr. Ego, you have really nothing to do with it. I am the intellect and the intellectual, and I am the brilliance and brilliant and Obviously. Balam Balavatamasmi Kama raga Vivarjitam. Here is very interesting point he makes. I think I am the strength in the strong, you know, or powerful.\n\nI am the power in the powerful. But Kama raga Vivarjitam, that strength is devoid of desire or attachment. It is strength without any association with desire. We only desire strength only if I can use it. Isn't there an expression says what is the use of power if I can abuse it? So this is the power without any desire to abuse it.\n\nThat's as we would call it, a sattvic strength. So Bhagavan said, I am the strength in the strong. But when that strong misuses that strength and hurts other, that's not me. So this is like, you know, very conveniently keeps out of, you know, all the trouble we get into, you know. Hey Bhagavan, if you're not giving this guy all this mighty power, he want to hurt us. Bhagavan says, I am the strength in him.\n\nBut I am not the one who is hurting you. Dharma Aviruddha, Bhuteshu Kamo Asmi Bharatarshapa. Now I say, okay, what happens to all these desires we have? He said, that's also me. But that is Dharma Aviruddha. We have always this argument.\n\nIs the desire good or bad? You know, Vedantic discussion. We say, yeah, but that's also our desire. I said, well, I want to do good thing. Well, that's also desire. Well, I want to meet Bhagavan.\n\nSo if you see in our tradition, this Brahmacharis, when they go to the guru, they first shave all their hair off. They become shaven head. That basically indicates you're getting rid of all your desires. You're a student now you're a seeker. You shouldn't have any other desire. But they leave a Choti that indicates his Sastravasana desire for knowledge.\n\nThat Choti keeps him tied to the Sastra. Then when he becomes a Sanyasi, when that Choti is gone, when you reach a level, even attachment to the Sastra should be dropped. Because otherwise I just remain a pure Pandit. That's an attachment. It's a golden chain, Bhagawan. So even that has to be dropped.\n\nSo when he becomes a Sanyasi, Sanyasi is literally renunciated. He has renounced everything, all attachment. So the Choti goes away. Even Sastra Vasana is not there. That also becomes another bondage. So he says even that Needs to go.\n\nSo where do these desires stand? Bhagwan said, desires are nothing, but me I am expressing through you as your desire. But that is Dharma, Avirudh Dharam. It is not contrary to your Dharma when you have a desire in accordance with your Dharma. I am a doctor and I have a desire to help people or perform surgery or practice my art of medicine. That's a Dharma of Yuddha desire.\n\nThat's not a desire which is wrong. Bhagavan said, I am desiring you, which is in line with your Dharma. If I'm a father and I want to take care of my children, that's in line with my Dharma. If I'm a teacher and I want to make sure my students learn, that's a desire in line with my Dharma. If I am a postman, I want to deliver mail that in line with my Dharma. So where we get confused in our understanding of Vedanta is Vedanta doesn't say, the desire is something outside of this world.\n\nWe import it somewhere. It's part of your nature, part of the Bhagavan's nature. But it has to be to your Dharma and without any contradiction to your Dharma. I'm a treasurer in a bank, but I want to become the owner of the bank dealing on the Malaya. That's obviously contrary to my position. So Bhagawan says, I am the strength in the strong, but having no attachment or a desire to use this strength in a contrary manner to my Dharma.\n\nTherefore, Bhagavan Bhagavad Gita asks Arjuna to fight. Well, is it right or wrong? Bhagavad says, it is in line with your Dharma. You are the general of this army. All these people are relying on you. You have to use your strength to fight your battle.\n\nSo very important point in this is desires are natural as long as they are in line with your duties. I want to take care of my children. That's in line with my Dharma. So say Eche, Eva, Sattvika, Bhava, Rajasa, Tama, Sasta e. Whatever beings are of the Sattvik, Rajasikhar, Thomasek. So we have to classify people into the Sattvic people, Rajasic people, Tamasic people, Rajasic things, Tamasic thing by its own nature. We know the or at least we have learned in Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita that this world is made up of these three Gunas, Sattvik, Rajasik and Tamasic.\n\nAnd everything else we See is the permutation and combination of these three gunas. When I have a four color printing, I may have hundreds of colors on my picture. But they are nothing but the permutation combination of the four colors. Therefore my printer will say yellow is out and I replace the yellow.",

      "commentary": "Unlike a car with its user's manual, we are born without instructions how to live. We experience life vicissitudes without a so called user's manual. The Gita has been described as such a guide. We are discussing Chapter 7, Vignana Vignana Yoga, the Yoga of Knowledge and Wisdom. And in this chapter we have seen that Lord says that you complain that I don't know the Lord. I have never seen God before.\n\nBut I pervade in this universe with my Astha DHA Prakriti. In my Eightfold nature, I manifest in this world. And you see me every day. And I say that Bhumiyapo anala kam vayuhu Manabuddhi Ahankar. That's my Eightfold Prakriti. And you see me every day.\n\nThis is my lower Prakriti. Lower means more grosser manifestation which you and I can perceive through our senses. But he said higher than that is my higher Prakriti, which is not just the sum total of all this, but something which is the cause for this entire universe. Everything comes out of me and everything goes back into me. It stays in time and space in a particular shape or a form or a state temporarily, but eventually it goes back to what its source is, which is the self, the self which is all pervading. Therefore there is nothing other than myself.\n\nAnything which you can see is nothing but myself. Therefore all the examples then given is whatever you see is me. In the last verse, in the previous three strands we have seen, it says Ech Eva Satvika Bhava Rajata Rajasa Tamasashchaye Mata Evetan Vidhi natuham teshutemayi. This world right now, it seems like is divided into three types of people, three types of things, three types of qualities. These are the qualities of my Maya. This illusion which creates this world of plurality when there is only one exist, the singularity exists is because of the illusion which fools my mind and intellect.\n\nWhere I see this plurality. And I say that this illusion which I see is because of my Devi Prakriti called Maya. This Maya has three aspects. Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. Sattva, the pure knowledge or existence. Rajas is the activity and Tamas is the inertia.\n\nThese three absolutely require for anything to exist. You know, the awareness that it exists, the activity, dynamism and then inertia, all three in a different proportions, in different permutation combination creates this world of plurality. So you see any being you see in this world, whether it is Sattvik, Rajasik or Tamasik, anything which you see, whether it is Sattvik, Rajasik or Tamasic, they come from me, they are in me, but I am not in them. So now obviously our whole life, you heard, the Bhagavan is in every being. Now Bhagavan says that they are in me, but I am not in them. And when we discussed this verse, we have said the analogy will be something as simple as the universal space says that I'm not in the car, but car is in me.\n\nCar traveling in space. The space inside the car, is it in the car or is it remaining where it is? And car is traveling in the space. But we feel the space in the car, otherwise we wouldn't be able to sit in it. However, the car moves from Hanover county to Hendricko, it doesn't carry the Hanover county space to Hendricko. Then Henrico will have surplus of space here.\n\nBecause the space remains where it is. Even though in my perception it seems like the space is in the car, in reality the car is in the space. So even though it seems like the Bhagavan is in me, that's why I can speak, I can hear, I can walk, but actually I am in the Lord. As long as I keep connected with Him, I can do all of that. So the next three verses which I say, Tripi guna. Verse 13 Mohitam Na Abhijana ti mame bhya param avyayam.\n\nAll this elaborate explanation creates a confusion in our mind and says, so if that's the case, why I don't feel Lord's presence? All this is great, but I don't feel. Because Bhagavan says this world is deluded by these three qualities of Maya. These three qualities of Maya is Tattva Rajasant Tamas which creates this magnificent projection of this world. We go to cinema, theater, we know it just a screen and this light is thrown on it. But we get caught into the images and the storyline and the acting.\n\nWe forget completely at the time that what's in front of us is nothing but a white screen in a light through the lens's projector on it, that magnificent projection. So it's even more confusing for us what is real and what is unreal. Up till now at least the 2D world, we can say that's a two dimensional. My world is three dimensional. Many, many, many years ago I went to Epcot center and there's the first time I've seen hologram. And I was completely baffled.\n\nThe lady looks so real in their hologram walking around giving presentation, you know. But luckily it was not a full scale. So you could see it as. But it's so real that our eyes cannot make our senses cannot differentiate between what is real and what is unreal. Same thing with the Photoshop. Previously somebody sends me a picture, I know what it is.\n\nNow somebody sends me a picture. I don't know whether it's Photoshop doctored picture or a real picture. I'm in a party, but I was never there because somebody photoshopped me into it. So the more the world creates these magnificent projections, more we get deluded. More our senses are involved in it, more it confuses us from differentiating the real from unreal. So Bhagavan said that these three qualities of mine, of my Prakriti projected through my Prakriti.\n\nMy prakriti nature of that is this divine Maya. The divine illusion which creates multiple entities out of one. This world is getting deluded by this Mom Na abhijanati Mami Bihaparam avyam. And therefore they do not know that I am the immutable source of all beings. It is as simple as this. Bhagavan said, it's me.\n\nI created the confusion in your mind. I am the source of the confusion. So we say, well then why are we suffering? Bhagavan, why didn't you not create any sort of simple world where everybody understand that we are the part of the Lord. But in fact that's Bhagavad. We don't like the simple thing More confusing it is.\n\nThat's why we want the 3D TV now. Up till now happy with 2D TV. I want to get a lot more that's more interesting. More baffling it is more interesting. It is in the magic which somebody can figure out. It is no more Magic and I don't want to go and see it.\n\nSomething which I can't figure out. How does this David Cooper film make the Statue of Liberty vanishes? Whole United States tune into the television set. More confusing, more interesting. That's what makes our life interesting. Bhagwan said, that's what my Leela is.\n\nWe get caught into the play, we lose the sense of what is real and what is unreal. So the next verse is Devihi isa gunamayi Mama Maya dratyaya Devihi Esha. This divine Maya of mine. Maya is divine because after all, it is the Lord's quality. He says, this is my quality. But he says it is very difficult to overcome.\n\nWe know when we go to see the magic show, almost 100% of the people in the audience know that there is no real magic. He is not cutting this lady into half. But at the same token, we can figure out how did he do it. We actually had a magic show at Chinma Mission. Probably you may have seen this. It was a fundraising and they obviously all these act.\n\nBut the one act was they will put the Swamiji, Swami Dheerananda into this box and they rotate the box around. And then when you open, the Swamiji is gone and a young little kid with the swami dress is coming out. So, oh, what did you do? You made Swamiji a little kid. Unfortunately, what happened is obviously there are two compartments. The guy switches around.\n\nBut you know, Swamiji's little saffron rope gets stuck into that little. So when the little kid comes out, we see the Swamiji and little saffron robe and that the whole magic is gone. You know, everybody's laughing now. We figured out Swamiji is right behind that curtain, you know, so this magic is only enjoyable as long as we can figure it out. Once we figured it out, the magic is all gone. The Bhagavan says, I am the greatest magician, so you can't figure out my Maya.\n\nThis three fold Maya of mine is difficult to overcome. Simple mind and intellectual. You're trying to figure out the Lord's Maya. Your mind and intellect are not capable. Bhagavan says you can try all your life, generations after generations, intellectually figure out what the Lord's nature is. You're not going to succeed.\n\nBhagawan says, mama Maya Duratya. It is very difficult to cross over but then we say, okay, that's the end of this class. Let's close the book. Let's go home, you know? Ma meante mama mayam etam taranthite. Those who take refuge in me will cross over.\n\nThis Maya, we are all very anxious to find out. Well, the magician says, if you come and take, become my disciple, then you will figure out everything what I do. So when you go to the source and take refuge in him, if I really want to find out what David Copperfield does, I have to go and bow down and say, take me as your disciple. Let me know how you make this statue of Liberty vanishes. That's the purpose of my life. Okay, then I'll teach you.\n\nBhagavan says, mama maya dratya. It's very difficult to cross over if you just rely on your own intellect and your mind. But if you take refuge in me, in other words, starts identifying with the self, you will overcome that. That's the little escape hatch you have, you see. Ma meante those who invoke me or bhajanti mehenda. So we basically think about the one who sings Bhajan, Swami Dheerananda.\n\nIt's not the harmonium and tabla and all that, you know, Bhajanti Neel can't do bhajanti. Bhajanti means anytime we have to do something, we have to invoke ourselves. So when somebody asked me, say, neel, how did you do this? I did it all by myself. I had to invoke myself to do it. There is some other thing you will say, well, no, I didn't do a little help from this organization, but I still did it myself.\n\nSo I invoked the organization for some help, but I still myself is doing it. But she did it herself or something else. Well, they didn't do it, but he did it himself. Wherever there is something doing comes, there is some self involved in it. Whether it is myself, yourself, herself, themselves, itself, the self involved in it. In other words, in any activity you have to invoke self.\n\nThat self is the doer, whether it is myself or yourself or herself or himself. The self is the only doer. If there is no self involved, there is nothing happening. So we have to invoke the self. Now, when we invoke the self, it is with what instrument we invoke him. So if we Say, to get the light in this room I have to invoke electricity.\n\nSo I have to connect whatever the switch, connect that to the all the lights here and the lights come out.",
      "reflection": "Today, practice seeing the sacred in the ordinary. That person who annoyed you? A form of the divine. That sunset that took your breath away? The same. Can you hold both truths simultaneously?\n\nWhat would change if you moved through your day knowing that everything you encounter is, in its essence, a manifestation of the one divine reality? The Gita teaches that the Lord pervades all things—not as a poetic metaphor, but as literal truth.\n\nNotice where you draw lines between sacred and secular in your life. What would happen if those lines dissolved?"

      "commentary": "We have been discussing chapter seven, Inan Vignan Yoga Yoga of Knowledge and Wisdom. So, as we have discussed in chapter six, we have learned how to meditate. In chapter seven, he is teaching us what to meditate upon. In chapter six, we have learned how to identify with the Supreme Self and detach yourself from the limited self that I consider myself. In chapter seven, Bhagavan is giving us the indications of how to think about the Supreme Being. We have seen his lower and higher nature.\n\nThe lower nature is what I can see, perceive, think. In this world is the lower Prakriti. So Bhagavan said, he is all pervading and anything which I see, I should see his presence in it. Anything which I consider not conducive or conducive is still manifestation of the same underlying reality that this Prakriti has three Gunas, Sattva, Rajasant, Tamas. See, whatever, whichever it is, whatever there is which is Sattvik, Rajasik or Tamasik. Consider that all come from me, the supreme reality.\n\nIt is actually my mind which divide this world into three different categories. The world which I see as Sattvik, world which I see as Rajasic, world which I see as Tamasic. That makes me think about positive emotions where I feel happy, I feel that's a Sattvic world. The world which makes me agitated, I consider that world is Rajasik. The world which confuses me is the world is tamasic for me. But once in no matter what world you are identifying with, that is your world and you are in the center of it.\n\nBut consider that comes from me. All sense objects in this world, whether they give you Sattvic experience, rajasic experience or Tamasic experience, they all come from me. But I am not in them, they are in me. In other words, there is no indication of supreme reality in them. I cannot find its presence in them in those sense objects. But note that all sense objects are in me.\n\nIn other words, without that supreme reality, without my consciousness, I will not be able to detect any of those sense objects. Therefore, all the sense objects in this world are actually in my consciousness. Consider that they are all present because of my presence as your own consciousness. Then Bhagawan explains why we cannot say that. Because all people, all beings in this world are confused by this Maya. As we have discussed, Maya is that which is not, but appears to be.\n\nThat the world of sense objects are actually created by my own mind. The impression I have of the world of sense objects is actually my impression only. I will never know what the reality is. When I look up into the sky, I see stars and moon and sun. What I see is my world. What I see, the impression that I see is the representation of this world in my mind.\n\nI will never know what the reality is. So Bhagawan said, consider all that to be me. But you will never be able to cross this illusion that you have created about your world. This knowledge about this underlying reality is lost to me because I'm under the spell of this Maya. I do not see this unity in diversity of the sense objects around me. Because I consider myself to the island by myself.\n\nI am so unique that I'm different than this world. This notion about my uniqueness creates this duality about I and the world. Because that's the my illusion that the Maya's illusion. Knowing fully well through my intellectual appreciation. Then my body, my mind, my intellect are part of this Prakriti. This body is nothing but the food modified.\n\nBut I never see my body as food modified. I always see my body as something very unique. Bhagwan said, that's the confusion created by Maya. Tribhi, Gunamaya, Bhavai, Bhi Sarvam, Idam, Jagat Mohitam, the entire Jagat. All, all beings are confused by the three Gunas. But those who have some inkling about this underlying reality, they will pursue that reality.\n\nThat's basically I'm worshipping. I'm trying to find out and identify with the supreme self. I have inkling that there is something higher than me and that I am pursuing. So Bhagavan now tells us which type of a person will try to identify with their supreme self. In last verse, which we discussed, he said, who will not be aware of the existence of something greater than his own self? He said, Namam Duskruti, Noamudaha Prapadyanti Naradamaha, Maya Aprudgana, Asuram Bhava Masritaha Those who are under the complete spell of Maya, they will only identify with this ignorance that they have.\n\nThis ignorance that I am by myself and the world is a complete different entity. Duskrutina Mudha the people who are not yet evolved to a point to identify themselves with something higher than their limited self. He said they will not be able to understand this and therefore they will take refuge in their own ignorance. In their own ignorance that I am who I am, the world is out there to get me. In contrast to that, Bhagavan said there are people who have evolved from the stage of identifying with their limited self and have recognized that there is an underlying unity in all sense. Objects which I see, they are strung into the same reality.\n\nObviously, physics tell us the same thing, that in this world there is one underlying energy. And in this world nothing is lost. No matter what incident or which phenomenon is happening, we know that energy in this world remains constant. If you take a gallon of water and boil it to a point which all evaporates, that does not mean that the water is lost. The same amount of energy which was in the water, the mass is now converted into something else. When you add all that up, it will come exactly the same amount.\n\nThat's what we learned in high school physics. The Bhagawan said that you in this world there is nothing is really lost or gained. It just changes appearances. And those who have come to the realization that there is an underlying reality, they will pursue identification with that reality. And those people who go on and say that Chatur Vida Bhajante maam janaha sukrutino Arjunah. Contrast with the last verse.\n\nPeople who are wrong doers, wrongdoers, in essence they are acting in this world with the wrong notion that their own self is the only reality. Charvak darshan, basmi Bhutasha punara gaman kutaha. When this body is burnt, there is no coming back. So this life is the only life. And enjoy as best as you can, no matter what you have to do. Runam kutva ghrutum pibet.\n\nThose are duskritina because they have a very narrow view about who they are. And therefore their actions are also driven by that paradigm. That paradigm that I am by myself and have to make the most out of this life. Bhagavan calls them Maya Prudgana. Their knowledge about their self and their connection with the higher self is lost because of confusion created by Maya. Chatur Vidha Bhajanti Maam Janaha Sukratina Arjunaha Contrast to the people who are good doers, the people who are of good deeds, they pursue me.\n\nThey try to identify with me in four different ways. Or you can say the four different types of people who identify with me. Now this can be one person in a four different states of pursuing the supreme reality. Arthaha, Jignasuhu, Artharthi, Gnani, Chabharatarshapa, Osayno, Bharat clan. There are of four types. One is Arthah with the one who is in distress and looking for help.\n\nBut there is a slight distinction people have made in understanding this verse. Bhagavan has called them Sukrutina. Also in the next two verses he will attach the word udara to them. The noble people who who are trying to understand why things are the way they are in this world. So we have seen that people who are working for themselves, all actions are binding to them. Any action which is binding to me is dusk.\n\nAny action which is liberating me is sukruta. So in last words, people were wrongdoers. All their actions were binding. They get more and more deeper into this bondage of their egos. In contrast, these people are so krutina. All their actions are towards liberation from their identification.\n\nSo this Aaatha may not be an average person who is in distress is and seeking Bhagavan's help. I'm in trouble and help me. I have back pain, please help me. He's trying to why there is distress in this world, why people are suffering in this world. And he's seeking Lord's help, guidance how to alleviate people from their suffering. So during pandemic time, a person may be very safe in his house and he's in a location where he's not going to get infected.\n\nBut just watching people suffering in the world, you may think, oh Lord, why are you not removing all this suffering from this world and help people who are suffering from this pandemic? Bhagavan said, that's the Artha. There is one Bhakta who is pursuing me, is disturbed by the distress, seeking understanding. The next was Jignaso, the Jignasu. He wants to know how this world works, why there is suffering in this world. It may be at my own personal level that when I'm in distress, I'm trying to find out why there is sorrow in my life.\n\nWhat is it that I'm not doing right, which makes me sorrowful. But at a greater level, the Bhakta is trying to understand why there is sorrow, why people are suffering in this world is trying to find the answer. Bhagavan Buddha he was not upset about his own situation. He was well protected in the palace, but he saw the suffering outside. He said, I need to find the cause for this suffering. Bhagawan said, that's a jignasu.\n\nThen third one Bhagawan said, Artharti, one who is seeking wealth. So we all fall into that category. We do Lakshmi Puja on Diwali Day because I want to make sure the next year will be as good or better than the last year. But this Arthur, is not just for me. But these people are seeking wealth so that they can help others. So these are Arthartic.\n\nThey want to create wealth for the betterment of the society so that the sorrows can be eliminated from the society. And the last one is the Gnani who has truly understood the relationship between his limited self and the greater self. Because he understand the relationship between his limited self and the Supreme Self. Bhagavan in the next verse says that he is better. Sachamama Priya out of these four devotees, they are selfless workers. They have gone through first six chapters of Bhagavad Gita, have learned the art of Karma Yoga.\n\nThey're working in this world outside for greater good. But still they have questions about why there is suffering, where the suffering is coming from. What can I do to alleviate the suffering? Oh Lord, give enough so everyone can eat and nobody goes hungry. But the Gnani understands that his own limited self is none other than the Supreme Self. The Supreme Self and his own Self are one and the same.\n\nThey're connected with each other. And they're only separated by the conditioning Nitya Yukta constantly establishing their knowledge. Then no matter what I see outside, the Self is pervading all throughout this world. Whether people are suffering or people are enjoying, but it is the same reality which is expressing itself. Ek Bhakta Viseshyade is single, pointedly identified with that because there is nothing else that he can identify with. Once he has realized that myself is not different than the Supreme Self.",
      "reflection": "Today, practice seeing the sacred in the ordinary. That person who annoyed you? A form of the divine. That sunset that took your breath away? The same.

      "commentary": "We have been discussing chapter seven, Gnana Vignan Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge and Wisdom. We have seen in Bhagavad Gita so far that Bhagavan taught us Gnana Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge or Path of Knowledge. In chapter two, Sankhya Yoga, we learned that our self is is immortal, imperishable or we consider ourselves to be mortal. So that was the path of Knowledge revealing the nature of the self. Then from chapter three to five we learned Karma Yoga, Path of Action, how we can transform our day to day action into selfless activities and purify our mind and intellect. So the Karma Yoga is to develop equanimity and purification of the mind.\n\nThat's Path of Action. And in chapter six, Bhagavan taught us Dhyana Yoga, Yoga of Meditation, how we can shift our mind from identifying with this limited self that I consider myself, this body, this mind, this intellect that I consider to be my own self. In chapter two we learned that the all pervading Self, Almighty, all pervading, omniscient, ever existing Self which is of the nature of Satchit and Ananda, is nothing but my own self as the universal Self. What I consider myself right now is the conditioned consciousness. That same consciousness were conditioned by this conditionings I call body, mind and intellect. So we learned how to shift this identification from this limited self to the Higher self through Dhyana Yuga Yoga of Meditation, focusing my mind on that supreme Self.\n\nAt the end of chapter six, Bhagavan made a declaration that Yogi, one who has tuned his mind to the Supreme Self, in other words, one who has shifted his identification from this limited self to the Higher Self, is greater than Tapasvi, one who is practicing austerities. He is also greater than jñānī, one who has acquired knowledge about the supreme through the study of Scriptures, Vedas and Upanishads and all other scriptures. And finally, Bhagavan says he is greater than Karmi, the one who is acting in this world. And he only thinks that doing good is good enough. The Bhagavan clarified that doing good is not good enough. You have to have this clear understanding that myself is not this limited self.\n\nBut the limited self is nothing but the expression of the Supreme Self. The three paths which are described in our system, those of Karma Yoga, Gnana Yoga and Bhakti Yoga, they need to be practiced serially. Therefore, the Gita starts with Karma Yoga. Now in chapter seven, Bhagavan is instructing us how to practice Path of Bhakti, the path of devotion. But before I can start practicing Bhakti Yoga, I have to develop that identification with that supreme Self. Without knowing that supreme Self, I will not be able to focus my limited mind, which is right now fully identified with this limited self, onto that supreme self which is limitless.\n\nSo Bhagavan in the opening of this chapter gives Arjuna assurance that I will teach you. I will tell you how to do that. Bhagavan opens the chapter by saying Yogam Injan Mat Asraya, tune your mind to me. My mind right now is fully tuned with this body. Identify the limited self. That mind has to now identify with the Supreme Self.\n\nHe said, once you do that, you will come to know me. And then he also assured us that he will teach us both the knowledge and its application. I will tell you the Gnanam, the Knowledge and Vignana Visishta Gnanam, its application in your life without leaving anything behind. Having known that, you will not have to know anything else. In other words, having known myself in its true nature, there will not be any need for me to achieve, accomplish or acquire to find that ultimate happiness, that happiness which I'm seeking, which has no limitation. I do not want to be unhappy at any given time.\n\nIf you ask me when do you want to be happy? It is not okay for me to be happy during the weekdays, but unhappy during weekends. I want to be happy all seven days of the week and 365 days of the year. Bhagwan says, having known that knowledge that yourself is not the limited self, you shall achieve that ultimate happiness. Why people are not achieving this knowledge? He said, manushyanam, out of three thousands of human beings on this planet, someone will try to achieve this perfection.\n\nWe can now say billions of people out of billions of people. Very few will try this method of achieving perfect happiness by identifying with that Supreme. And he says, those who are striving, there are very few are striving. Out of billions of people, maybe few hundred or few dozens are Trying this. And he says out of them, yata, tamashcha, Siddhanam, kaschimat, Mam, viddhi, tattvatah and even those who are striving sincerely. Only very few will achieve this perfection.\n\nSo this almost looks like Bhagavan is discouraging us. But Bhagavan is not discouraging us. Bhagavan is saying that it is an equal opportunity goal. Anyone can achieve this goal if they try in an appropriate manner. So Bhagavan then describes the people who are striving to achieve identification with the Supreme Self. He calls them my devotees, my Bhakti.\n\nAnd he classifies those devotees into four categories. In general, he divided the entire human race into two categories. One, those who are striving for perfection. Those who are not striving for perfection. Those who are striving for perfection are trying to develop some kind of relationship with the Supreme. Others are simply considering that this world is where I can find my happiness.\n\nI work outside, I go and acquire things, I go and accomplish things and that will give me happiness. A group of people who are not even trying to develop any relationship with the Supreme. He called them Duskritina does not mean they are evildoers. But they are working towards their happiness in a wrong way which will guarantee their failure. He defines the other group as Sukrutina, those people of good deeds. He says they are my devotees.\n\nBut they fall into four different categories. Therefore not all of them are going to achieve perfection. The first one is artharthi. One who is identifying or reaching out to the Supreme. Developing some relationship with him due to distress that there is sorrow in his life or her life or there is sorrow just all around Him. And therefore he wants to know how invoking the God's grace will alleviate that sorrow.\n\nWe'll only invoke his grace when we feel helpless. I know I can solve my problem. It's only when we feel helpless. Then we'll seek help from the Higher self. They are my devotees, but they have limited relationship. They only seek my help when they feel helpless.\n\nIt's like my son when he was in college. He will only call me when he really needs something. Otherwise he is happy doing whatever he was doing. Then we have to call him and say Bhai, you didn't call us all throughout the month. But when he needs something he will suddenly remember that my parents are there to take care of me. Let me call my dad and the dad send me some more money.\n\nSo that relationship is still of a Son and a father. My Father in heaven will take care of me when I really need him. The other one is jignasu. One who is curious about the nature of the Supreme. All the scientists actually fall in that category. Because they're trying to find that God equation.\n\nThat equation which will reveal what is the nature of the Creator who created this universe. So that's out of the curiosity to know the nature of the self, nature of the supreme, nature of the ultimate reality. They are developing relationship with him. Then the third Bhagavan says, artharthi, the entire wealth on this planet or in this universe is created by the Supreme Being. And therefore he is the owner. So when I need wealth to support myself, to support my family, to support my community, support my nation, I seek his health.\n\nOn our dollar bill it says, in God we trust. And I'm seeking this wealth. So that Bhakta is an Artharti. And the last one, he said, is jñānī. One who has developed this relationship with the supreme by understanding the real nature of the Supreme. Shifting his identification from the limited self to the higher self.\n\nThat the higher self is my true self. This limited self is just the reflection of that self. So Bhagavan said that jñānī is the one who is closest to me. So Bhagavan said, Udaraha Sarvaeve tatra Gnanitvam Eva Mehmatam. All my devotees are noble people. They're people who are doing good deeds.\n\nThey are on a right path. I may start developing relationship with Bhagavan because I feel distressed. But eventually I will progress in the path where I'll understand his true nature. It's like we know somebody. Just by knowing a little bit about that person, we start liking him more. Closer we come to that person, we will know that person more in detail.\n\nThen ultimately we'll know that person almost in totality. So Bhagawan said, all these devotees of mine are noble people. However, jñānī I consider to be my own self. He is no different than me. Asthita Sahiyuktaatma Mama Eva Anuttamam Gatim. By establishing steadfastly his mind in me, he comes to me.\n\nBut then he says something which discourages many of us. bahūnām janmanām ante jñānavān māmprapadyate Vasudevah sarvam iti samātmā sudurlabhā. But this jñānī has not become jñānī overnight. After going through this journey of knowing the Supreme Self for many, many, many lives. He comes to understand the nature of the Supreme. And he realizes that there is nothing in this universe.\n\nThere is nothing in this prakṛiti which is other than Vasudeva. Vasudeva, the supreme, all pervading Self. So Bhagavan said, I told you in the beginning that the prakṛiti is my lower nature. The prakṛiti is my manifest nature which one can experience through senses. I can see, I can touch, I can feel. But other than this manifest nature of mind, there is higher nature which is unmanifest which you to experience.\n\nAnd then only you will come to know. So after many, many births of trying to seek unity in this diversity. Such a jñānī, such a person achieves that understanding that there is nothing but that supreme self is everywhere. Sab Mahatma sudurlabhā. Such a great soul is very rare to find. So we come to the conclusion that this is not something which I can achieve.\n\nBut come to think of it, there's nothing in this life we achieve in any other way. We have to start somewhere and then gradually make progress one step at a time. We have learned that in elementary school somebody asked me, what do you want to become? I want to become a doctor. It does not make you become doctor the next day. It took you a long time.\n\nFrom elementary school to secondary school to high school to college, then medical school, then internship. All that effort you put for many, many, many years. And then you achieved this status as doctor. Such and such people recognize you as doctor. You practice your art of medicine. All that is only possible because of the journey you started from your kindergarten which ended into your internship in some hospital.\n\nBhagavan says bahūnām janmanāmante, the jñānī which you see today. As a knowledgeable person. He did not achieve the knowledge overnight. He put his efforts into it. So Bhagawan is encouraging us. No matter where we are in our journey, we keep making progress one step at a time.\n\nBut then the caution here is we may get distracted.",
      "reflection": "Today, practice seeing the sacred in the ordinary. That person who annoyed you? A form of the divine. That sunset that took your breath away? The same. Can you hold both truths simultaneously?\n\nWhat would change if you moved through your day knowing that everything you encounter is, in its essence, a manifestation of the one divine reality? The Gita teaches that the Lord pervades all things—not as a poetic metaphor, but as literal truth.\n\nNotice where you draw lines between sacred and secular in your life. What would happen if those lines dissolved?"

      "commentary": "Unlike a car with its user's manual, we are born without instructions how to live. We experience life vicissitudes without a so called user's manual. The Gita has been described as such a guide. We have been discussing chapter seven, the Knowledge and Wisdom. And we have seen that Bhagavan said that consciously or unconsciously, we are all seeking the Lord. We are all seeking who we are, where we came from.\n\nBut some of us seek unconsciously and some of us seek consciously. Those who feel unconsciously, obviously they do not know where the answer is. Those who say consciously, they are worshipping the Lord, that which makes the source of my being. And we have seen they can be classified in four out of this four. The Gnani is so firm in his conviction that his self is something other than this limited self. We need to find out what that is.\n\nBut the journey from the ignorance about the self to the self takes its own efforts. Bahunam Janmanam ante Gnanavaan Maamrapadhyate. After many years of sincere seeking the Gnani who is sincerely seeking his own self, he finds the truth. And then he comes to the conclusion that Vasudha Deva Sarvamiti there is nothing other than the reality. Supreme reality exists. There is no world and there is no I.\n\nAll that exists is Vasudevas. Anything that I see, touch, feel, perceive is nothing but that one supreme reality alone. But he said, why we don't all fail? Because Kamehi taihi taihi rhtagna. Because of this desire and that desire, that knowledge which is inherently ours, we feel who we are, but that is taken away from us by this desire or that desire. And therefore now we seek the fulfiller of that desire.\n\nWho do I go and meet and say hello to him in a party? One who I think is going to be the most beneficial to me. Networking parties, I'm talking about, that's where we go. Somebody may be coming very Lovingly and say Neil, I said no, no, no, not right now. I need to go and talk to that guy because that's what I think my benefits are. I need to talk to them.\n\nEven in a social party, somebody whom we think is most important, we go and say hello to him first. See, with that desire and this desire our sense of who we are is looted away. And then we seek that fulfiller of that desire. That's the Devata who we consider the fulfill. Our divine desire is the Devata. We worship those Devata.\n\nAnd Bhagavan says whatever your desire and whoever your Devata eventually comes from me alone. So Bhagavan said that whatever you have faith in that, that entity, that source will fulfill my desire. I make your faith even firmer. Because where does the faith come? Faith come from my own attachment and understanding, my own consciousness, my own thinking is only possible because this supreme functions through me as consciousness. Same consciousness which allows me to think makes me think over and over again in the same line of thinking.\n\nAnd it makes my faith firmer and firmer. More I think in that line. So I say only science can give me the answer. More I indulge into that thought. More my faith become firmer. All these people are nonsense.\n\nAll these sadhus and Swamis. Swamiji himself said that's how he started. These guys are just bluffing away their way. So more and more we think in the same line. The same faith becomes firmer by our own consciousness. Bhagawan says, I make their fame firm.\n\nAnd then I said more. They, you know, worship that Devta. They fulfill that desire sincerely. Whenever I apply myself in whatever field, the success comes from that field. Sister Bhagavan said, wherever you with your faith apply yourself. Your desires will be fulfilled.\n\nHowever, he said all that comes from me alone. Sataya Srdhaya, Yuktah Tasya Aradhanam Ihate Lavatecha Tathah Kaman Maya Eva Vithaan Hitan. No matter where you think this prophet came to you, where you think this success came to you. No matter who you think helped you, Bhagavan said that was your faith that would make you think that it came from this. However, because I am the all pervading Lord. Everything that is coming to you from these different Devatas are coming from me alone.\n\nI am the only source. Those who are in business, you have several different accounts and LLCs. And then you transfer this money from that and that money from that. Eventually whose money that is your. Anytime we go out and do something. And Mina said, so how are you going to pay for this thing?\n\nI said, oh, that's for nbjs. She thinks the money coming from nbj who is paying the rent here. Then I don't have to worry about it. As long as you don't think this is coming from me. But eventually it all comes from me, right? But I feel at the time that it didn't come from the Lord.\n\nIt came from this Devta, this source. Bhagavan says all the sources eventually merges into me. So wherever you are, whatever the devta you are worshiping, wherever the results are coming, they all come from me. You apply yourself into a field, into that productive potential and you shall get the results. But know that all these results come from me. Antavattu phalam te sam tat Bhavati alba medhasam.\n\nBut this Alpa mehda sam, the one with the limited intellect, they get the finite results. Antavattu which is an end. No matter how much hard I try for something and get it, the joy will only last for a certain period of time. My standard example of buying a BMW. You bought the BMW and that has ended. Pursuit has its own charm.\n\nOnce you achieve that, when you reach the journey, the destination, the whole excitement of the journey has ended. They said, whatever these devatas you are worshipping, certainly you will get the success in that field. But the results you are getting are finite. It has its beginning and the end. I want to go and see a Broadway show I have never seen ever in my life. So next time I'm in New York, I want to see it.\n\nBut it has a beginning and the end. You go in the beginning. So show starts and so ends. After that I'm back to square one. So Bhagawan said, these people with the limited intellect thinks that their destination in this infinite happiness is. Therefore they pursue this field of finite happiness and they get it.\n\nDivan Diva jo Deviya jo Yanti Mad Bhakta Yanti Mamapi. One who is seeking for the small gains get small gains. One who wants to hit a jackpot, it strives for that and reaches there sooner or later. So Bhagavan said, devatas, the bhaktas of the Devatas which all of us, we have this desire and that. So we continuously pursue that. And because we put our Efforts, we get that.\n\nBut Bhagavan says the one who seeks me, he finds me as simple as that. Gandhiji could have been the most successful barrister in South Africa and could have made all this money like all the other Gujaratis made at the time, you know. But he wasn't happy with that finite result. We would have never heard about Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi ever. His successful barrister practiced in Durban and died. We wouldn't have nothing to do with him.\n\nBut he wasn't going after the small results. He was going after what he thought rightfully belongs to his countrymen. So he became immortal. He got what he sought after. That's why I say be careful in what you think you want. You have this unlimited potential of realizing yourself.\n\nBut we are happy with gaining the small results in our life. And even in Sadhanas they said when you start meditating, those siddhis come to you. Then you are pretty happy with it. Good example is Yoga. In this country the Yoga is only for the physical. Patanjali didn't write Yoga to make your body just, you know, fit.\n\nHe wrote it to achieve the highest. But we are pretty happy with the little results we get. And therefore Bhagawan says they just have a limited intellect in thinking where their happiness lies. And therefore they are pursuing those field of actions, those field of potential gain and they get it. But that has a beginning and the end. Inherently we are seeking for infinite happiness but we are applying into a very small finite fields of actions and expecting it to get the infinite happiness.\n\nAnd therefore we are going from sorrow and happiness and sorrow and happiness. Sorrow and happiness. Mad Bhakta Yanti Mamapi Only my worshipper. In other words, the one who has decided that these small gains are not good enough for me. I need to find the ultimate truth which gives me infinite happiness. The last words say Avyaktam Vyaktim Apanam Manyah Abudheha.\n\nOne who has no intellect to understand what is the truth which all of us, we have no capacity to understand. Because the intellect is the only instrument we use to understand things. Intellect is a byproduct of ignorance. Ignorance creates who this perception of this limited being is me. This Me which is the body, mind and intellect is a product of Avidya. The ignorance that ignorance creates.\n\nThis mind is me, this intellect is me. That intellect is now trying to find out who the Lord is. I'm going to figure out because I'm going to reading Bhagavad Gita, then I'm going to open his heart. Then I also did Bible and then Quran. And in the end I'll tell you who the Lord is. He said, those Abdaya, they think that Avyakta.\n\nThey think that Avyakt is unmanifest. The Lord is pervading everywhere. But we can't really see Him. He is the substratum. Without this, this universe cannot exist. But he is not perceptible.\n\nI come to think that he manifests. And therefore we have all these Bhajans about Bhagavan. Mene apku de khane Bhagavan. And then we have stories about the Bhagavan came. If Bhagavan can come and stand in front of me and I am also standing here and the rest of the world also standing. Where is that unmanifest?\n\nTherefore he said, only the one without that understanding that unmanifest can never manifest. Unmanifest remain unmanifest. But I am seeking that. Therefore I say, oh no, this is Bhagavan. I think one of this Bal Vihar child. He has probably seen in his house the pictures of Swamis.\n\nSo when Swami Dheeranda was here, they came to our house and then went back to and said, mom, the God had come to Meenanti's house. Because to the little child Swami wearing a saffron robe is God. The picture he has seen is Bhagavan. God had come to Meenanti's house. So what does Mama say? Mama said, no, no, that's not God.\n\nThat's Swami Derananda. 4 the child, the God who is unmanifested manifested. Mother said, no, no, that's just Dheerananda. Us in our small intellect think that God manifests as Jesus, as Krishna. As this Bhagwan said, I remain unmanifest all the time. So I say, param Bhavam ajanantah mum avyam anuttamam.\n\nKnowing a guru, knowing a prophet and think, this is it. Swamiji said, then if that's the case, whoever ever went to temple and saw Murthy, he never had to find any truth. He found the Bhagavan or anybody who found a guru, he never had to do anything. He already found the truth. He said, no, they are just indications. Unmanifest remain unmanifest.\n\nIn this limited senses, mind and intellect have no capacity ever to understand it.",

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter seven, Gnana Vignana Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge and Wisdom. Knowledge about the Supreme Self, contemplating on which we can get the wisdom. So in this chapter we have seen from verses 4 through 7, Bhagavan gave a thumbnail sketch of who the Lord is, what to meditate upon. So first thing he said is, my manifest Prakriti is Eightfold, which is available to you for perception through your senses, which includes everything that we can think of, everything we can see, everything we can touch, everything we can feel, and everything we can think. So all body, mind and intellect experiences the all three worlds of our body, mind and intellect are part of his manifested Prakriti. But then he said that other than this is my Higher Prakriti.\n\nIn other words, that which is not available to you for cognition through your senses. Therefore it's called unmanifest because not available to us. Thinking through my mind, thinking through my intellect, or perceiving through my senses, it's not available. And therefore I say that's a higher Prakriti. Lower is which I can interact with. Higher I cannot perceive.\n\nBut that higher is the basis of all the manifest manifestation, without which the world which you and I know will not exist. If I'm not conscious about my world, does the world exist? It only exists because I'm aware of it. The known only exists when the Knower is there. So because the Knower is there, the world of known things and beings exist. So therefore Bhagavan said, my Higher Prakriti is the one which is stringing all these manifestations together.\n\nWhat you perceive, what I perceive, what he perceives, what she perceives. When you put all perception together, it is a world of our beings. That's my real nature. So we have seen from verse 4 through 7 the identity of the Lord, the Supreme, the our Self and how to contemplate on it. And then we have seen. Bhagavan said that you can perceive that through anything, which is the essence of anything.\n\nBrilliance in brilliant Swamiji used to say I am kick in whiskey. What is whiskey if there is no kick in it? It may look like whiskey, it may taste like whiskey. But if there is no cake in it, it's not a whiskey. That which makes thing and beings what it is, is who I am for one. Then he said that the people who have no discriminating intellect to pursue this will never pursue this, never would like to think about it.\n\nBut there are people who who are pursuing to understand the very nature of the self and to get over their limitations. We have seen there are four types of devotees. Arthaha, Jyugnasu, Vartarthi and Gnani. The Gnani is very close to me. He has come close to understanding, realizing what the self is all about. To Arjuna, therefore become a Gnani.\n\nTherefore pursue the path of knowledge which makes you realize who you are. And then he also said that in our delusion we sometimes think that the unmanifested come to manifest. See, Unmanifest never manifest. But we feel it has manifested. Bhagavan Vedvyas make this point very clear here. Because we have all this fighting about different religions.\n\nBecause we say that our Bhagavan has manifested as Krishna. Yours manifested is Christ, but mine is greater than yours. Because the very first ignorance about unmanifest comes into manifest. Unmanifest will never come into manifestation who has not used his intellect. Every religion says God is omnipresent. God is omniscient, God is omnipotent.\n\nThen how can your God be different than mine? If my God is omnipresent, there is no room for other God in me. Knowing which we will be fighting about. My God is greater than yours. Because Buddh Dayaha without using my intellect, I think that the God which is unmanifest come into manifestation as incarnation, as a prophet, as a sage. Param Bhavam Ajanantah.\n\nThey are not aware of my real nature. My real nature is Avyayayam immutable. That Bhagavan who created this world out of his own self because he has no other material available to him. Did he ever mutated into this world? He never mutated into this world. Therefore he said, one who does not know by nature is immutable.\n\nHe is the only one who is fighting about it. There is nothing higher than that. There is nothing beyond his existence. If you Take him out, nothing remains. If you put everything together, then nothing but him alone. But see, that's not available to all of us.\n\nTo perceive my own self is what I'm trying to understand. How can it be that difficult? It is difficult because Na aham Prakasaha Sarvasya Yogamaya samabrtaha. I am not available to awe because my real nature is veiled by the Yoga Maya. This Yoga Maya which creates this world of plurality out of these three gunas confuses so we can't see his real nature. Muda ayam na abhijanati Loko Maam Ajam avyam.\n\nDeluded by that Yoga Maya, I do not recognize its very nature which is unborn and immutable. That for our whole problem starts with our sorrows and limitations. So this Yoga Maya is the power with which he created this universe. This perception of plurality is because of this Yoga Maya. It is something like when I'm dreaming out of my own mental power, I create my own world and delude myself. I create my own world, but I remain I the waker remains immutable in that dream I remain unchanged.\n\nI remain ajaha in my dream. I never take birth as Bill Gates, but I feel like in my dream that I'm Bill Gates. So he said that is not available to all. Nobody will ever know it. It's not a statement which is to discourage us. It is a statement for us to contemplate on it.\n\nSo he said it is available to those who contemplate in my real nature and cross over. This Maya sees beyond this, therefore the word divyadraste. I have one perspective about this world right now. And then I can change my perspective when I get a greater knowledge. Before I came to Richmond, I had one perspective. I thought, oh, Richmond is a very conservative southern town.\n\nSo it's an old boy network type of a town. It almost seemed like so far away in south from Washington D.C. where I used to live, it's only 100 miles. But I thought it's all way down in the deep in south Richmond. My company kept telling me, you need to move to Richmond. Till I come here and recognize that this is pretty cosmopolitan town. More knowledge I get, better my perspective becomes.\n\nIt becomes more encompassing. So Bhagavan said that one who does not have this perspective, he will not know my nature. Therefore, we will need a Divya Drasthi to see his real nature. His nature in totality so he said muda. Mudha means the one who has not yet developed that perspective. How to see the totality of the Lord's nature.\n\nTherefore we have Learned from verse 4 through 7 How to see him in his totality. That there is nothing which is separate from each other. We are not islands by ourselves. We are connected to each other in a way that we will never be able to separate ourselves from each other. You can't have this class without any one of you. We will need all of you, including myself, to have this class.\n\nBut if I miss that perspective, I am a mudhaha. I think a father cannot be father without a son or a daughter. A daughter cannot be daughter without father and mother. This interdependence we have right from our birth in this world is what we miss is our ego. Then we become I am a self made man. You couldn't even breathe on your own.\n\nSo Bhagavan said, Veda aham. Atitani vartamanani cha Arjuna Bhavishyani chabhutani. I know all the beings of past, present and future. But Mam tu vedana kastyana but no one knows me. It's a real hide and seek game. One who is at the top, but with a greater perspective.\n\nHe sees everything, but we can see him. So Swamiji elaborates on it that why he knows everyone. It's like Krishna saying, I know all the beings in the past, all the beings in future, all the being in the present, but no one knows me. It's like space in Hendrico county makes a claim tomorrow that I know all the buildings in Hendrico county of the past, present and will know all in the future. Because no building is possible without inherent ingredient with the space in it. From the space's perspective, there's no building is unknown.\n\nFrom a building's perspective, I only know the conditioned space. Therefore I think I'm limited. I have birth, I have death. I don't know what is the real nature of the space. I think the nature of the space is the room. So all of us, as soon as we take this identification, we forget the real nature of ourselves and take the identification of the conditioning.\n\nBut from the consciousness perspective. Consciousness is the same consciousness in me as in you, as in him as was in my father, my grandfather, my ancestors, probably 5,000 years ago, same consciousness. Therefore, from a consciousness perspective, the consciousness knew all the beings in the past, all the beings in present and all the beings in future. Because it never changed it remained what it is, the being, the conditioning came and went and will come and go. But the inherent ingredient, the entity which makes it possible remains same. So we know God is omnipresent.\n\nWe none of us somehow not do doubt it. Thing that is omnipresent is by very nature becomes omniscient. If I am all pervading in this chair, I know everything about this space. So Bhagavan is omnipresent and therefore he is omniscient. But from a narrow perspective, if I try to understand Bhagavan, it will never be possible. Therefore he says, Mam tu vedana kastana.\n\nBecause we try to personify him in a limited entity. Therefore North Indian Rama looks like a North Indian and South Indian Rama looks like South Indian. We personify him, the artist from North. When he paints it, he paints it in his imagination. We see Bhagavan in our imagination. So we put all our conditioning on him.\n\nTherefore Bhagavan says, no one knows me. We have to cross over these limitations of our mind and intellect. Therefore it's called transcendental meditation. Icha Dwesa, Samuthena, Dvandwa, Mohena, Bharada. What is it that creating this confusion? Iccha and Dwesha, the likes and dislikes.\n\nSarvabhutani, Sammoham, Sargay, Yanti, Parantabha. All the beings are deluded from very birth what that being likes or dislikes. Right from the birth, the little baby knows what is comfortable and what is not comfortable. As soon as there is something not comfortable, diaper is wet, it starts crying. Because it has taken that conditioning. And per our scriptures, that baby has taken conditioning.\n\nBecause of past vasanas, that body is taken. I take this particular state of existence. That's what I wanted to achieve. That's what I want to experience. He said, why do I go to concert and not go to the boxing wrestling matches? That's what I want to experience, you know.\n\nThat's why I go to the concerts, not to wrestling matches. One who goes to wrestling matches, you tell him to go to opera, no? So he said, you have taken upon your conditioning which you like. Now you are going to divide your world into the world which I like, the world which I don't like. World of my physical existence.

      "commentary": "Unlike a car with its user's manual, we are born without instructions how to live. We experience life vicissitudes without a so called user's manual. The Gita has been described as such a guide. Just to remind us that the Bhagavad Gita divided in three segments six chapters. The first segment we learned all about ourselves. Second chapter did tell us about the summary of who we are.\n\nWhat we remember from second chapter is the self is immutable, imperishable. The myself, which I considered me, is immutable, imperishable. But we never made a connection of what that really means. We say, okay with somebody who realizes that how would he act? How would he behave in this world? Will he be completely different than us that we can find out that's him.\n\nSo we saw the characteristics of a Gnani, but that didn't give us any different than what we do. So the next few chapters gave us how to analyze our actions and our self and then recalibrates our actions become more productive and more effective. And that segment ended with the last chapter, meditation. Meditation is the means given to us to recalibrate this instrument called mind, body and intellect. Then this next segment of this six chapters from 7 to 12 you learned is all about what is that imperishable shelf which we talked about in chapter two. So that's where the way the first chapter of this segment, chapter seven, which is Gnana Vignana Yoga, that we want to have this knowledge about the Lord or that immutable self we Learned in chapter 2.\n\nBut how can we make it a Visishtagnana that we can apply it? And Therefore the Chapter 7 in detail describe the Lord's nature and why we can't realize that in our day to day life. So we saw in the first Bhagavan said that I manifest in this world as the Eightfold Prakriti. That's something which you and I can see where one says, that's Nothing but my own manifestation. Then he says, there is nothing in this world which does not come out of me. Anything that you can see, feel, touch and perceive has came out of me and will dissolve in me.\n\nAnd all this world of plurality as we see, is strung to each other. Nothing is independent, like an island in this universe which is hinting at us that we think we are the island of the universe as me and everything else is revolving around me. He said, no, Everything is strung in a necklace. Pearls are strung into a necklace. And I am that common thread. I pervade through this universe as the Eightfold Prakriti.\n\nAnd you are part of that Prakriti, and I am this. The unmanifest is the common thread among all the manifestations which apparently looks different from each other. They say, why then we are not seeing that? They say, because you are under the spell of my divine Maya, my Maya, which creates this plurality out of singularity. As long as you are under the spell of that, you see yourself different than this world. So we defined that this Maya has these three gunas, or how the Maya create this plurality of infinite varieties of things and beings is because there's three basic gunas, the qualities of Maya, sattvarajas and tamas.\n\nThe permutation combination of these three gunas create myriads of forms and myriads of colors, myriads of shapes, sounds. But as long as I can't overcome that Maya, you can't see it in the last we have seen that. Iccha dwesha, samutena, dhvandvamohena bharat. Because of this desire, or that desire because of, I have divided this world into two. The world I like and the world I don't like. Right from the birth, I'm deluded about myself.\n\nThat immutable, imperishable self talked about in chapter two. I'm not recognizing yet because of only my duality, my concept of duality created by my mind. My mind says, this is me and everything else is the world. As long as I can get out of that concept, out of my mind, Bhagavan said, you won't be able to realize this thing. However, he says in the last three verses, said that those Gnanis who have erased this wrong notion of who I am and their papas are all erased by this new line of thinking. I said, esham tu antagatam papam jananam punya karmana.\n\nSo there is a hope, you know, the Bhagavan said that this is not just a. A philosophical discussion. Then Look, I'M telling you, you will never realize it. Let's figure out what was the problem in the beginning. The problem was my wrong line of thinking that I am different than this world created. This notion that I am this limited being and therefore I have all these problems or whatever.\n\nThe limitation I consider as prabhupada. Once I undo that thinking that I am this limited being that will be gone. So he said, esham tu antagatam papam. Those whose papas have come to an end. And now the classic definition of papa is that sin is a thought or an impression which takes me away from myself, takes me away from my understanding of that I am that immutable, imperishable self and creates this division between I and the world through the papa. As long as I am driven by the desires of the flesh, then my thinking would be to how to fulfill that desire.\n\nWhen I start thinking and if I continue thinking in the same line of thinking, it creates the deep channels in my mind which now guide this second thought into the same channel. This habit of following the same line of thinking to fulfill the desires creates papa. Because I just can get out of that line of thinking that this will make me happy. Last time I had a cup of coffee and made me happy. This time it should do the same thing and I continue to do that. Bhagavan said that creates his own notion of who you are.\n\nHow do I come out of it? He said more and more I become the introvert by the technique given to me in the previous chapter. The meditation that no, this is not me. The one who is getting happy with the Starbucks coffee is not me, is someone other than myself. He said that line of thinking erases those channels which were created by my attempt to satisfy all the desires that my body and mind and intellect has created. More I fulfill my desire, new experiences I get that creates new channels of thinking and that creates new vasanas.\n\nThis vasana, the tendencies creates more the same line of thinking and create the same line of actions. I need to get out of doing actions in the same line of thinking which is not giving me happiness. Even though I figured out the last time I invested money in stock market was not good. But because everybody says, don't miss this cycle, I'm back again. You need to get out of that line of thinking by one side. Once you start meditating on what really makes me happy, if I analyze my experience, is that the experience which made me happy or something else made me happy, you come to the conclusion it is that no desire makes me happy when I'm completely at ease.\n\nThat I don't want anything, I've already eaten my lunch and I don't have anywhere to go and I can just sit down in front of TV or that at least I still have just a desire to watch TV but even if I drop that I probably will be completely happy. Once in the line of thinking creates undoing of all these wrong channels created in my mind. So now I have removed all the papas. Papas are just the wrong line of thinking. Wrong line of vasanas sid eam tu amtagatam papam jananam Punya karmanam Method obviously we have learned in the first six chapter is Karma Yoga selfless actions. When I do the actions in a manner which erases this line of thinking that working for fulfilling my desire makes me happy.\n\nI also realize actually the real happiness I got when I did something for others that the true happiness we get when you do something for our children, something for our parents, something for our relatives, something our friends that really gives you happiness. Janana and Punya Karmana they have changed their line of actions therefore they change the line of their thinking therefore they change the line of their tendencies. And now they are in a completely different realm of actions, completely different realm of thinking that their papas are all erased and said te dwanva mohanermukta so now they are out of this duality that I'm not just working for me, I'm working for the whole humanity, the whole my town, whole my family. I keep expanding my identity. So there is one point, there is no duality between I and the world. Te dvandvam mohanir mukta this dwandva is nothing but a delusion that you and I are different from each other.\n\nThat this world and I are two different entities is nothing but a delusion. He said those who by acting in a right manner erase those line of thinking which creates delusion. And now bhajante maam drabhrataha worshiping, worshipping we have seen is an act of love that the love for the divine becomes so firm that I am firmly established in the thought that I and the world are nothing but part of the same all pervading entity. The next verse says Jara marana mokshaya and why I am doing all of this? Because the two things I'm afraid of in life are jara old age and mara. We had a party yesterday, somebody had Valentine day party and you know what was the topic because we are all probably above 50 there.\n\nHow do we get out of this problem of when you are dying? You know, the 10 tubes going through you because we are afraid of Jarrah old age. I will not be in my control. You know, I was reading time about Ronald Reagan when he was taking a walk and people say good morning Mr. President. He wouldn't recognize why people are calling me president or he didn't know that he was a president. He said this guy is nice that he's greeting me.\n\nThat's all he can think now. The thought that if a person reaches that level and then reaches to a point where he can even recognize who he is is pretty scary for all of us. Because all of our life we took pride in what I'm in control. I take care of myself. I take care of my family. I take care of my business.\n\nI take care of my that I take care. I am in charge makes me who I am. Very thought that I will not be in control is very, very disturbing to us. We want to get out of that. I want to exist and the death wipes me out. It just doesn't seem right.\n\nJara Marana Mokshaya for the liberation from this thought of old age and death. Maam Asritya Taking complete refuge in me means not Lord Krishna or Rama or Jesus in that immutable self. Taking complete refuge in identification with my immutable self. Just as I'm in a complete control in a barber's chair I'm sitting in a barber's chair. The hair which I let go and the hair which I keep, I'm in complete control. The hair which I let go I don't get attached and swelled.\n\nPlease, please pack it up for me. I say wipe it out clean as quickly as possible.",

      "commentary": "We have completed discussion on Chapter 7, Gnana Vigana Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge and Wisdom. And we'll be entering into the discussion of Akshara Brahma Yoga, Yoga of Imperishable Brahman. So starting from chapter one, we have seen in chapter one our own situation, the condition we are in. They're fighting this battle of life. But I get confused about what is right action, whether this is right or that is right. Should I do this or should I do that?\n\nConstantly I'm waffling between this or that and can't come to the right conclusion. So in chapter one, Arjuna kept arguing intellectually, but could not come to any conclusion. In chapter two, in the beginning he surrenders himself to Lord Krishna. Then comes the guidance. So the guidance comes as the revelation about the true nature of our self. So in chapter two, we learned that all that which I have thought about myself was erroneous.\n\nMyself is immortal being. And therefore once I realign my understanding about who I am, everything else will fall in place in a very new pattern. Just like when we are traveling, sometimes a new road pattern get adjusted to it. So unless you pay attention to that, we go back onto the old way which you are traveling on the road, you are going to run into some construction. So the old way of thinking who I am, if I change it to the new way of thinking who I am, then how I act will change completely. So in chapter three, we learn the nature of actions, what actions are all about.\n\nThe actions are binding, but not the ones which are performed in the spirit of Yajna. So the escape hatch is that all my actions should be performed in the spirit of Yajna for the greater good, for the common good, which is Karma Yoga. So we learned that Karma Yoga is the way to act in this world. And then what is Karma Yoga was defined? If you give up the anxiety for the fruits of actions, that's Karma Yoga. So my now goal is I have to act in this world, but I want to renounce actions.\n\nSo chapter Four talked about how to renounce actions in knowledge. Knowing that I'm not the doer, I'll be able to renounce my actions. So that renunciation of the agency is sannyasa. So in chapter five, we learned what the Sannyasa is. Renouncing the anxiety of actions is Karma Yoga. Performing Karma Yoga, I become a Yogi that I become so efficient in my actions that I realized that I am not the doer at all.\n\nAnd that is sannyasa. So chapter five, you learn Sannyasa. Once I renounce this sense of agency, then I have to identify with my true self. So in chapter six we learn the techniques of meditation. How to give up the identity with the self which I have right now, the limited self, the conditioned self which I consider me to the true self. Which we learned in chapter two, how to align with that is chapter six, the techniques of meditation on the self.\n\nBut now how to meditate on the self. What is the subject of my meditation? We learnt in chapter seven. In chapter seven, we learned about the nature of the true supreme self is twofold. One is Lower Prakriti and one is higher Prakriti. The lower is the one which I can experience, perceive, feel, touch and cognize and say this is it.\n\nSo the reality which I can perceive through my senses is the manifest world. The Bhagavan says that's my Lower Prakriti. Everything that you see, touch, feel is made up of my own self. The Asthatha Prakriti. That's his Eightfold which is Bhumi, Apaha, Kham, Analah, Vayuhu, Mana, Buddhi and Ahankar. All five great elements.\n\nMind, intellect and Ahankal, Ego. So there is nothing left. You take any entity in this world, it will fall somewhere in this combination of this eight, start recognizing my Saguna Prakriti. This Prakriti has names and forms. This Saguna Prakriti. But he says there is higher Prakriti which is beyond this Saguna Prakriti which is the Nirguna Prakriti, which is no names, forms, colors, no attributes, no entity, no being.\n\nHe said that's my Higher Prakriti. That Prakriti is what I'm now trying to align myself with in my meditation. Because I can identify with this Saguna Prakriti. So we started our journey from me. Being the most selfish person is only thinking about me as this is me. To now expand my horizon and say I'm little better than That I identify with my family.\n\nI expand my horizon even a little more and say no, no. My community also me, not just my family. Then I even expand my horizon a little more and say no, no, my nation is also me. Then I go a little further and say no, no. This Vasuda aye vai Kutumbakam. This planet is my home.\n\nAnd then I say I'm going to go beyond that. And this cosmos is me. This gradually expanding my identification from this limited me to cosmic me. From a Saguna perspective is which I can do with my open eyes meditation. But then I have to go to the higher Prakriti that is beyond all the names and forms. Bhagawan says that's my imperishable nature.\n\nThat's Akshara Brahma. So the chapter eight now makes an attempt for us to explain what is that higher nature? In the last chapter, in the ending two verses, Bhagavan said that one who knows myself in its totality, Adhibutam, Adhi Daivam and Adhiyagnam. Even at the time of death, even that becomes a glimpse. At the last minute this complete picture becomes clear to me. What is Saguna Prakriti?\n\nWhat is Nirguna Prakriti? And what is this creation is all about? So now Arjuna obviously wants to know all the technical terms he heard in last chapter. So the chapter eight start with Arjuna's question. And as we have seen, he asked Bhagavan to define seven terms he has heard in his discourse. What is that Brahman which you are talking about?\n\nThen what is Adhyatma Kim? We talked about actions we know. Without action I cannot even survive. I cannot maintain my body. Then what is Adhibhuta? You talked about Adhibhuta in the last chapter.\n\nKim Proktam Adhi Daivam. And what is called Adhirdayvam? What is that Kim Uchate? What is it that we call Adhi Daivam? Adi Yagna Katham Ko ata Katham. What what is and how the Yajna is?\n\nAdi Yajna is Dehe asmin Madhusudhana. We have discussed Madhu Sudhana, the slayer of Madhu. Madhu was a demon in our life. That which feels very good is my enemy. I learned that in old age the only taste survive is sweet. I was talking to one of our friends and said I don't know why but I never liked sweets in my life.\n\nAnd now in my old age I like nothing but sweets. Isn't it's very simple. All your taste buds die as you grow older. The only thing survive is the sweet taste buds. So only thing I really taste is the sweet taste. Everything else not very enchanting anymore.\n\nThe slayer of Madhu is Madhu Sudhana. O Madhu Sudhana Prayana kale cha Katham Gneyo asi nyyat Atma Bihi in last verse in last chapter he said even at the last moment if you know this, know myself as Adhi Bhuta Adhi Deva Adi Agna. How do I know even at the last minute that you tell me how should I know? And how I make sure that I will know? How do I live a self controlled life? Niyyatma Bhi Self control so that I will know you at the last minute he recognized that at least there is some exercise I have to do.\n\nNot just rely on a luck or a chance that I will remember him at the last minute just because I name my son. In fact he may distract me Because Rama Rama O Rama went away from here to Austin Texas. I'm glad that I have only one son. His name is not on any Devta Niraj Arjuna says just let me know. All other six questions were relatively irrelevant. He wanted to know in the last minute that was the question.\n\nHow do I leave a self controlled life? So even last minute I will know your real self. And why last minute is so important here That's a milestone. When I decide that I'm going to take a vacation that's a change. From here I'm going there Till that time it doesn't matter I'm here. Mawlik moving from here to Dallas, Texas.\n\nThe day he moves is a milestone. Till that he is just Mawlik. So Prayana kaali Apicha Because I know that I will have the transition from this self to that existence. How do I make sure that I go to right place to know you? And the answer comes in next two verses which actually if we want to discuss can take only six months. We'll do it in next 10 minutes.\n\nAksharam Brahmaparamam Very simple. Brahman is Akshara that which is imperishable is Brahman. Everything that I know in this world is perishable. Brahman is imperishable. That means anything which I can assign a beginning and end is not Brahman. Aksha Ra, that Akshay.\n\nThat which makes I to revel in that form is Akshara. That's why the letters are called Akshara because it becomes real to us. So Saguna from that perspective is Akshara. But Paramam, Aksaram, Brahma, Paramam. That which is higher than Akshara is Brahman. So from that definition, that which is greater than Saguna, different than Saguna is Brahman.\n\nSo now I have to negate. Everything that I know can go beyond my knowledge. Therefore it is transcendental. Knowledge cannot be learned through intellect, cannot be experienced through my mind. It is transcendental. Sobhava, Adhyatma, Uchyadhe.\n\nThey ask what is Adhyatma? Is Sobhava, Adhyatmic knowledge and secular knowledge. Nature of your own self. That which makes me who I am is my Subhabha. So Bhagavan Sankaracharya says that that which makes me who I am is Paramatma. When he decides me is Prayagatma.\n\nAnd when that pratma identifies with this body, mind, intellect, it becomes so. It is something between the Jivatma as I know myself and the Paramatma is all pervading. The part of him which is me is Prayagatma. So that my swabhava, without that I cannot do anything. Therefore he says, when I know my own self, that Adhyatma, Bhuta Bhava Udbhavakara, Visargaha Karma, Sangineedam. Swamiji says this is a very revolutionary definition of Karma.\n\nFrom that perspective, Karma was always considered a ritualistic performance. When you perform any rituals, they were considered Karma. From our Vedic literature, Bhagavana defines Karma as Bhuta Bhava Udbhavakara. That which brings forth beings and things into existence is Karma. So any creative endeavor is Karma. When I create something, it is Karma.\n\nWhen I improve something, it's karma. So Swamiji says that anything else you do is just labor. Therefore nobody congratulates me in the morning when I brush my teeth. Unless you are a 2 years old child, 3 years old. Because it's not a karma unless I assign value to it and say I am doing it to betterment of my teeth. Whether it's a karma, Bhuta Bhava Kara.\n\nThat which creates improvement and brings things and beings into existence is Karma. So Bhagavan's Karma is He creates this universe out of his self as Ishvara. He takes the help of his Maya, becomes Ishwara, becomes Hiranya, Garbha and creates this universe. From our perspective, anything we do to create something, improve something, improve myself, improve, improve the lives of others. That which brings everything down is Papa, not Karma.",
      "reflection": "Consider: If you were to die tonight, what would your final thoughts be? Not to create anxiety, but to clarify priorities. What matters most to you? Are you giving it the attention it deserves?\n\nPractice falling asleep tonight with awareness—watching the transition from waking to sleep as a small rehearsal for the larger letting go. The Gita teaches that our state of consciousness at death is shaped by our entire life. What are you cultivating?\n\nThink about where your mind goes in unguarded moments. This reveals what you truly value, and according to these teachings, points toward your future trajectory."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 8, Akshara Brahma Yoga, Yoga of Imperishable Brahman. The last chapter ended with Bhagavan's statement that one who knows me, even at the time of death, Pryanakala, with reference to the Adi Bhuta, Adi Deva and Adi Yajna in totality will come to me. That was a statement. So Arjuna starts the chapter with question about defining these terms. Adhibhuta, Adhi Deva and Adiyajna. What are those terms?\n\nWhat do they indicate? But he added three more terms, Brahma, Karma and Adyat also to be defined. So what we have seen in the first four verses are the definitions of these terms. And we come to the last question, how the one with the steadfast mind at the end should come to know you. So what we have seen so far is the definition defining Purusha and Prakriti. That which is time bound and which is timeless, that yourself as you consider is time bound right now.\n\nTherefore there is a death. Death is a milestone in your existence. So as we have discussed last time, that these verses in the entire chapter only make sense if you take the concept of reincarnation in its essence as valid principle. But that's also not really the case because it is about the existence. That which you are talking about, the existence which I consider right now is limited existence. Will there be any existence after I die?\n\nThat's a burning question in everyone's mind. Knowingly, unknowingly, consciously, unconsciously, we ask this question whether you believe in reincarnation or not? No culture, no religion has ever questioned the existence. Every religion talks about existence after death. We have difficulty accepting the idea of reincarnation because we are science and technology bound culture which we live in. Unless you are one of those who do not believe in evolution and climate change, we all seek approval from science and technology.\n\nTherefore I don't question whether my cell phone working is the magic. We know it is supported by science and technology. Reincarnation is currently not from our perspective. So even when this topic came last time, Ram has to bring the university research to convince some of us that this also can be researched. But what here is indicated is the existence. That we will exist is not a question in anybody's mind.\n\nTherefore, the incentives for terrorists to become a bomber is what? What would you do with virgins after you die? If you're not existing but you believe you will exist and will have time to enjoy. So the existence is never questioned anywhere. In any religion, in any culture, in any thought, in any philosophy, existence is considered permanent. There was an existence before my birth and there will be existence after my birth.\n\nBut what is now important is what kind of existence I would have. So our culture has put a great emphasis on plan for the existence which is long term, for long term planning. What's the short term planning? Companies who plan for the long term makes progress. Like Warren Buffett does his investment in a long term basis. Some people do investment on quarter to quarter basis.\n\nSo what we do in our life is a short term planning. We are planned that I will have a better life in this life. One life to live is the philosophy, right? There is only one life to live. Oh, Sastra said, no, not true. You have infinite lives to live.\n\nYou have innumerable lives to live. And therefore plan wisely so that your future existence would be more happier. So these verses now try to define how to plan for a long term existence versus short term existence. See, the first thing we learn is Adi Bhuta is perishable. That which I see has been created. Therefore the term Karma is defined.\n\nBhuta Bhava udbhavakara idhi Karma. That which creates Bhuta Bhava, A being is thing is karma. So anything which is created will be perishable. Anything which comes into existence is perishable. So when I'm planning within the realm of objects, it is temporary. So if I want to really plan for a real long term, I want to plan beyond the realm of perishable things and beings.\n\nThat is what they call it. You will come to me, Me, the supreme Me, the imperishable. Because there are two existence which we have known through our discussion. One is imperishable, never perishes, never changes, never have any mutation. And the one which is constantly changing. I clearly identify with the one with changes.\n\nBecause I identify with this, the body, this mind, this intellect. I clearly know that this body is perishable. I have learned through my experiences in life, this body is perishable. And also I have observed from My inferred knowledge that people die and people bury them or burn them, cremate them, so my body will go through the same fate. So we have come to the clear understanding that this body is perishable. What we have not yet understood is the mind and intellect.\n\nA lot of this research which we hear is all about brain, not the mind. Talking to psychiatrists, they say we don't understand mind. We don't know how these medications work. We just know that it works and therefore it is good enough to prescribe. But what mind is is very much a mystery. So it is possible that our ancestors did not know much about the physical senses, but they knew a little more about mind than what we know today.\n\nSo they have come to the conclusion this mind and intellect has life of its own that is beyond this body's life. So prayana kale API in at the time of the journey. That mind and intellect, that mind and intellect remaining intact, is going to make a move. Bhagavan ved vyasa here basically reaffirms our basic principles of Hinduism or Vedantic philosophy, is that this body is the only which dies at the time of death. The jiva, the one which is identifying with this limited mind and intellect, remains intact and seeks another state of existence to exhaust the remaining vasana. Subhagavan in verse 5 gives the same answer which he gave in a statement at the end of chapter 7.\n\nAntakale Chamameva Smaranam uktvakalevaram yaha prayati samad bhavam yati na asti atra sansayaha. Only thing he does is he gives a guarantee. Last time he made a statement, this time he gives a guarantee. I'm selling somebody something, but I don't have means to support all my claims about my product. I guarantee you that if it doesn't work, you can return it to me. I'll return all the money.\n\nSo guarantee is one way of making the student or the buyer feel more comfortable. He already said, one who knows me in totality will come to me. So he said, even at the last moment, because we have considered this life to be the only life for me to make any progress. And if I think I wasted most of my life, what am I going to do now? This is more like my music teacher made a statement to me when I went to him when I was in my 40s. Subhas, do you know that I'm 47?\n\nHe said, so what you're not 67 yet. So now if I go to who will say Subhas, I'm 67. And there's time till. Even at the time of your death, if you come to realize what is truth, thou shall achieve truth. That's the guarantee. Bhagawan says Antakaale chamame vas maran muktvakale varan.\n\nOne who leaves this body at the time of death Antakaala. At the end of this body, he leaves this body. So something is leaving. Somebody is making a journey. That means the one who is identified with the ego has not died yet. That ego is making its own journey now.\n\nFrom this body to somewhere else. From this existence to some other existence. Existence is not questioned. It is the state of existence which is questioned here. Whether will I remain in the same state of existence that I am? Will I retain my wisdom or will I retain my stupidity is the question.\n\nOne who even at the last minute recognizes the truth. He will come to know me. He will come to become one with me. There is no question about it. So he guarantees that you have plenty of time till you die to churn over this idea of what is truth. Even the last moment, if you have eureka moment that oh that's what it is.\n\nBhagawan says that's good enough. Will come to recognize me and realize me. But you still have to make supportive argument. Because we are not born into guarantees. That's why we go into social network and say what are the comments other people have made? You know Meena and I always struggle about the exercise.\n\nSo Meena came across something called seat and cycle. So as usual I said don't worry about 19. Once the orderings, he realized there are five more payments to be made. It was never revealed on that Facebook page. See, there are five more payments. I said if you want to go, go.\n\nBut by the time she had already pressed that button. So then she started reading all the opinions and the comments. They're all pretty bad. This is not a product for elderly. You can fall down also. It took me three times it broke down.\n\nWe said cancel that order as quickly as you can. Because they didn't guarantee. They only said the free trial for 30 days. Bhagwan gave the guarantee. But realize that you will be looking for some support will be watching some comments from the users, you know, other users. So he makes his support.\n\nYam yam vapi smaran Bhavam tyajatyante kalevaram tamtam eva Ithi kaunteya sadh bhava bhavita A statement of fact that whosoever, whosoever you are thinking at the time of leaving your body, that and that person alone thou shall go looking in our own context of our life, who do we meet in life? The people whom we think about most. We constantly think about a person. Then we obviously make a plan to meet. When my mother was alive, I was thinking about her the most. Every two years I was making a plan to go and see her.\n\nNow I really have not. Even though I have my brothers and my nephews and nieces, it's not that much of a pressure on me to go to India anymore. Because I was thinking about my mother all the time. I was feeling guilty that I have left my mother at the age of 17 or 18. Never went home, never took care of her. So constantly was thinking about her.\n\nAnd therefore my plans will be no other vacation. Go to India, stay with her for a few days. So Bhagavan said that it is given that whatever is my constant thought that becomes the last thought at the time of my journey. Where will you go for vacation? Not the place which you have never thought about the vacation you are planning for last six months you have checked all the brochures, you checked out all the prices, you checked out all the hotel accommodations available. What are the places to visit then at the time of your journey to take a vacation.\n\nThat's the ticket you buy and that's the place you end up going. Bhagavan says, one who is constantly thinking about me is the only one who will be thinking about me to come to me. Therefore the next verse says, tasmat sarveshu kale sudha. Therefore at all times mam anusmara think about me. And then he says, Yudhyacha Swamiji says that this half sloka, if misunderstood, can bring down the entire generation.",
      "reflection": "Consider: If you were to die tonight, what would your final thoughts be? Not to create anxiety, but to clarify priorities. What matters most to you? Are you giving it the attention it deserves?\n\nPractice falling asleep tonight with awareness—watching the transition from waking to sleep as a small rehearsal for the larger letting go. The Gita teaches that our state of consciousness at death is shaped by our entire life. What are you cultivating?\n\nThink about where your mind goes in unguarded moments. This reveals what you truly value, and according to these teachings, points toward your future trajectory."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 8, Akshara Brahma Yoga, Yoga of Imperishable Brahman. The last chapter ended with Bhagavan's statement that one who knows me, even at the time of death, Pryanakala, with reference to the Adi Bhuta, Adi Deva and Adi Yajna in totality will come to me. That was a statement. So Arjuna starts the chapter with question about defining these terms. Adhibhuta, Adhi Deva and Adiyajna. What are those terms?\n\nWhat do they indicate? But he added three more terms, Brahma, Karma and Adyat also to be defined. So what we have seen in the first four verses are the definitions of these terms. And we come to the last question, how the one with the steadfast mind at the end should come to know you. So what we have seen so far is the definition defining Purusha and Prakriti. That which is time bound and which is timeless, that yourself as you consider is time bound right now.\n\nTherefore there is a death. Death is a milestone in your existence. So as we have discussed last time, that these verses in the entire chapter only make sense if you take the concept of reincarnation in its essence as valid principle. But that's also not really the case because it is about the existence. That which you are talking about, the existence which I consider right now is limited existence. Will there be any existence after I die?\n\nThat's a burning question in everyone's mind. Knowingly, unknowingly, consciously, unconsciously, we ask this question whether you believe in reincarnation or not? No culture, no religion has ever questioned the existence. Every religion talks about existence after death. We have difficulty accepting the idea of reincarnation because we are science and technology bound culture which we live in. Unless you are one of those who do not believe in evolution and climate change, we all seek approval from science and technology.\n\nTherefore I don't question whether my cell phone working is the magic. We know it is supported by science and technology. Reincarnation is currently not from our perspective. So even when this topic came last time, Ram has to bring the university research to convince some of us that this also can be researched. But what here is indicated is the existence. That we will exist is not a question in anybody's mind.\n\nTherefore, the incentives for terrorists to become a bomber is what? What would you do with virgins after you die? If you're not existing but you believe you will exist and will have time to enjoy. So the existence is never questioned anywhere. In any religion, in any culture, in any thought, in any philosophy, existence is considered permanent. There was an existence before my birth and there will be existence after my birth.\n\nBut what is now important is what kind of existence I would have. So our culture has put a great emphasis on plan for the existence which is long term, for long term planning. What's the short term planning? Companies who plan for the long term makes progress. Like Warren Buffett does his investment in a long term basis. Some people do investment on quarter to quarter basis.\n\nSo what we do in our life is a short term planning. We are planned that I will have a better life in this life. One life to live is the philosophy, right? There is only one life to live. Oh, Sastra said, no, not true. You have infinite lives to live.\n\nYou have innumerable lives to live. And therefore plan wisely so that your future existence would be more happier. So these verses now try to define how to plan for a long term existence versus short term existence. See, the first thing we learn is Adi Bhuta is perishable. That which I see has been created. Therefore the term Karma is defined.\n\nBhuta Bhava udbhavakara idhi Karma. That which creates Bhuta Bhava, A being is thing is karma. So anything which is created will be perishable. Anything which comes into existence is perishable. So when I'm planning within the realm of objects, it is temporary. So if I want to really plan for a real long term, I want to plan beyond the realm of perishable things and beings.\n\nThat is what they call it. You will come to me, Me, the supreme Me, the imperishable. Because there are two existence which we have known through our discussion. One is imperishable, never perishes, never changes, never have any mutation. And the one which is constantly changing. I clearly identify with the one with changes.\n\nBecause I identify with this, the body, this mind, this intellect. I clearly know that this body is perishable. I have learned through my experiences in life, this body is perishable. And also I have observed from My inferred knowledge that people die and people bury them or burn them, cremate them, so my body will go through the same fate. So we have come to the clear understanding that this body is perishable. What we have not yet understood is the mind and intellect.\n\nA lot of this research which we hear is all about brain, not the mind. Talking to psychiatrists, they say we don't understand mind. We don't know how these medications work. We just know that it works and therefore it is good enough to prescribe. But what mind is is very much a mystery. So it is possible that our ancestors did not know much about the physical senses, but they knew a little more about mind than what we know today.\n\nSo they have come to the conclusion this mind and intellect has life of its own that is beyond this body's life. So prayana kale API in at the time of the journey. That mind and intellect, that mind and intellect remaining intact, is going to make a move.

But you still have to make supportive argument. Because we are not born into guarantees. That's why we go into social network and say what are the comments other people have made? You know Meena and I always struggle about the exercise.\n\nSo Meena came across something called seat and cycle. So as usual I said don't worry about 19.

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter eight, Akshara Brahma Yoga, Yoga of Imperishable Brahman. And as we have seen so far, the first four verses gave us the nature of the Brahman, the immanence and transcendence of Brahman, that everything they can think about, Shara and Akshara is all Brahman. It's all his manifestation. And then in the next few verses we have seen that how at the time of death, death of the state of existence, death of this thought, death of ego, how one can recognize that permanence of the self. And last few verses, Bhagawan had been giving us the word picture of that imperishable Brahman. So we have seen the Kavim Puranam Anusasitharam that he is omniscient, he is ancient and he is having the lordship over everything.\n\nBut that picture also doesn't give us the complete picture. He is minuter than minute. It is not something we can paint a picture in our head or formulate a form in our head. So anything we can formulate a form is not him. It is beyond capacity of our intellect. And Sarvasya Dhaataram Achinte Rupam.\n\nHe is a supporter of all and it cannot be thought of. Aditya Varanam tama Sahaprasthat. He is self effulgent. It does not require any other means to know him. By its very nature he reveals himself. Awareness itself is him.\n\nI need to be aware of an object. For an object to be known, I have to be aware of it. So my awareness is necessary to make that object revealed to myself. But my awareness itself does not require anything to be known to me. Awareness itself makes itself available. So the next few verses talked about the Pryanakala.\n\nWe have seen the difference between Antakaala and Pryanakala. Priyanakala is the time of departure. I may be coming back. My departure may be for going now and coming back again. Antikala is the last end of it. I'm not going anywhere.\n\nOnce I go there, I'm not coming back. So the one who at the time of departure focus on the nature of the self, he will also achieve that realization of the impermanence. So the whole goal we have seen so far is gaining the experience of something which we have not experienced before. Gaining the experience of something. We had been striving all our life. Knowingly or unknowingly?\n\nWe had been trying to find a state of existence where there is no sorrow, there is no imperfection. There is no un unhappiness. That state we're constantly struggling to achieve by all other means. All the means which are available to us through our equipment with body, mind and intellect. And we try and employ all three of them to achieve the state of perfection. There is no unhappiness, there is no sorrow, there is no disease.\n\nAnd as Bhagavan Buddha found out, there is nothing like that in this world. So there got to be a place or state because otherwise we won't be striving for it. If health is not my nature, I won't be striving for health. I'll be very happy, be unhealthy. But that's not my natural state of my existence. Therefore as soon as something happens, I run to the doctor, fix it.\n\nSo unhappiness also cannot be a natural thing to me. However, I'm constantly unhappy. So what should I be doing to achieving that? So what we have seen last is Yat Aksaram Veda Vido Vadanti. That imperishable state which the knower Suvida talks about. That there is a state where all that you are seeking is available.\n\nVishyanti Yat Yoho Vit Ragaha. People give up everything in life to achieve that state. Brahmacharyam Charanti. By desiring that people practice Brahmacharya. Last time as we have seen Brahma Acharya Brahmachari. One who is reveling or pursuing the path of Brahman is Brahmachari.\n\nOne who is following the path of action is a Karmachari. In Hindi, as we have discussed last time, the clerks are called Karmacharis. But you know, one who is their boss is called Adyaksha. One who keeps eye on them is Adyaksha. So we are Karmachari in all our day to day life. Because we constantly see what is next.\n\nI have done this, I've been there. Somebody says take a cruise I have done it. Tell me something else which I can do. Because we are constantly what is, what will be our next action. Brahmacharya is constantly seeking. How do I become one with the Brahman is Brahmachari and who is Adyakshaya?\n\nIn this case our consciousness is keeping eye on what's happening. See Tate pada sangrahena pravakshya. I'm going to tell you that state of existence which you had been seeking all your life and you tried everything so far. But I have not achieved. So I'm going to tell you in a summary. So the next few verses.\n\nNow Bhagavan explains how that state can be achieved. So the next verse says sarvadvarani samyamya mano ruddin irudhyyacha murdni adhay atmanah pranam astito yogadharana. This is obviously explaining the technique of meditation. We want to experience that state. I cannot be experiencing in our day to day life, but at least I can have a glimpse in my meditation. In meditation what I get is a glimpse of that state where there is no unhappiness, there is no sorrow.\n\nBut that cannot be just a 20 minutes a day or 30 minutes a day or once in the morning and once in the evening. It has to be continuous state of existence. I am not seeking a temporary happiness, I'm seeking permanent happiness. It says Sarva dwarani samyamya. So far everything that I have experienced unhappiness is because of my sense perception. When I see that temperature outside is not conducive to my liking because I feel it, then I feel unhappy.\n\nSo senses are telling me whether it's conducive or unconducive. If those information is not available to me, then I will not know. Just in my deep sleep, I'm not aware what temperature the room is, what's happening outside is Donald Trump is winning or Hillary Clinton is ahead. None of that is existence in my deep sleep. So the first thing we notice is these senses which are causing this agitation in my mind. So Sarva dhvanani samyamya, let's experience what happens when I close all the gates of information.\n\nYou know, people who take retreat these days, it's very difficult to take one retreat because 10 years or 20 years ago when we used to take retreat, they will say, you can't take radio with you. You cannot take anything with you. So don't listen to radio and don't listen to television. But now people take phone, you know the phone. Everything is television and is on your phone. Because the idea of retreat was that you are constantly bombarded with information which distract well, at least for that week.\n\nYou are cut off from the world outside. What's happening politically, what's happening in a profession, all that you're not listening. So this takes that idea to an extreme and say close all your senses when you sit down in meditation. Sarva dwarani Samyami. Controlling all your gates. Manohrudi Nirudhyacha.\n\nPlacing your mind in your heart. In a sense placing your mind which was running outside in a day to day life. The mind's job is to go outside and get information. The clerk who is gathering all the data from outside and reporting it to intellect. The adyaksha giving it to intellect to decipher the data. Make that mind inward.\n\nHruddhi means inward. Basically to your on yourself focus. Your thoughts should be only one and one alone. What is my real self is that's the thought, one single thought. Murdni Adha Atmanah Having your pranas in your head. Now this looks like a very high level yogic exercises.\n\nNow it can be but you can look at it in many different ways. At our level, this is a technique of a meditation when at least for those 20 minutes you're trying to cut off yourself from this world. You cut off yourself from your senses, cut off all your mind from running out and turn inward. Then say Murdni a day atman. Focus all your pranas into your head. Now sit down for meditation.\n\nSee where you feel any life. At that time, all your focus will be on your head. Therefore in the technical meditation chapter six we said focus your mind between your two eyebrows. Because you're not aware of rest of the body, you're dropping all your awareness about the rest of your body. You're focusing only the one thing, one thing alone. Your computer which is functioning at that time in your head.\n\nThey said placing your pranas, all the activity, the physiological activities happening in your body. You're only aware of what's happening in your mind at the head at the time. Therefore the pranayama helps. Because first you focus on the breathing. Right now I'm focusing on everything that is happening in my body. My legs are moving, my hands are moving, my lips are moving.\n\nWhen doing meditation you stop thinking about your legs and hands and mouth and you only start thinking about what's happening in your mind. So all the pranas which are functioning. So when you first start focusing only on your breath. You are not focusing anything else which is going on in your body. That puts you in a state where mind will calm down. And then you can just focus on who I am.\n\nSo only one thought and one thought alone. Pranam astitha Yogadharanam. One who has been practicing this over and over and over again, he can achieve the state of meditation very easily. And the next verse says Omiti ek aksanam Brahman. This is truly a technique of meditation we have learnt in chapter six. He's putting it again in a very succinct manner for you to understand.\n\nWhat is the goal of meditation? The goal of meditation to give us a glimpse what that state where there is no limitation, where there is no unhappiness, there is no sorrows, just bliss. Sister, once you have now controlled your senses and your mind and your pranas. Omiti ek aksaram Brahma vyaharan mam anusmaran Chant with one syllable Om which is the sound symbol of God. God can be pictured in many different ways, but the simplest and non distracting forming the word Om. And we have seen before.\n\nThe Om represents the creation, sustenance and destruction or the past, present and future. But that one word contains everything that needs to be known about the self. So it's Vyaharan Mam Anusman who is uttering that one syllable. Omn ma manusmara Om also don't get focused in love. Let me write a tita is on Aum. I'm thinking about that self which is all pervading and the Om is representing it.\n\nFirst you can start chanting out loud, then gradually lower your pitch and then just chant in your mind, constantly thinking about that oneself and oneself alone which parades everywhere and choose chanting Aum yah prayati tyajan Deham. One who leaves this body, you can consider that as your death. That is the time of death. All this which we have learned in this last two verses, we all have known. Looking at people who have died in front of your eyes, it is not possible. At the time of death you are not there to meditate.\n\nYou have no control over what's happening. So this is the death. In your meditation of your identification with your body, mind and intellect. Yaha prayati tyajan Deham. The complete detachment from the identification with this body. In my meditation Sa yati paramam gatima he experiences that supreme state of existence.\n\nIf you perfect your meditation to a point that I can Control all my senses.",

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter eight, Akshara Brahma Yoga, Yoga of Imperishable Brahman. And as we have seen so far, the first four verses gave us the nature of the Brahman, the immanence and transcendence of Brahman, that everything they can think about, Shara and Akshara is all Brahman. It's all his manifestation. And then in the next few verses we have seen that how at the time of death, death of the state of existence, death of this thought, death of ego, how one can recognize that permanence of the self. And last few verses, Bhagawan had been giving us the word picture of that imperishable Brahman. So we have seen the Kavim Puranam Anusasitharam that he is omniscient, he is ancient and he is having the lordship over everything.\n\nBut that picture also doesn't give us the complete picture. He is minuter than minute. It is not something we can paint a picture in our head or formulate a form in our head. So anything we can formulate a form is not him. It is beyond capacity of our intellect. And Sarvasya Dhaataram Achinte Rupam.\n\nHe is a supporter of all and it cannot be thought of. Aditya Varanam tama Sahaprasthat. He is self effulgent. It does not require any other means to know him. By its very nature he reveals himself. Awareness itself is him.\n\nI need to be aware of an object. For an object to be known, I have to be aware of it. So my awareness is necessary to make that object revealed to myself. But my awareness itself does not require anything to be known to me. Awareness itself makes itself available. So the next few verses talked about the Pryanakala.\n\nWe have seen the difference between Antakaala and Pryanakala. Priyanakala is the time of departure. I may be coming back. My departure may be for going now and coming back again. Antikala is the last end of it. I'm not going anywhere.\n\nOnce I go there, I'm not coming back. So the one who at the time of departure focus on the nature of the self, he will also achieve that realization of the impermanence. So the whole goal we have seen so far is gaining the experience of something which we have not experienced before. Gaining the experience of something. We had been striving all our life. Knowingly or unknowingly?\n\nWe had been trying to find a state of existence where there is no sorrow, there is no imperfection. There is no un unhappiness. That state we're constantly struggling to achieve by all other means. All the means which are available to us through our equipment with body, mind and intellect. And we try and employ all three of them to achieve the state of perfection. There is no unhappiness, there is no sorrow, there is no disease.\n\nAnd as Bhagavan Buddha found out, there is nothing like that in this world. So there got to be a place or state because otherwise we won't be striving for it. If health is not my nature, I won't be striving for health. I'll be very happy, be unhealthy. But that's not my natural state of my existence. Therefore as soon as something happens, I run to the doctor, fix it.\n\nSo unhappiness also cannot be a natural thing to me. However, I'm constantly unhappy. So what should I be doing to achieving that? So what we have seen last is Yat Aksaram Veda Vido Vadanti. That imperishable state which the knower Suvida talks about. That there is a state where all that you are seeking is available.\n\nVishyanti Yat Yoho Vit Ragaha. People give up everything in life to achieve that state. Brahmacharyam Charanti. By desiring that people practice Brahmacharya. Last time as we have seen Brahma Acharya Brahmachari. One who is reveling or pursuing the path of Brahman is Brahmachari.\n\nOne who is following the path of action is a Karmachari. In Hindi, as we have discussed last time, the clerks are called Karmacharis. But you know, one who is their boss is called Adyaksha. One who keeps eye on them is Adyaksha. So we are Karmachari in all our day to day life. Because we constantly see what is next.\n\nI have done this, I've been there. Somebody says take a cruise I have done it. Tell me something else which I can do. Because we are constantly what is, what will be our next action. Brahmacharya is constantly seeking. How do I become one with the Brahman is Brahmachari and who is Adyakshaya?\n\nIn this case our consciousness is keeping eye on what's happening. See Tate pada sangrahena pravakshya. I'm going to tell you that state of existence which you had been seeking all your life and you tried everything so far. But I have not achieved. So I'm going to tell you in a summary. So the next few verses.\n\nNow Bhagavan explains how that state can be achieved. So the next verse says sarvadvarani samyamya mano ruddin irudhyyacha murdni adhay atmanah pranam astito yogadharana. This is obviously explaining the technique of meditation. We want to experience that state. I cannot be experiencing in our day to day life, but at least I can have a glimpse in my meditation. In meditation what I get is a glimpse of that state where there is no unhappiness, there is no sorrow.\n\nBut that cannot be just a 20 minutes a day or 30 minutes a day or once in the morning and once in the evening. It has to be continuous state of existence. I am not seeking a temporary happiness, I'm seeking permanent happiness. It says Sarva dwarani samyamya. So far everything that I have experienced unhappiness is because of my sense perception. When I see that temperature outside is not conducive to my liking because I feel it, then I feel unhappy.\n\nSo senses are telling me whether it's conducive or unconducive. If those information is not available to me, then I will not know. Just in my deep sleep, I'm not aware what temperature the room is, what's happening outside is Donald Trump is winning or Hillary Clinton is ahead. None of that is existence in my deep sleep. So the first thing we notice is these senses which are causing this agitation in my mind. So Sarva dhvanani samyamya, let's experience what happens when I close all the gates of information.\n\nYou know, people who take retreat these days, it's very difficult to take one retreat because 10 years or 20 years ago when we used to take retreat, they will say, you can't take radio with you. You cannot take anything with you. So don't listen to radio and don't listen to television. But now people take phone, you know the phone. Everything is television and is on your phone. Because the idea of retreat was that you are constantly bombarded with information which distract well, at least for that week.\n\nYou are cut off from the world outside. What's happening politically, what's happening in a profession, all that you're not listening. So this takes that idea to an extreme and say close all your senses when you sit down in meditation. Sarva dwarani Samyami. Controlling all your gates. Manohrudi Nirudhyacha.\n\nPlacing your mind in your heart. In a sense placing your mind which was running outside in a day to day life. The mind's job is to go outside and get information. The clerk who is gathering all the data from outside and reporting it to intellect. The adyaksha giving it to intellect to decipher the data. Make that mind inward.\n\nHruddhi means inward. Basically to your on yourself focus. Your thoughts should be only one and one alone. What is my real self is that's the thought, one single thought. Murdni Adha Atmanah Having your pranas in your head. Now this looks like a very high level yogic exercises.\n\nNow it can be but you can look at it in many different ways. At our level, this is a technique of a meditation when at least for those 20 minutes you're trying to cut off yourself from this world. You cut off yourself from your senses, cut off all your mind from running out and turn inward. Then say Murdni a day atman. Focus all your pranas into your head. Now sit down for meditation.\n\nSee where you feel any life. At that time, all your focus will be on your head. Therefore in the technical meditation chapter six we said focus your mind between your two eyebrows. Because you're not aware of rest of the body, you're dropping all your awareness about the rest of your body. You're focusing only the one thing, one thing alone. Your computer which is functioning at that time in your head.\n\nThey said placing your pranas, all the activity, the physiological activities happening in your body. You're only aware of what's happening in your mind at the head at the time. Therefore the pranayama helps. Because first you focus on the breathing. Right now I'm focusing on everything that is happening in my body. My legs are moving, my hands are moving, my lips are moving.\n\nWhen doing meditation you stop thinking about your legs and hands and mouth and you only start thinking about what's happening in your mind. So all the pranas which are functioning. So when you first start focusing only on your breath. You are not focusing anything else which is going on in your body. That puts you in a state where mind will calm down. And then you can just focus on who I am.\n\nSo only one thought and one thought alone. Pranam astitha Yogadharanam. One who has been practicing this over and over and over again, he can achieve the state of meditation very easily. And the next verse says Omiti ek aksanam Brahman. This is truly a technique of meditation we have learnt in chapter six. He's putting it again in a very succinct manner for you to understand.\n\nWhat is the goal of meditation? The goal of meditation to give us a glimpse what that state where there is no limitation, where there is no unhappiness, there is no sorrows, just bliss. Sister, once you have now controlled your senses and your mind and your pranas. Omiti ek aksaram Brahma vyaharan mam anusmaran Chant with one syllable Om which is the sound symbol of God. God can be pictured in many different ways, but the simplest and non distracting forming the word Om. And we have seen before.\n\nThe Om represents the creation, sustenance and destruction or the past, present and future. But that one word contains everything that needs to be known about the self. So it's Vyaharan Mam Anusman who is uttering that one syllable. Omn ma manusmara Om also don't get focused in love. Let me write a tita is on Aum. I'm thinking about that self which is all pervading and the Om is representing it.\n\nFirst you can start chanting out loud, then gradually lower your pitch and then just chant in your mind, constantly thinking about that oneself and oneself alone which parades everywhere and choose chanting Aum yah prayati tyajan Deham. One who leaves this body, you can consider that as your death. That is the time of death. All this which we have learned in this last two verses, we all have known. Looking at people who have died in front of your eyes, it is not possible. At the time of death you are not there to meditate.\n\nYou have no control over what's happening. So this is the death. In your meditation of your identification with your body, mind and intellect. Yaha prayati tyajan Deham. The complete detachment from the identification with this body. In my meditation Sa yati paramam gatima he experiences that supreme state of existence.\n\nIf you perfect your meditation to a point that I can Control all my senses.",
      "reflection": "Consider: If you were to die tonight, what would your final thoughts be? Not to create anxiety, but to clarify priorities. What matters most to you? Are you giving it the attention it deserves?\n\nPractice falling asleep tonight with awareness—watching the transition from waking to sleep as a small rehearsal for the larger letting go. The Gita teaches that our state of consciousness at death is shaped by our entire life. What are you cultivating?\n\nThink about where your mind goes in unguarded moments. This reveals what you truly value, and according to these teachings, points toward your future trajectory."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 8, Akshara Brahma Yoga Yoga of Imperishable Brahman this world which I live in has things and beings. Things have their production date or a date of creation and will also have a date of destruction. And the beings have their birth dates and also they will have their death dates. Then nothing in this world remains permanently. Everything is perishable, exists for a limited period in both time and space. But this ever changing reality which I experience as the world cannot exist unless there is an imperishable substratum.\n\nAnd Bhagavan said in this chapter that Brahman is that imperishable reality. Brahman is the truth which makes all other relative truths possible. For example, I can say this room exists. That's a statement of truth. But it only exists because the another universal truth exists. That is the room space existed before this room was built.\n\nIt is right now here as room space and will remain space when this room will be destroyed. So based on that universal reality which I call space, the relative reality, what I call room space can exist. Bhagavan says the Brahman in a similar way exists. As Bhagawan Shankaracharya says, the principle that graces all bodies is their essential self. Any being will not be aware of his own self unless that principle, imperishable immortal principle is residing in that body. With that consciousness I become aware of my conditioning which I call my body, mind and intellect.\n\nAnd then I'm aware of myself. So it is the self knowing reality which is the very nature of Brahman which makes me aware of myself as that conditioned self. Right now I'm not aware of my supreme self that is imperishable, deathless and birthless. But I'm aware of myself as this limited body, limited mind, limited intellect, as Nil Bhatt because of that consciousness which is functioning through me. So the Bhagavan says that that consciousness which is now making you aware of your own limitations and also making you aware of the existence of this world of Perishable nature. And as long as I am conditioned and identified by this body, mind and intellect, I will have all the limitations of this body, mind and intellect.\n\nAnd therefore the sorrows, therefore unhappiness. And therefore I feel bound by these limitations. My goal is to liberate myself from my limitations, my unhappiness, my sorrows and attain a state of bliss where there never will be any sorrow, never will be any limitations and never will be any unhappiness. Bhagavan said, that can only happen when you identify with me, the imperishable and not the one who is conditioned by your body, mind and intellect. As long as I remain aware of the limitations of the room, I will be only seeing the space as the room space. If I want to see this space as immortal.\n\nIf I never want to get this space destroyed, I'll be always afraid of what happens if someone destroys this building. If earthquake happens or a meteor falls on my property, well, it will be destroyed. Is the room space getting destroyed? But right now I'm more identified with the conditioning than the space itself. And therefore that fear of destruction. If my identification was not with the conditioning, just the space.\n\nThis is my land and this is my space. And I want to own this thing forever. But once it's possible, nothing can destroy the space which you're owning. Only thing that can destroy whatever you have built on that land, on that space, the space will never be destroyed. But as long as my identification with that building, on that land, I'll be afraid. When my identification is beyond that, then I will not be afraid of the destruction of the building.\n\nSo Bhagavan said, one who identifies with me, he will come to attain me. Antakale chamameva kalevaram ya prayasi prayati sasad madh bhavam yati na asti tatra sansayah. There is no doubt that one who gives up this identification with this body, mind and intellect while leaving this identification as the death and thinking about me alone will come to me. There is no doubt about that. So the advice we have seen so far, it says, therefore, tasmat sarveshu kale sumamanusmaryudyyacha. Therefore engage in this battle of life constantly remembering me as your true self.\n\nNot this conditioned self as your true self, but me, the imperishable, who is making it possible for you to function. Fight this battle of life with that in mind. And thou shall be liberated from these limitations. And you will come to be one with me once you become one with me. After that there is no coming and going again. Maam upetya punar janma du kalayam asasvatam na apnuvanti.\n\nHaving attained me, there is no coming and going back to this house of pain we call this world. But now Bhagavan says, in a stark contrast to the ones who have identified with me and one who has become one with me. If you're striving to achieve that liberation but haven't reached that prerequisite qualification, then you will constantly come back and forth. So the next verse 16 says, Abhram ponat lokah punara vartinau Arjuna Mam upetyatu kamteya punarjan manna vidya the world up to the world of Brahmaji, Brahmaloga aa Brahma Bhuvan lokad up to the world of Brahmaji. They are subject to birth and rebirth. Punara vartina Constantly coming again and again, coming back to the same thing.\n\nOne who reaches me, there is no rebirth for him. So what does that mean, reaching up to the world of Brahmaji? Brahmaji is the creator. As we know in our Hindu Trinity, Brahma is the creator, Vishnu is the sustainer and Shiva is the destroyer. This creative destruction is constantly going on in this world. Brahma is the ultimate creator of this entire universe.\n\nSo in our concept of Hiranyagarbha in Vedanta, it is the ultimate creator. It is the total mind and total intellectual. I am a creator of my own world. You are a creator of your world and she is the creator of her world. We create our world through our mind and intellect depending on our desires and vasanas. Now if I take this group and say one, we individually we have our vasanas and desire, but we also have a group vasanas and desires.\n\nSo we'll say, well, when are we going to have the Janmastami next? So everybody will say, well, I would like to have it on such and such and let's do this and let's do that. These common thoughts put together what we call it a planning, a group planning will have group activity. So that's a mind which is expanded from my mind to a group's mind. You can continue to expand this mind and intellect, including more and more people and beings into it. When you reach the ultimate limit of all the beings and and things, all the minds and intellects put together is Brahmaji Brahma the creator.\n\nWhen my identification rises from me to My family, to my neighborhood, to my community. I'm expanding my identity and including them as my own self. So I may be making progress in my spiritual evolution in expanding my identity, but until I reach that pre qualifying limit, I still have to come back over and over again. Well, it is something like this. If you are taking any licensing examination, for those of you who are professionals who have to take the licensing exam, you probably know all about it. But I took mine in this country when I came here in 84, and I knew that it was going to be difficult because I have barely come here, no experience in this country, and people have already warned me, going to take you a long time to get this license in this country simply because there were nine parts of exam and you have to clear all nine parts, then you get a license.\n\nSo the firm I had joined initially a large firm, and there were at least about a couple of hundred people, at least at any given year, there are about 60 to 80 people taking exams. So they told me that, you take it easy, Neil. You just came to this country, it's going to take you eight to 10 years before you can pass this exam. And I say, what do you mean by that? I don't understand what you're saying. Why should it take so long and say, well, here is how it works.\n\nYou'll take the exams and you probably will pass out of nine, maybe two parts, and then you will come back again next year and may pass another couple of parts, then you will come back after next year and may pass one or two. And people who experience this, so they have formulated an average time it takes for somebody to get the license as an architect in this country after graduating from architecture school, it takes about six to eight or eight to 10 years to do that, because till you pass all nine parts, and then if any one subject, if you fail more than three times, you take all nine parts all over again. There are some people I knew who have already given up taking tests for these licensing exams. And I said, well, all you have to do is pass all nine parts and it will be fine. They say, yeah, that sounds easy, but it is not. And that was obviously their perception of this.\n\nSo they go, take exam, come back, take exam and come back till you reach a point when 9th part is cleared, then you get a license. And one who reaches the ninth part, he also have to maintain that vigilance that after even passing the nine parts and getting a license, he still have to maintain his continuing education to remain effective as an architect. Well, this is something like this. Bhagavan said that we are all trying our spiritual evolution as seekers. And we reach from the level we are right now to the next level as we make more progress. But at the time of death, if my evolution has not gone up to the level where I can be liberated, well, I'll have to come back, just as I said, with the time of my taking the exams.\n\nIf I'm not cleared all nine parts, then I have to come back next year to clear whatever parts are left. Same way, in our spiritual journey, things we have learned and things which are yet to be learned will decide how many times I have to come back. And this is driven by my desires and vasanas. My desire will make me come back to that state, that stage which makes me feel comfortable that I can make progress from here. After I pass my high school graduation, I go to the undergraduate school. I cannot just say that after my high school graduation, just leave me alone now my education is finished.\n\nTo get to a doctorate level, I have to make my own efforts. So up to the world of Brahmaji. In the world of Brahmaji, you have the identification with this entire creation. And as Swamiji explains here that in the concept of gradual liberation, Karma Mukti, which is accepted in Vedanta, it basically says that karma with Upasana can lead you to the realm of Brahmaji. If you do your karma diligently with devotion to the Lord, you will reach a state of identification where you will feel the whole world is your own being and you reach the world of Brahmaji. Once reaching that, there is no coming back.\n\nFrom that, you will just merge into the supreme Brahman.",

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 8, Akshara Brahma Yoga Yoga of Imperishable Brahman as we have seen that we are trying to understand the nature of the supreme reality, so we have to do some heavy lifting here to understand the underlying concepts in this chapter. So in the beginning we have heard from Bhagavan that Brahman is imperishable, immutable, Self knowledge is its nature. So what is the nature of Brahman? It is self knowledge. It does not require any other aid to understand it. So it's self effulgent.\n\nIt's very nature is self knowledge. With its creative force, it works to create things and beings. What his work is that which creates these things and beings. That Brahman which is imperishable, its nature is self knowledge. With its own creative force, it works to create things and beings. Then what is nature of the things and beings that Brahman has created?\n\nBrahman is imperishable, but anything that is created by its creative force is perishable. That because the very act of creation gives it a birth date, it's now created. Something is created, therefore it will have its own life. Then it will get destroyed. It will have a limited shelf life as we call it, no matter how long. That is what makes those things and beings function as they are.\n\nIs a Daivam inherently that same Brahman remaining within each created entity? That Daivam makes the thing or being possible as a creation. But out of all this activity, when these things and beings are reacting with each other, it's only possible because Brahman remains present as the Yajnam in all the activities, that Supreme Being is present. Therefore all activities are possible in this world of these created beings. Analogy we have heard before is more like my dream. I as the conscious being have experiences in my waking world.\n\nThe same experiences at night gets all jumbled up. My mind creates its own world. Out of my own mind, I create my own world. That mind by itself creates various entities, things and beings in My dream. Those entities are acting in the dream because I am in and through available to project the dream. But when I wake up, all those entities, things and beings are now unmanifest.\n\nTill next time I go to sleep again and dream again. So this is what we have seen is how the overall cosmos is functioning at the level of Brahman. Him remaining supreme, unchangeable with his self knowledge, with his own creative force, he works to create these things and beings. These things and beings, their Gunana Dharma. I studied chemistry in Gujarati because I studied all throughout my school days, in college days in Gujarati medium in chemistry they used to ask us Padarthana Gunadharmanu Varnankara describes the characteristics and nature of this substance. So there are two things every substance has Guna and Dharma.\n\nGuna is the basic characteristics of that substance or a thing or a being. And Dharma is the nature of that substance depending on guna. So what is my Dharma is depending on my gunas. The gunas which I have as an entity creates my Dharma. So Guna and Dharma are related to each other. So Brahman creating things and beings.\n\nEach thing and being has its own Dharma, Guna and Dharma. This Guna and Dharma continues to change as we acquire more impressions. So my guna before I went to architecture school has nothing to do with architecture. In fact, I was not even aware of what architecture is all about. So at that point my Dharma had nothing to do with architectural knowledge or practice. More I acquired the architectural knowledge.\n\nMy gunas changed, so my Dharma changed. So now I practice architecture. So Guna Dharma is constantly changing this evolutionary path a thing or being takes in the creation itself. So Bhagavan said that this creation is now guided by its own laws, where each thing and being is driven by their own guna and Dharma. So what will be my next state of existence? The gunas which I am creating through my experiences as practicing architect or the Bhagavad Gita student.\n\nSo my next state of existence can only be evolution from a present state. It cannot completely change overnight from where I am today. So that's the evolutionary path each thing and being in the creation takes. So from some stardust, my original evolution started and then that keeps changing. Gunanayana Dharma came to this level where I am today. I read in some one of these popular science books that our atoms in the body continues to change.\n\nThey are not the same atoms because our body, the cells change every few years. And they said that it is possible that the atoms which exist in Shakespeare's body or Rama's body or Krishna's body has passed through my body at one point of because there are finite amount of energy, finite amount of matter, all things and beings are created out of that. In the nature of this cosmos is one thing changes into the shape and form of other and continues. So where I am today is the product of my past. From that stardust to who I am today, my future would be the product of my present, present plus my past. So the advice then given to us is that if you want to accelerate this evolution, not go through this gradual path of changing Guna and Dharma, that you can directly relate to the Source which is we have seen the Brahman who is imperishable, immutable, created this universe out of his own creative force that the efficient cause, he's created for the efficient cause to create this own universe.\n\nMaterial cause was the only thing available to Brahman, which is his own self. He created this universe out of his own self. And each creation has limited life. Creation remains perishable, but the underlying material which creates this universe remains imperishable. So either I can identify with my Guna and a Dharma today and then take a step next forward in the same path of my evolution, or I can short circuit this whole cycle and go straight to my source where I started. So that's the advice in this chapter.\n\nAt the time of death, death is the end of this state of existence Is death. Created today, death of today will create tomorrow. At the time of this transition, whatever I think would be my next state of existence, that's what I will become. Bhagawan said, you can focus directly onto the Source and become source up to the Brahma Loka, the world of Brahma, everything has coming and going. Till we are within the realm of this Prakriti which is made up of nothing but the total things and beings in this world. I will be keep recycling from one state of existence to another.\n\nAnd that we have said how long it will continue. Then we have said is as long as the Brahma is creating and dissolving. So we see our day and night from our day to day activities. Day is the active _part of my life. Night is the inactive _part of my life. Superimposing the same concept on Brahmaji is the total creator.\n\nI am the creator of my world. You are the creator of your world. She is the creator of her world. When you put all things and beings together, all the ideas and vasanas and thoughts together create cosmic mind. The cosmic mind has the latency to create this cosmos. And that's called Hiranyagarpa, the golden embryo, which is all the possibilities of creating everything that is in this cosmos that continues to be go in the cycles of activity and inactivity.\n\nWhen Brahma is actively creating, it's his day. When he takes rest and is inactive, it's night for him. Because we superimpose our day and night on my day is activity, my night is inactivity. It's not different now with nightlife. But in 5,000 years ago they probably didn't have night life. What is Brahma's day?\n\nBrahma's day is thousand eons. So for thousand eons this activity of creation continues. Things changing from one thing to another to another. And then Brahmaji takes rest. All the things which he has created now goes into dormant state. Not get destroyed, gets into dormant state.\n\nJust as I, the architect, goes into dormant state from Friday to Sunday. But that doesn't mean the architect in me has died. Architect in me will wake up on Monday morning and start all over again. So all the ideas and thoughts and vasanas in this total mind goes into hibernation in dormant state. He said, how long that lasts? Another thousand year.\n\nSo we did some calculation the other day and said it's 4.316 million years is one year. So thousand of these 4.31 billion years and you take two of them day and night. That 8.6 something billion years is a one complete cycle. So when you think about your journey, this is, this is what is continue from day to night, day and night. It will continue from one state of existence to another, one state of existence to another. And if you think that you as the entity is not really happy about it, then there is escape hatch that is take refuge in me, refuge in me, identify with the source.\n\nTill we reach the state of that Brahmaj's loka, his world, the Creator's world. As long as I'm watching David Copperfield performing magic, it's wonderful to watch and get enchanted by it and then keep thinking, how does he do it? Till one day I show up when he is preparing for his show and say, I want to be your apprentice, sir. And he takes me and then he shows me and then I see how all these magics are done and then all magic is gone. Now I'm not confused. Now he's cutting the lady into half.\n\nI know exactly what he's doing. Till that time, I have to keep coming back. Till I eat the Brahma's Loka, the Creator's own world, I will be coming back into the same cycle. But then when I reach there and then identify with the source, then I will become one with that. So it gives us a scale. My quest in life to achieve happiness is not a short term, even though I put it in a short term goal and long term goals.\n\nBut in the end I want happiness. If you just extend that to Brahma, just day and night and now work towards your goal, that's the only way to achieve that is to identify with the source. Avyakta d vyaktayaha Sarvaha prabhavanti aha Agame. So all those things in beings with all their guna and Dharma are in dormant state. When Brahmaj is inactive, which we consider as a dissolution. Pralaya, Vishnu, lying in a Kshira, Shira, Samudra, milky ocean.\n\nThere are no vasanas, pure Sattva, then there is no activity. If it is pure Sattva, there is no activity. Rajas and Tamas has to be there. So when you are in a pure state of Sattva, there is no activity. But all other things in being there in dormant state. All the other thoughts are in dormant state.\n\nJust as when I go to sleep, all my thoughts about what I'm going to be doing next week are in dormant state. Not that I've forgotten anything about it. I'm just in dormant state. As soon as I wake up on Monday morning, we all come into being and becomes my work and my activity and my creation. Avyakta, vyaktaha, sarvaha prabhavanti ahaha made the arrival of the day. All those who were unmanifest now becomes manifest in all those who are manifest during the day.",
      "reflection": "Consider: If you were to die tonight, what would your final thoughts be? Not to create anxiety, but to clarify priorities. What matters most to you? Are you giving it the attention it deserves?\n\nPractice falling asleep tonight with awareness—watching the transition from waking to sleep as a small rehearsal for the larger letting go. The Gita teaches that our state of consciousness at death is shaped by our entire life. What are you cultivating?\n\nThink about where your mind goes in unguarded moments. This reveals what you truly value, and according to these teachings, points toward your future trajectory."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter eight, Imperishable Brahman. We are coming to the last concluding verses of this chapter. In chapter seven, we learned about the nature of the supreme as the Higher Prakriti and the Lower Prakriti. He said, my Lower Prakriti is Eightfold Prakriti which is manifest. My Higher Prakriti which supports this lower Prakriti. So that higher Prakriti is the imperishable Brahman, which is the substratum for this Lower Prakriti.\n\nThat which is manifest is supported by that which is Unmanifest. That Unmanifest is the Supreme Brahman, the Imperishable. So chapter eight is our quest to understand the imperishable Brahman. We've been discussing the nature of the Imperishable Brahman. In the beginning we have learned that the nature of that supreme reality is imperishable. He is self knowing and in his work is to create these things and beings.\n\nSame supreme reality creates these things and beings is Prakriti. As the Lower Prakriti out of his own self, so the world which we see is the manifest world, but it is supported by the Unmanifest. Unmanifest is imperishable, but the world which it creates is perishable. Prakriti is infinite, just as Brahman is infinite. Prakriti is ever existing, just as Brahman is ever existing. But the creations within Prakriti are perishable because the same entity which creates these things and beings will keep creating and destroying the Brahma, the Creator, while he is working, that's his day.\n\nWhen he's not working, that's his night. And we have seen that how long the Brahma's day is compared to hours. Then in the end we have talked about how can the individual ego, the individual entity which finds itself to be limited by these limitations of mind and intellectual, can rise above this limitations and reach the Supreme. Why I'm suffering through my limitations. And therefore there are Sorrows. If I was having no limitation, there will not be any sorrow.\n\nSo my quest in life is to get over all my limitations. So when I transit from one existence to another, my goal is always to get to a stage which has less limitations or no limitations. So we talked about the one who dies with that thought of imperishable in mind will lead the imperishable. One who dies with the goal of achieving something will get to that state of achievement. Those who worship Devas will go to Devas. Those who worship Brahman will go to Brahman.\n\nThen we elaborately discussed how to get to that point where we can think about that goal. So the verse 21, which was the last one we had discussed, it says, vyakta aksara ITI ukta tam ahuhu paramahamgapti. That which is considered the unmanifest, Imperishable is your highest goal. And they who reach it never again return. Yam prapyanna neverthanti. Everyone else has to come back because of some goal or other.\n\nSome desire or other which is unfulfilled. And I want to fulfill it. I want to achieve their capabilities and then achieve that goal. So to achieve that, now I'm in a pursuit of happiness. Because my happiness is somewhere else. I have to come back to pursue my happiness.\n\nBut one who wants to achieve that happiness which is supreme, then he doesn't have to come back. And therefore it says that your goal is to achieve that unmanifest and imperishable that is considered the highest goal. They who reach it never again return. Bhagwan says, that is my highest abode. That's what my my abode is. All this time we had been discussing and thinking about what is the nature of the Lord and where does he reside.\n\nNumber one says, that is my abode and that's my nature. My nature is supreme, imperishable, unmanifest. My abode is that state of awareness. That's where you will find me. So the next seven verses, which are the concluding verses, say, Purushasa partha bhaktiya labhyatu Ananya. Is it ever possible to achieve that state of achieving oneness with the imperishable Brahman?\n\nRight now I can achieve oneness with my own limitations that this is me. I can also relate to the other things in the world and achieve oneness. But it is unthinkable right now to achieve that oneness with the supreme imperishable brahman. The Bhagavan gives guarantee here that it is achievable by Bhaktiya labyadu Ananya by single pointed devotion. The single pointed devotion. The single pointed identification with that imperishable Brahman.\n\nAs long as I'm identified with something else, I cannot be identifying with that. As long as I'm identified with my body, my intellect there is no way that I can identify with him. So Bhagavan said, it is possible for Purusha, any person to achieve that by single pointed devotion. That's the only path.\n\nYasyantahasthani Bhutani. That single pointed devotion for what? That which is the indwelling for all beings. I am trying to achieve understanding about myself. But in that inward journey I have to realize that myself is not just limited to my limited self but it is the self of all the beings. Yesyanta sthani Bhutani.\n\nThat's the dwelling place for all the beings. Enam sarvam vidam tatam and everything is pervaded by it. That entity with which I want to identify which is the dwelling place for all the beings and things. With that single pointed devotion, I'm identifying with that. We can very easily identify with the people and things which are similar to me. We have difficulty identifying with people who are a little different than us.\n\nThey speak different language, they look different. It's a way I can overcome that. But then I have to identify with entire Jagat and it goes even beyond that and says there is nothing in this universe cosmos where the self is not pervaded. In my inward journey of meditation I have to understand and identify with that entity which does not leave anything out. If I say I love this, but I hate this, well, I have limited him. I created limitation for him and therefore my journey is incomplete.\n\nSo now Bhagavan said that I will explain to you how to reach there. And he said there are two paths. Yatra kale to anavrutyam avruttim chevayogina. Well, first qualification. You should be a Yogi.\n\nYou are the one who is striving to achieve this liberation that's given. But the striving alone will not guarantee that you will achieve liberation. Because the path you may take. They said that I will explain the time and path while parting from this state of existence. One which is the path of return and one path of no return. We had been trying, people had Been trying, but we continue to come back to the same world of sorrow.\n\nPrayatha Yanti Tamkalam Vakyami Bharata Sabah. So I will let you know what path will lead you to no return. I also let you know what the path of return. So that's basically just an introduction to the next two verses. Next is Agnihi Jyotihi Ahaha, Shuklaha Shanmasa, Uttarayanam Tatra, Prayahata, Gachanti, Brahma, Brahma Vidojanaha. These two mantas are very, very difficult to understand because from a superficial translation it makes no sense whatsoever.\n\nIt says that Agni Jyoti ahaha, Fire light, daytime, Shuklaha the bright fortnight in six months of Uttarayanam Tatra Prayatha. One who goes through that path, Gachanti Brahma, Brahma Vidojanaha. They go to the Brahman of no return. The Yogi who knows Brahman and who goes through this path of this light. So now as we have come to the conclusion, that means this six months people die. They have a chance to get liberated.\n\nOther six months have no chance. December 22, as seen as clarified to June 21 and after June 22 to December 21 people have to return. So that obviously makes no sense. Swamiji explains here that Gita, you have to remember the Gita is the essence of Upanishads. Sarva, Upanishado, Gavo Dugdha, Gopalanandanam. All Upanishads are cows.\n\nAnd Gopal Nandan has collected the milk and gave it to you. He's the one who collected all the ideas and concepts from Upanishads and put it in Bhagavad Gita. You have to know Upanishads. You have to study of Upanishads to understand this concept. These concepts are taken from Upanishads. These particular two verses of path of Uttarayan and Dakshinayan are directly taken from Pra Punishad Pra P. Nisad elaborately explains the path of Uttarayan and Daxinayan.\n\nIt starts with explaining the creation of this universe that Prajapati himself became the sun and the moon. The sun represents energy, Moon represents matter. Then it also explains how the year is created, how a month is created, how a day is created and one represent energy, other matter. Anything during day is represent energy. We know that during daytime is the domain of sun, the sunlight energy activity. Nighttime is presided by moon and its inactivity.\n\nDarkness that's the path of Moon. So the two paths were thought of as the path of energy and path of Matter. Path of Energy, path of Sun. So with the Karma Mukti, which is the gradual liberation by Pasana, by Karmas, you reach through the path of sun to the Brahmaloga. So we also talk about. You know that we can gradually improve ourselves.\n\nSo the good actions are necessary. But we also know that doing good is not good enough. It has to be associated with knowledge. So that is the difference between the two parts. One who is doing good but with a goal of getting something good out of it. And that the path of good and that the path of return.\n\nOne who is doing good but without gaining anything out of it, but to liberate himself that selfless actions that the path of no return. These two are symbolically and in the Upanishadic languages were described as Path of Uttarayana and path of Daksinayan. Other way also to look at it is when we face sun in the morning. You are facing east on your right side is south and and your left side is north. So path of Dakshinayana is sun is rising from the east, going from the south and setting in the west. It seems that the path of north is path of a rising sun.\n\nAnd path of south is a path of the setting sun. So we are going from the rising sun to the daytime, from setting sun to the night time. So if we associate the knowledge, the sacred to the path of rising sun, then the path of Uttarayan path of setting sun, which is the path of Dakshinayana. Both of this describes the mental makeup of a yogi. One who is seeking liberation, whether he is to come back and enjoy. If you listen to conventions, if you just look at how the nominee is described, it looks like they're sages.\n\nThey're only driven by the common good. They just wanted to do nothing but help people. So if that is true, then he's a sage. But if you take that and see that they are not only doing good, but they also have their own good in mind. They want to achieve something out of it. At the path of return, you're constantly coming back to do good so that you can get something out of it.\n\nBhagawan said for the yogi also exactly same. Pra Prade said very in detail describe that those who are the authority, those who want to gain something out of their good actions, they are on the path of return. And we have seen in earlier verses that in the time of Brahma's night All beings are in dormant state and when the creation starts they start from whatever the unfulfilled desires and come back in this universe again.",
      "reflection": "Consider: If you were to die tonight, what would your final thoughts be? Not to create anxiety, but to clarify priorities. What matters most to you? Are you giving it the attention it deserves?\n\nPractice falling asleep tonight with awareness—watching the transition from waking to sleep as a small rehearsal for the larger letting go. The Gita teaches that our state of consciousness at death is shaped by our entire life. What are you cultivating?\n\nThink about where your mind goes in unguarded moments.

      ],
      "commentary": "We have been discussing chapter eight and we are coming to the conclusion of chapter eight. Akshara Brahma Yoga, Yoga of Imperishable Brahman. So let's see what we have seen so far in Bhagavad Gita. We are almost at the midpoint of Bhagavad Gita. So the teachings in Bhagavad Gita is basically telling us that you are not this limited self and your real nature, supreme Self. The journey from this limited self to the supreme self is a quest of human life.\n\nSo Bhagavan has indicated in chapter one what this limited life is like using Arjuna's situation, that the life is not clearly divided between good and evil, or situations which are black and white, but they come in various shades of gray. And to learn to deal with it is the wisdom. So Bhagawan gave Arjuna the guidance and encapsulated that guidance in Bhagavad Gita for the generations to come, so that we can use the same guidance given to Arjuna for our own lives. So Bhagavan had given Arjuna in the second chapter, a clear indication of what is reality and what is superimposition on the reality. Bhagawan said, we consider ourselves to be mortal beings, but we are immortal beings identified with mortal bodies. This identification is creating all the confusion.\n\nSo the goal of life is to get rid of this ignorance about the supreme Self. Define a man of wisdom, Sthita Prajna, the one who has balanced his mind and he can see the situation clearly without getting tainted by the situation. So Bhagawan has given that wisdom in a nutshell to Arjuna. We learned that what we consider ourselves are not really ourselves. We are not limited beings. We are immortal beings identified with mortal bodies.\n\nBhagavan gave that advice to Arjuna, a man of wisdom. He sees this clearly because of the purification of his internal instrument, his antaratma, that the self is different than this body, mind and intellect, and the one who is not attached, who is desireless, he will achieve this wisdom. The path then given in the following chapters. How to act in this world without any desires or attachment. So chapter three gave us Karma Yoga gives simple indication that we have no control over the results of our actions. But we do have right to act.\n\nI have right to act, but I cannot anticipate a particular result. And therefore I should act without any anticipation or expectation that the simple first step the second step in chapter four, Bhagavan said that you should come to the understanding the self is not the Dua. You, the self that you call I is not participating in any activity. Activities are performed by the body, mind and intellect. The matter reacting with matter. But the self is not involved.\n\nAnd therefore in chapter five he says, you should give up sense of agency that I am the doer. The sense of doership that everything is happening at the body level, at the mind level, at the intellect level. But I is not involved. I am not doing anything. I is not participating in any of these activities. In chapter six then culminated in Dhyana Yoga, the Yoga of Meditation.\n\nThat how can I contemplate on the real self the thoughts of the same species, of the same type when we direct towards the goal is called meditation. The meditation is to constantly think about the Supreme Self that I am. My Atma is none other than the Paramatma that thought constantly is meditation. Bhagawan has defined meditation Path of meditation Techniques of meditation Chapter 6 the second segment of Bhagavad Gita, as we have discussed many times, is about the Supreme Self. First segment of Bhagavad Gita was about Tvam, part of Tattvamasi. The next six chapters are all about Tat, that supreme we define Tvam, which is right now identified as Little Ego.\n\nTat is the Supreme Self. And if I have to contemplate on that, I need to understand the nature of the supreme self. So in seventh chapter we learned the two aspects of that supreme reality. One is the lower Prakriti which is made of this Eightfold manifestation, Bhumi, Apahanalaha, Vayu Kam, that we can see perceived through our senses is the representation of that lower Prakriti other than this lower Prakriti. The Higher Prakriti which becomes the knower of this lower Prakriti, the self in us becomes the knower, is the unmanifest aspect of that self. Rahaban said, my real nature is beyond these two and that is veiled by Maya.\n\nThat real nature is not available to all of us because they are veiled by Maya. Bhagawan has defined that then Maya is the total conditioning of Ishwara. The total conditioning of Ishwara is Maya. And that Maya when operates in my level, it becomes ignorance avidy. So this Avidy is not letting me cross the Maya itself. So in Chapter 8, Bhagavan has given us the means to overcome this Maya.\n\nSo we have started this chapter 8 with clear definitions of all these terms we come across. So we have learned that the supreme reality is veiled by Maya. And this projection of the multitude of beings and multitude of realities in physical world is projected through Maya. In the very first verse, Arjuna asked question which basically defines all these terms for us. These Adi Yajna we want clarified for our understanding that if you want to contemplate on the supreme Self, then we need to understand the differentiation between Adhi Bhuta, Adhi Daiva and Brahman. So Brahman is the supreme reality, one without the second Adhibhuta is that perishable nature of the reality which we experience.\n\nAnd Adhi Daivam is my own Swabhava. When it operates through me, it becomes Adhi Devam. And Bhagawan in the end said that I alone is the Adi Yajnam. All the experiences which you experience at an individual level is experienced by none other than the supreme self. Because the Self is real. Everything else is nothing but superimposition on it.\n\nAnd therefore Bhagawan says that you must identify with this supreme Self to get over this Maya, this supreme position. In the discussion, what happens at the time of departure from this level of my existence? So we have seen that the two terms we have learned so far, Antakala and Prayanakala. Antakala is my preparation time. I have to prepare for this journey. This existence is limited which is given, but there will be another existence right after that.\n\nSo if I was not really satisfied with the existence that I am in, then I'm obviously looking for better existence next time. Bhagawan says, what could be? That better existence is dependent on how you prepare and how you end this existence. Whatever you are thinking at the time of your departure, that's the destination you will reach. So Bhagawan said, therefore you think about me all the time. That destination which will have the ultimate happiness that you are seeking.\n\nThat the world without sorrow, world without any limitations, world without any conditioning. And we have Seen that that world is only at the level of Brahman. So we have seen that all the Lokas up to the Brahma's world of repeated return. So that's called the path of repeated return. So we have seen that Maya, the prism of Maya, has three aspects, the Tamas, Rajas and Sattva. Any existence is nothing but a permutation combination of these three Gunas.\n\nIf I am at a level where Tamas is predominant, then I am at the level of complete ignorance. When I rise from that level to the next level, then obviously the Rajas increases and then Tamas reduces. If I rise even further, then the Sattva increases, Rajas diminishes and Tamas diminishes. I can go all the way up to the level of pure Sattva. But as long as I am in that Rajas and Tamas, then I have to come back to the level of existence which has beginning and end, which is a path of repeated return. But if one says there is a path which is of no return, which you have to cross this Prakriti, this Maya, when you cross this Prakriti, then there is no existence where you have to come back to this mortal existence which is called path of no return.\n\nThose two paths are described in last few verses. And the confusion obviously was, is there a particular time, is there a particular moment, Is there a particular method in which one can depart and this not return or return to this? And those two paths we had been discussing, which is Agnihi, Jyotihi, aha, Shuklaha, Sanmasa, Uttarayanam, Tatra, Prayata, Gachanti, Brahma, Brahma, Vido, Janaha. This path is called Devayana, the Divine path, path which leads me to no return. That the path of fire, light, daytime, bright fortnight, the six months of the northern solstice. Following this path, man who know Brahman go to Brahman, men who know Brahman, the wise people who acquired this knowledge.\n\nTherefore we are going through Gnana, Vignana, Yoga. Knowledge about my supreme self is Gnana. And applying it in my life to get over these limitations is Vignana. So Brahma says, the one who has applied this, he is following the bright path. And these are probably symbolically indicated in Upanishads or how our mind sees this world. So when our mind is cheerful, we associate with the bright and sunny atmosphere.\n\nSo there is a climate outside, there's a climate inside my mind. Those two are related to each other, but not really connected with each other. Climate outside may be very bright and sunny, but my mind inside may very gloomy. That will not let me enjoy the world outside. But if I can synchronize this, then obviously I can say that my mind is feeling the same atmosphere which is outside inside. And maybe that's what was indicated here.\n\nI can keep my mind in the same bright atmosphere of knowledge and then leave this existence. Then I will achieve the state of Brahman, Brahma, Vidojanaha. People who know Brahman will always be following this bright path. And one who knows Brahman, he obviously is not going to desire for anything less than Brahman. If I have known that I own a billion dollar trust fund somewhere, obviously I want to achieve that and not go for a smaller gain in life. So we have known this ultimate goal of achieving that state of imperishableness.\n\nThey will follow the path of Brahman so that the path was identified Uttarayanam or Devayanam. In the contrast to that, the path which we typically associate with is labeled as Dakshinayanam or Pitrayanam. So the path of ancestors or the southern path. That path in contrast to the previous one is the path followed by people who are not aware of the nature of Brahman, who are not realized that there is an existence without any conditioning. As we have said, the conditioning at my individual level is avidy. Avidya says ignorance about myself has created this conditioning by identification with body, mind and intellectual space.\n\nIdentifying with walls, floor and ceiling creates itself as a room space. I, the self, identifying this body, mind, intellect, created this Jiva as the limited entity existing in this pluralistic world. And when I leave this body, this existence, with that understanding only that I'm a limited being trying to achieve the higher standard of living, then I'll reach that stage. But when I exhaust my Punya, then I'll come back to start working at it again. That's basically the path of return. I have to work for 50 weeks for two weeks vacation.\n\nOnce two weeks vacation is over, I have to start working for another 50 weeks or for two more weeks of vacation.",

      "commentary": "We have been discussing chapter eight and we are coming to the conclusion of chapter eight. Akshara Brahma Yoga, Yoga of Imperishable Brahman. So let's see what we have seen so far in Bhagavad Gita. We are almost at the midpoint of Bhagavad Gita. So the teachings in Bhagavad Gita is basically telling us that you are not this limited self and your real nature, supreme Self. The journey from this limited self to the supreme self is a quest of human life.\n\nSo Bhagavan has indicated in chapter one what this limited life is like using Arjuna's situation, that the life is not clearly divided between good and evil, or situations which are black and white, but they come in various shades of gray. And to learn to deal with it is the wisdom. So Bhagawan gave Arjuna the guidance and encapsulated that guidance in Bhagavad Gita for the generations to come, so that we can use the same guidance given to Arjuna for our own lives. So Bhagavan had given Arjuna in the second chapter, a clear indication of what is reality and what is superimposition on the reality. Bhagawan said, we consider ourselves to be mortal beings, but we are immortal beings identified with mortal bodies. This identification is creating all the confusion.\n\nSo the goal of life is to get rid of this ignorance about the supreme Self. Define a man of wisdom, Sthita Prajna, the one who has balanced his mind and he can see the situation clearly without getting tainted by the situation. So Bhagawan has given that wisdom in a nutshell to Arjuna. We learned that what we consider ourselves are not really ourselves. We are not limited beings. We are immortal beings identified with mortal bodies.\n\nBhagavan gave that advice to Arjuna, a man of wisdom. He sees this clearly because of the purification of his internal instrument, his antaratma, that the self is different than this body, mind and intellect, and the one who is not attached, who is desireless, he will achieve this wisdom. The path then given in the following chapters. How to act in this world without any desires or attachment. So chapter three gave us Karma Yoga gives simple indication that we have no control over the results of our actions. But we do have right to act.\n\nI have right to act, but I cannot anticipate a particular result. And therefore I should act without any anticipation or expectation that the simple first step the second step in chapter four, Bhagavan said that you should come to the understanding the self is not the Dua. You, the self that you call I is not participating in any activity. Activities are performed by the body, mind and intellect. The matter reacting with matter. But the self is not involved.\n\nAnd therefore in chapter five he says, you should give up sense of agency that I am the doer. The sense of doership that everything is happening at the body level, at the mind level, at the intellect level. But I is not involved. I am not doing anything. I is not participating in any of these activities. In chapter six then culminated in Dhyana Yoga, the Yoga of Meditation.\n\nThat how can I contemplate on the real self the thoughts of the same species, of the same type when we direct towards the goal is called meditation. The meditation is to constantly think about the Supreme Self that I am. My Atma is none other than the Paramatma that thought constantly is meditation. Bhagawan has defined meditation Path of meditation Techniques of meditation Chapter 6 the second segment of Bhagavad Gita, as we have discussed many times, is about the Supreme Self. First segment of Bhagavad Gita was about Tvam, part of Tattvamasi. The next six chapters are all about Tat, that supreme we define Tvam, which is right now identified as Little Ego.\n\nTat is the Supreme Self. And if I have to contemplate on that, I need to understand the nature of the supreme self. So in seventh chapter we learned the two aspects of that supreme reality. One is the lower Prakriti which is made of this Eightfold manifestation, Bhumi, Apahanalaha, Vayu Kam, that we can see perceived through our senses is the representation of that lower Prakriti other than this lower Prakriti. The Higher Prakriti which becomes the knower of this lower Prakriti, the self in us becomes the knower, is the unmanifest aspect of that self. Rahaban said, my real nature is beyond these two and that is veiled by Maya.\n\nThat real nature is not available to all of us because they are veiled by Maya. Bhagawan has defined that then Maya is the total conditioning of Ishwara. The total conditioning of Ishwara is Maya. And that Maya when operates in my level, it becomes ignorance avidy. So this Avidy is not letting me cross the Maya itself. So in Chapter 8, Bhagavan has given us the means to overcome this Maya.\n\nSo we have started this chapter 8 with clear definitions of all these terms we come across. So we have learned that the supreme reality is veiled by Maya. And this projection of the multitude of beings and multitude of realities in physical world is projected through Maya. In the very first verse, Arjuna asked question which basically defines all these terms for us. These Adi Yajna we want clarified for our understanding that if you want to contemplate on the supreme Self, then we need to understand the differentiation between Adhi Bhuta, Adhi Daiva and Brahman. So Brahman is the supreme reality, one without the second Adhibhuta is that perishable nature of the reality which we experience.\n\nAnd Adhi Daivam is my own Swabhava. When it operates through me, it becomes Adhi Devam. And Bhagawan in the end said that I alone is the Adi Yajnam. All the experiences which you experience at an individual level is experienced by none other than the supreme self. Because the Self is real. Everything else is nothing but superimposition on it.\n\nAnd therefore Bhagawan says that you must identify with this supreme Self to get over this Maya, this supreme position. In the discussion, what happens at the time of departure from this level of my existence? So we have seen that the two terms we have learned so far, Antakala and Prayanakala. Antakala is my preparation time. I have to prepare for this journey. This existence is limited which is given, but there will be another existence right after that.\n\nSo if I was not really satisfied with the existence that I am in, then I'm obviously looking for better existence next time. Bhagawan says, what could be? That better existence is dependent on how you prepare and how you end this existence. Whatever you are thinking at the time of your departure, that's the destination you will reach. So Bhagawan said, therefore you think about me all the time. That destination which will have the ultimate happiness that you are seeking.\n\nThat the world without sorrow, world without any limitations, world without any conditioning. And we have Seen that that world is only at the level of Brahman. So we have seen that all the Lokas up to the Brahma's world of repeated return. So that's called the path of repeated return. So we have seen that Maya, the prism of Maya, has three aspects, the Tamas, Rajas and Sattva. Any existence is nothing but a permutation combination of these three Gunas.\n\nIf I am at a level where Tamas is predominant, then I am at the level of complete ignorance. When I rise from that level to the next level, then obviously the Rajas increases and then Tamas reduces. If I rise even further, then the Sattva increases, Rajas diminishes and Tamas diminishes. I can go all the way up to the level of pure Sattva. But as long as I am in that Rajas and Tamas, then I have to come back to the level of existence which has beginning and end, which is a path of repeated return. But if one says there is a path which is of no return, which you have to cross this Prakriti, this Maya, when you cross this Prakriti, then there is no existence where you have to come back to this mortal existence which is called path of no return.\n\nThose two paths are described in last few verses. And the confusion obviously was, is there a particular time, is there a particular moment, Is there a particular method in which one can depart and this not return or return to this? And those two paths we had been discussing, which is Agnihi, Jyotihi, aha, Shuklaha, Sanmasa, Uttarayanam, Tatra, Prayata, Gachanti, Brahma, Brahma, Vido, Janaha. This path is called Devayana, the Divine path, path which leads me to no return. That the path of fire, light, daytime, bright fortnight, the six months of the northern solstice. Following this path, man who know Brahman go to Brahman, men who know Brahman, the wise people who acquired this knowledge.\n\nTherefore we are going through Gnana, Vignana, Yoga. Knowledge about my supreme self is Gnana. And applying it in my life to get over these limitations is Vignana. So Brahma says, the one who has applied this, he is following the bright path. And these are probably symbolically indicated in Upanishads or how our mind sees this world. So when our mind is cheerful, we associate with the bright and sunny atmosphere.\n\nSo there is a climate outside, there's a climate inside my mind. Those two are related to each other, but not really connected with each other. Climate outside may be very bright and sunny, but my mind inside may very gloomy. That will not let me enjoy the world outside. But if I can synchronize this, then obviously I can say that my mind is feeling the same atmosphere which is outside inside. And maybe that's what was indicated here.\n\nI can keep my mind in the same bright atmosphere of knowledge and then leave this existence. Then I will achieve the state of Brahman, Brahma, Vidojanaha. People who know Brahman will always be following this bright path. And one who knows Brahman, he obviously is not going to desire for anything less than Brahman. If I have known that I own a billion dollar trust fund somewhere, obviously I want to achieve that and not go for a smaller gain in life. So we have known this ultimate goal of achieving that state of imperishableness.\n\nThey will follow the path of Brahman so that the path was identified Uttarayanam or Devayanam. In the contrast to that, the path which we typically associate with is labeled as Dakshinayanam or Pitrayanam. So the path of ancestors or the southern path. That path in contrast to the previous one is the path followed by people who are not aware of the nature of Brahman, who are not realized that there is an existence without any conditioning. As we have said, the conditioning at my individual level is avidy. Avidya says ignorance about myself has created this conditioning by identification with body, mind and intellectual space.\n\nIdentifying with walls, floor and ceiling creates itself as a room space. I, the self, identifying this body, mind, intellect, created this Jiva as the limited entity existing in this pluralistic world. And when I leave this body, this existence, with that understanding only that I'm a limited being trying to achieve the higher standard of living, then I'll reach that stage. But when I exhaust my Punya, then I'll come back to start working at it again. That's basically the path of return. I have to work for 50 weeks for two weeks vacation.\n\nOnce two weeks vacation is over, I have to start working for another 50 weeks or for two more weeks of vacation.",
      "reflection": "Consider: If you were to die tonight, what would your final thoughts be? Not to create anxiety, but to clarify priorities. What matters most to you? Are you giving it the attention it deserves?\n\nPractice falling asleep tonight with awareness—watching the transition from waking to sleep as a small rehearsal for the larger letting go. The Gita teaches that our state of consciousness at death is shaped by our entire life. What are you cultivating?\n\nThink about where your mind goes in unguarded moments. This reveals what you truly value, and according to these teachings, points toward your future trajectory."

      "commentary": "We have started discussing chapter nine, which is the Raja Vidya Rajaguhiya Yoga, the Yoga of the Royal Knowledge and Royal Secret. Obviously this is in continuation of what we have so far discussed in last two chapters of 7 and 8. In chapter 7 we have seen Gnana Vignana Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge, in Visishtha Gnana, which is applied knowledge or what we call wisdom. A typical call wisdom is something which we have gained a knowledge through our own experience that says, well, look at my gray hair. I didn't have this gray hair standing in the sun outside all this experience. In other words, what I have learned through my experience became my own knowledge.\n\nSomebody told me something that remained at the information level, then I applied it and it became my own knowledge. That's why in the science college you have theoretical classes and then you go to lab same thing which you Learned there, that H2O makes water. You go and experiment it out and yourself realize that's what happens. So the first thing we did after finishing the first six chapters, talking about who we are and how do we purify our internal instrument by meditation, by all these sadhanas, selfless actions. See now what are we meditating upon is what we need to know. So from chapter seven onward, we started talking about the self knowledge, knowledge about my own self, removing this paradox where I think this is me and still worrying about what happens to me after my death and what happened before my birth.\n\nSo the self knowledge, the Gnana Vignani Yoga says what is the nature of the Lord and how people approach it. In the first seven chapters there are Chaturvida Bhajan Taima. Everyone wants to achieve that state of perfect happiness where there is no sorrow, there is no imperfection in my life. In four ways we approach that. Our quest for that perfectness is it Arthaha Jignasu ar Tharati Nagnani. One who is approaching him out of his distress?\n\nOne is approaching because he wants to gain something out of this. One is approaching him because he is just Curious is there a state of perfectness? And the last one approaches him because he knows out of his own intuition he knows there is a state of perfectness. And then in the last chapter we say the imperishable Brahman. Yes, there is a state which is infinite, imperishable. And at that state of existence we call a Brahman that which pervades everywhere and everything.\n\nMy world right now is pervaded by my thoughts, you know, and my thoughts are right now limited. So my world is limited. I can think about the things only which I have experienced in the past, you know, or I heard about it from others or something which I have known from reading the books. But my thoughts are limited to that. Therefore my world is also limited to that. Therefore, beyond this world, I'm always afraid or curious.\n\nWhat is beyond my thoughts, what is? Before my birth I can think about my life as far as I can think in my childhood. I can think about my life in future. As far as I can think, I will live. So I had this guy who was trying to sell me annuity and said, you know this thing gives you lifetime income from whenever you start. And I said, when can I start?\n\nHe said, you can start age of 70. I said, my lifetime may not be more than five, six years after that. So your lifetime income doesn't do much for me. He said, why do you say that? I said, by statistical data. How many people in my family has lived beyond that?\n\nSo I know my future by what? By observing in my family what has happened. So what is beyond that? That's where I get lost. So Bhagavan said that imperishable Brahman is the state of yourself. So in chapter eight we have discussed about the nature of that imperishable Brahman and how I as this limited being fit into that.\n\nThat as long as I identify with this limited intellect in mind, this instrument of ego, I constantly come back and forth because I'm hanging on to that identity. This me is where I am as long as I have that ego. Bhagavan says in the part of your Prakriti, he'll come back again and again taking another instrument of transaction with this world continuing in the same argument. Now the chapter nine says, now we'll talk about the royal secret. Why it is royal secret? Because it is already obvious to you, but you are not aware of it.\n\nIt's right there, but I can see it. So therefore it's a Secret. And it's a royal science. Because Royal Rajan Raja connotes supremacy. In a kingdom there is nothing higher than a king. In our case we have precedent in the highest.\n\nBut he has many people to question him and tell him what he is not doing right. In those kingdom, Raja was never questioned. Even though he is not wearing clothes. Nobody says the king is not wearing clothes. There was a supreme, you know status. They say this Vidya is a Raja Vidya in the supreme knowledge.\n\nBeyond that there is nothing to be known. That is the self knowledge. I know physics, I know chemistry. I know all this thing. I know all the knowledge about arts and everything else. Bhag Bhagavan says there is only one thing you need to know about yourself.\n\nAnd there is nothing more to be known. Therefore it is the supreme knowledge in the self knowledge. So the first verse of this chapter starts with Bhagavan's profound statement. Idam tute gheeyatamam pravakshyami anasuya ve. I am going to tell you this. Gnanam Vignana sahitam yad Gnatva moksha Sai asubhat.\n\nI'm going to tell you this knowledge along with it Visishtagnam. Along with its wisdom, its application. Knowing that you will be freed from. You will be liberated from what? With this Ashuba Shubha auspicious that is good. Ashuba not good for me.\n\nAnything in your life which you consider not good, you'll be liberated from that. And we say, well, that's exactly what I was looking for all my life. Get rid of all the problems I have Bhagavan. Then I'll be doing your bhakti forever. Because right now I don't have time. Just fixing my problem.\n\nMy total attention after that. Bhagawan idam tut Guhiya. This knowledge which is the most deepest profound secret. Guhe Tamam Goya secret Tamam. I'm going to tell you. You know always what is the supreme secret.\n\nBut nobody can figure it out. That's a supreme secret. Other secrets you can figure out by asking him or that this secret is right in front of you. But can't figure it out. Person in disguise, you know. Walking around in a party you see in a movie.\n\nEverybody sees him but nobody figures out who he is. And he said, I'm going to tell you this. Because you're Anasuya ve, we have heard last time, you're a person who do not cavil or carp, who do not raise the petty argument or petty objections. Sometimes people come to lecture, they find out how smart the speaker is. See whether he knows anything. Then they will find fault in it.\n\nSee, if you give an example and say, you know, our life is short, but sun is there forever. And suddenly somebody says, well that's not true, sun is not there forever. I can tell you how it worked. But that was not the intention for the speaker to give that analogy. Give you a relationship. But because your purpose is only to see what the speaker does not know.\n\nSo you are carping at him, raising petty objections, petty arguments, petty faults, errors in that. Because you are not that you are truly, genuinely interested in understanding. So the person who is like that, he will obviously is not going to learn. Because his mind is not in learning things. His mind is in finding out where the faults lies. So therefore he says, I'm going to tell you this.\n\nThe deepest of the secret, the most profound of this secret. Because so far you have proved that you are a genuine seeker of this knowledge. You really want to find out how to get rid of the sorrows from your life. How can I readjust my thinking pattern so I can function right in this world? They see having known the Gnanam vignana Sahitam yad gnatva moksha se Asubhat. After that you will get rid of all that is asubh sorrowful, not conducive in your life.\n\nBhagwan, that's what I've been looking for. If you can tell me then after this once I know. Every time I buy a lottery, I'll be the winner. Every time I'll submit a proposal, I'll be the winner. Every time I put a contract on a property, I'll be the winner. Because you told me that after knowing this, there will not be any sorrow in your life.\n\nYou'll be just a winner. You'll never be a loser. Pakwan said, that's not what it means. What it means is after that you will not see anything that is happening in your life and around you. Right now, my definition of good and bad is defined by what I want and what I want to reject. Everything which I want to reject is Ashuba.\n\nEverything I want is Shubha. Father goes to two daughters. One was married to a pot maker. Another was married to a farmer, went to a daughter with a farmer and said, what's happening? Oh, this Was a wonderful season A lot of rains and we are doing very well oh Lord keep continuing doing that Goes to another daughter's house Married to part maker he said so how are things going? He said pretty bad this year there was no sun came out it was raining all the time we couldn't really bake any parts so we are really doing not good.\n\nHope Lord does something and stop this rain so father oh Lord please stop this rain so that my daughter will be happy what a father can do Same situation One sees as Shubha other sees as Asuba the Subha and Asubha as we are saying is the projection of our mind where we create this Shuba and Asuba in our life. Once I fix my perception of how to see the world I may not find anything Asu in it. There's this story in Mahabharata that Yudhishthir and Duryodhan both were under the same teacher so the teacher said I have one test for both of you so calls Yudhishthir first and go and find one bad person from this town Yudhishthir goes off called Duryodhan and said go and find one good person from this town After a while Yudhishthiri comes back and the teacher so where is the bad person I asked you to bring? He said I'm so sorry but I couldn't find anybody bad in this town and then Duryodhan comes back and says where is the good person I asked you to bring? He said I'm so sorry but I couldn't find any good person in this town. Both have a different way of looking at the world.\n\nOne cannot find anything bad in this world other cannot find anything good in this world. I right now have divided my world into good and bad because of my attachment, my desires, my aspirations of what I want to achieve When I achieve that great when I don't achieve that the world is falling apart. The Bhagavan said having known this knowledge there will not be Asura in your life.",
      "reflection": "The Gita promises that sincere, heartfelt offering is always received. Today, offer something simple—a leaf, a flower, a thought, a moment of gratitude—with your whole heart.\n\nDon't worry about getting it right. What matters is the quality of love behind the gesture, however imperfect. The Lord sees the heart, not the outer form.\n\nConsider: What would change if you truly believed that the supreme Reality is equally available to all, regardless of background, education, or social status? The Gita democratizes spirituality in a radical way."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter nine Rajavidy Rajaguhiya Yoga, the royal secret. In the royal knowledge we have obviously seen up to eight chapter in which we have learned about ourselves, who we are in this limited self, what is our goal and how we can evolve out of it. Then we say, but what do we meditate upon? What do we evolve into? Once we have said you have to evolve from this limited self, identifying with this limited being to the infinite self, unlimited being, and that's you. Meditate upon whatever we want to achieve, we meditate on that.\n\nBut unless I know what is the nature of that infinite self and what my relationship with that, how can I meditate upon? So in chapter eight we have seen imperishable Brahma, that entity which remains in existence all the time. Even when I perish or this world will perish, that substratum which creates this reality will always be there. So now the chapter nine says now what is my relationship with that imperishable Brahman? He is the source, he is the resting place. But what is my relationship with that?\n\nAnd so chapter nine says that is the royal secret. Right now I don't really see any relationship. Even though I heard through all these scriptures and books and religious. But I personally cannot feel any relationship with him. So what is my relationship? He said that is the royal secret.\n\nYou knowing yourself, do not know what your relationship with yourself is. That is the deepest secret or the most secret is it's right there. Looking for my key all the time. It's always in my pocket. That is the biggest secret. So that's the Raja Guhiyam then Raja Vidya.\n\nKnowing this, how to know this secret is the supreme knowledge. Once I realize my key is in my pocket that time I have the joy of my life. Up till now I was so worried about where is my key, I'm going to be late for my meeting and all of that. Suddenly I realized that right here, that is the greatest knowledge I can have at that moment. Anything else, you tell me at that time and say, well let me tell you. The E is equal to MC square.\n\nLook, I know I want my key. So when we get what we want to know is the supreme knowledge. So Bhagavan said, that's what I'm going to tell you in this chapter. So now in the first three verses he gave the promise. And now he says, let me tell you what that secret is. So in the verse four, you see and he says.\n\nMaya Tatum Idam Sarvam Jagat. Avyaktamurtha Mayatatam. I am pervading this Jagat. This entire Jagat, this entire cosmos, this entire universe is pervaded by me in my unmanifest form. That which is illuminated is Jagat. That which is illuminated by my senses.\n\nIn my Jagat, my Jagat is limited at that. That which I do not know, not part of my world. So Jagat is that which is illuminated by my senses is my Jagat. Your sense is your Jagat. What do you mean by her sense? So when everyone's Jagat, you put together.\n\nBhagawan said, I pervade in this entire Jagat whatever is illuminated by any being in this world. I pervade that in my unmanifest form. The manifest is something I can say, oh yeah, I have seen it. Oh yeah, I have touched it. Oh yeah, I have been there. But unmanifest is something is beyond my perception.\n\nSo Bhagavan said, this world of your perception is pervaded by me in my unmanifest form. Therefore you see the Jagat but do not see me. Because I'm unmanifest. But I'm always there in anything you perceive, See, touch, feel. Okay, here is where I decide. Here is my nature is that your entire Jagat is pervaded by me.\n\nIn my unmanifest form. That also includes myself. I can perceive, feel, touch. But one second then if that's part of your Jagat, I am pervading through that. In my unmanifest form, my mind, I can feel my thoughts. Well then I am pervading in that also in my unmanifest form, my intellect.\n\nSo then I'm also pervading the non manifest form. Matsthani Sarva Bhutani. At least we understood that that Bhagavan says that I am in unmanifest form. Whatever you think right there, his presence is there. As long as I can consider that as part of my Jagat, then Bhagavan is right there. So now I come to the conclusion.\n\nBhagavan resides in all of them. That's what all religions tell us. Bhagavan resides in you. The Lord resides in your heart. So you say, well, let's not get confused here. Okay, so what is my real nature?\n\nMatsthani, sarvabhutani, nacha aham te su avasthitaha. All these beings or things which you see, perceive, touch, feel as your Jagat, they reside in me, but I am not in them. See, in first line he said that I pervade in this entire Jagat of yours. In my unmanifest form, we put two and two together and said, therefore he is in all of them. No, I am not in them, they are in me. My standard example is I buy a car and take it from Chesterfield county and bring it to Hendrico County.\n\nAnd if Chesterfield county claims that the space in the car Mr. Batue bought was Chesterfield county space, Hendrico county. You can't keep it there. Now you have extra space in Hendrico County. Please return the extra space. You took it with your car to Chesterfield County. Can I return that space in my car to Chesterfield County?\n\nSo what happened to the space which was in my car when car was in the Chesterfield county, it remained in the Chesterfield County. When it came to Hendrigo county, even though car was still tight, the space in the car changed from Hendrik Chesterfield to Hendrik, where the car moved in the space. So now what the conundrum is, is the space in the car or is the car in this space? Obviously if I can return the space from Hendrik to Chester. Oh, here is the extra space. I. I brought it with me.\n\nWhen I brought the car, then obviously the car was moving in this space. So now the space can say all the cars are in me. But it says I am not in them. Now you have problem. There is no space in my car. So Bhagavan says, matsthani, sarva, Bhutani, all the things and beings you can think of.\n\nBecause your Jagat is what which I can perceive, feel, think and touch and feel is my Jagat. Now everything I see, Bhagavan says I pervade him that in unmanifest form. In other words, I am not limited to your Jagat. If I only say that Bhagavan pervades in the entire Jagat. I know my entire Jagat and Bhagavan is unmanifest form. Jagat is a manifest form.\n\nThe law of conservation says, in this world there is always the same amount of energy and matter. Whether it's in a form of a matter, form of energy. The total energy remains the same at any given time. So I can say, okay, the Bhagavan says he is unmanifest. So if I put sum it up, all the parts of my Jagat I know the Bhagavan. I say, no, they are in me, but I am not in them.\n\nI am something beyond that. So he said, what is that relationship then? So Swamiji explains here is that it's a relationship less relations. Just as the space in the car and the space outside. There's really no relationship to the car. It's not because the car is here.\n\nThere is a space here. The car will move, the space will move. With is my perception that the space is in the car. Space was always here outside this door. When I brought my car and parked it, I perceived that space is in my car. Space never moved from anywhere to anywhere.\n\nIn a similar way, the classical example we learn in Vedanta is that of a snake and a rope. The existence of snake is very real. Is part of my Jagat, my world. When I see a snake, I perceive it. I can vouch for it that there is a snake here. And therefore it is part of my Jagat.\n\nNow Bhagavan said, in unmanifest form, the rope was existing while I was seeing the snake in it. That snake could not have come in existence without the existence of the rope. So now rope can say that I was always pervading through this entire snake in my unmanifest form while you were seeing the snake in me. However, so therefore the snake is in me. But I as the rope is not in the snake. Rope has no relationship to the snake whatsoever.\n\nSnake cannot exist without that rope. But it takes the support of my ignorance, my perception. My perception created snake in my Jagat in my world. Because Jagat is only limited by my perception. That which I can illumine as world of plurality is my Jagat. Snake was part of my Jagat.\n\nWithout the rope, the snake could not have existed. And therefore rope was existing in its unmanifest form in the snake all the time. But it was never in the snake. Bhagavan said, all these beings are existing in me. In other words, without my existence, there is no existence for anything. Therefore they are in me.\n\nBut I, in my pristine nature, unlimited, formless, was never in any of these shapes and forms and colors which you see. So the next verse, if you think that we got it all. Nachamattani Bhutani, Pashyame, Yoga, Maishvaram, Bhruta, Bunacha, Bhutasthah, Mamatma Bhuta, Bhavanaha. Now he said that all these being exist in me because we have seen the snake exist in the rope. But the rope is not existing in the snake. So now you say okay, Nachamastni Bhutani.\n\nBut these beings are also not existing in me. Beings which I am perceiving, seeing and touching and feeling is part of my Jagat. But the Brahman who is pervading all this Jagat, he has nothing to do with that. The snake which was existing in the rope, the rope can say it existed in me, but I am not in them. But now he says, now if we, if we now got it correct and say okay, so snake was always in the rope. I said, no Nachamastani Bhutani.\n\nEven though these beings are existing in me, there was never a time from the perspective of the one who knew the rope, that the snake was existing in that rope. There was no snake in my world there was a snake. But the next guy standing with his torchlight, or at least he knew that's a rope for him. There was no snake in my Jagat, there was a snake. The snake was only possible because of the rope. From his perspective, there was no snake ever in the rope.\n\nSo in reality there is never a snake existing in the rope. Rope remained rope all the time before I created the snake in it and after I realized there is no snake. Therefore Bhagawan says, in your Jagat, you create this world in your perception. You create this world of plurality. I exist and you exist. And she exists and he exists.\n\nAnd now I said, I am the center of my universe. The world revolves around me. You are in the center of your universe and the world revolves around you. So from my perspective, in my Jagat, beings exist. Because the Supreme Being exist. And that being pervades through all the beings in my Jagat.",

      "commentary": "We have been discussing chapter nine, Rajavidya Raja Guya Yogunan. So far we have seen that Bhagavan has indicated the relationless relationship of Jiva, Jagat and Paramatma. That's basically what the topic of this discussion Bhagawan started. So we are aware of our relationship with the Jiva to the Jagat, that I consider myself to be independent of the Jagat, the world. So the world I consider is an object, something other than me. But we still do not have any inkling about what our relationship with the Paramatma is.\n\nThe all pervading being. So Bhagawan clarified in the first six verses which we have seen that his relationship to the Jagat is relationless relationship. So first he said, I am not in them, they are in me. So the first conception we have from our childhood, learning from other teachers, religions that Bhagavan is within me, but I do not know who that Bhagavan is. Bhagavan clarified that I am not in them, I am not in the beings. So the first paradigm shift here is Bhagawan is saying I am not in them.\n\nThe next thing he says is that they are in me. I pervade this entire Jagat Jagat which I can imagine and perceive in its infinity. Bhagawan said I am that infinite Jagat and all beings are in the Jagat. I am not in it, but it is in me. So Brahman Paramatma is the fundamental. Everything is an emergent reality.\n\nThe Jagat is emerging out of Paramatma, Jiva is emerging out of Jagat. So he clarified this relationship that I am fundamental, Jagat and Jivas are within me. But then he clarifies further saying but in reality, even they are not in me. So first we are conceived as the wind in the space, that the space is all pervading and infinite. From our perspective, the wind is finite and moving around within the space. In the same way all other elements which we see below, space, air, fire, water, earth, they're within space.\n\nSo space Is substratum for all things and beings to be in. That's our normal perception. The space is all pervading. Everything is within the space. Now Bhagavan is saying that he is beyond space and time. The Jagat is bound by space and time.\n\nBhagavan says, I am beyond space and time. So the Bhagavan is fundamental, infinite, all pervading, unchanging. Jagat is bound by space and time. And therefore it is changing, but is constantly changing with time. So the conundrum is, if the Jagat and Jiva came out of Brahman, the supreme reality, how did Brahman change? Where I see the manifest Jagat, which is the manifest Prakriti, which came out of Brahman, which is unmanifest.\n\nHow did the unmanifest became manifest is the riddle we have to solve. So Bhagavan said, even they are not in me. It makes it clear that the Jiva and Jagat are apparent reality are not the fundamental reality. Because they appear to be in me. But you see, they are also actually not in me. In other words, they appear to be in me.\n\nAnd therefore we use this analogy of snake and rope. So that's the only way the two things can exist in the same state of manifest and unmanifest at the same time. Rope is unmanifest to the one who is afraid of snake. But someone who is aware of the rope, for him, the snake is not there. So these two are related, but have no real relationship. Snake and rope are related because without rope, the snake cannot exist.\n\nBut snake has no real reality other than the observer is creating this reality. You remove the observer, the snake and rope dichotomy goes away. So this Jagat and Jiva, which I see as two realities, the Bhagavan said that they do not really exist. Are created by my observations. It's my mind which projects the space and time. Space and time are concepts of my mind.\n\nWhen I am not aware of myself. In deep sleep, neither space nor time exists. So when you wake up, only then you can say, nice sleep. But how long did I sleep? I will have no idea unless I look at the watch or clock. And so I went to sleep at such and such time, woke up at such and such time.\n\nSo I infer that I slept for as many hours. But a deep sleeper has no sense of time or space. So the Bhagavan said, jiva and Jagat are the conceptions of mind. But I, in reality is pristine without any change. But then Jeevan Jagat are very real for us. How do they come into existence?\n\nBhagawan now explains in the following verses. Sarvabhutani, Kaunteya, Prakrutim, Yanti, Mami kam, Kalpakshaye, Punastha, Kalpadav, Vishrajami aham. At the end of the Kalpa all beings Sarva Bhutani. We see in the Prakriti they come back to my original nature. Prakriti we discussed last time is the fundamental manifest reality also called Hiranyagarbha. We also called Ishvara.\n\nSo Brahman with Maya is Ishvara. Brahman is the efficient cause. Maya is the material cause. Maya provides this material to create this Jagat. So this Maya is the fundamental Prakriti. From that fundamental Prakriti, the Prakriti which I see as pluralistic manifestation comes into existence.\n\nThis plurality goes back into that singular Prakriti at the end of Kalpa. We learned in last chapter that Brahmaji is one day is one Kalpa. Brahmaji is one day is 1000 Maha Yugas. One Mahayuga has four Yugas, Sathya, Treta, Dwapur and Kali. And we have calculated the one Kalpa is 4.3 billion years. So here Bhagavan says there is one cycle of creation.\n\nThe another cycle of dissolution is Brahmaj's night, which is equally as long as 4.3 billion years. The Bhagawan said, I create this Jagat at the beginning of my day and all that comes back to its original state at the end of the Kalpa. So the creation goes to the evolution as we perceive in our scientific observations. In our modern day, the universe came into existence, the Big Bang. It continues to expand, it continues to evolve, and at some point of time it will go back to its original state. Bhagavad said Sarvabhutani, all beings in this Jagat, Prakrutim, Yanthi, Mamikam, Kalpakshaya.\n\nAt the end of Kalpa they all come back to me in my Prakriti. Punahatani, Kalpada, visra jami aham. I recreate them at the beginning of the next Kalpa, which is very similar to when I go to sleep every night I have all these ideas during the day I have all the goals during my days I have to do list. All during my day I go to sleep. All those ideas are folded back into my consciousness When I go to sleep when I'm in deep sleep. I don't really feel anything.\n\nI have no to do list, no idea what I need to become, what I need to acquire what I already accomplished. All those ideas in dormant state when I'm sleeping the next morning when I wake up, exactly those same ideas will create my new day. So I went to sleep as an architect. I wake up as an architect. A doctor who went to sleep as a doctor wakes up the doctor. My problems yesterday unresolved.\n\nThey're still unresolved today. So we start from where we left off last night. Bhagavan said here in the case of the Srishti, at the individual level, my world starts at the beginning of the day or ends when I go to sleep at night. At the Samasthi level. At the end of Kalpa, the whole world goes to sleep. But all those Vasanas tendencies of all the beings are in a dormant state.\n\nThe new Kalpa will start with the old Kalpa. So nothing really changes. When the new Kalpa starts, the same cycle will start all over again. And so Bhagavan said, Prakrutim swam Avastabhya Vishrujami Puna Puna. This is unending cycle. The Brahmaji wakes up one day and then goes to sleep.\n\nAnd then we are done with it. Brahmaji's life is considered hundred years. One day and one night we see his two Kalpas. Now you have to put his hundred years. That Brahma then gets liberation Moksha. The new Brahma takes over.\n\nThe new cycle starts all over again. So this is unending creation. My world comes out of my ideas and it dissolves into my nothingness. When I go to deep sleep, when I wake up, it starts all over again. This happens all throughout my life. When I die, everything gets merged into tendencies.\n\nI will have no memory of my experiences. But I'll carry that fragrance with me of what I have experienced in this life which will be the beginning of my next life. At an individual level, Brahma's level, the entire Srushti is in that state. Bhagavan said, you can visualize this entire Jagat as your own self. Just as you're visualizing yourself right now is a limited being. Otherwise Bhuta Gramma Inam Krishnam Avasam Prakrutehe Avashat.\n\nThis cycle continues perpetually. Because Brahman is beyond time. The time does not exist for us. Time exists because we are perceiving events in space. The time is an interval between two events. If you remove all events, there is no time.\n\nIf I don't experience anything, there is no time. But I experience one event, then a second event. This interval becomes time. This Bhuta, grammam, Krishnam, this entire group of beings, Avasham, without any choice, as long as I have a tendency, I'm going to manifest that tendency. If I have desire, I'll act according to that desire. Vishrujami pristam, Avasam Prakrute, Avashat.\n\nBecause they are under the spell of Prakriti, the Maya. Therefore they do not have any choice but to act according to their own tendencies and vasanas. All beings are propelled to act according to their swadharma, according to their makeup of their own vasanas and desires. Even when they go into dormant state, those vasanas and desires remain in dormant state. When you wake up, those vasanas and desires come back again. And this cycle continues perpetually unless you get out of this cycle of becoming and doing.\n\nNow the question Bhagavan answers here is whether that affects Brahman. Because he is the propeller, he is the prompter. He is the supporter of all this activity which is happening perpetually. Creation dissolution is continuing. Creation dissolution cannot happen without the presence of Brahman. My day and my night and my activity cannot happen unless I'm conscious of it.\n\nAs long as my consciousness is there, there will be day for me. There is a waking state for me. The dream state for me, deeply state for me. Question is, is my consciousness getting affected by my experiences at an individual level? At this Samasthi level, does Brahman get affected by these happenings? So Bhagavan clarifies in this verse Nachyamam Tani Karmani, Nibadnandi.\n\nThese actions of creation and dissolution which is only possible because I, the Supreme Consciousness is supporting it by using Maya. But the Maya is Brahma Shraya. It is supported by Brahman. There is no magician. You have to have magician to create magic. So that magic is supported by magician.\n\nThis Maya is supported by Brahman. But Brahman uses that Maya as the material to create this Jagat. Just as in my dream state, I create the experiences of my waking state as the material to create my dreams. No matter how weird a dream is, it is never based on something which you have not experienced before. It may be jumbled up of all the experiences. But all my dreams are based on my experiences, not on anybody else's experiences.\n\nSo Brahman creating this Maya as the material, creating this Jagat and then dissolving this Jagat into Prakriti again remain in its pristine state, unaffected by individual actions.",

      "commentary": "We have been discussing chapter nine and what we have learned is that Bhagavan said, I am the source of all the things, all the beings, everything that you see, I am the source and I am also the final resting place for all things. Things come out of me and they will rush back into me. There is nothing really that can exist without me. As we said in that classical example that a ghost cannot exist without the post. So from the post point of view, post can say the ghost came out of me. And once you realize there is no ghost, is also goes back into me.\n\nAt any given time the ghost has no modifications or it never changed into ghost. But my ignorance and my perception has created this perception of a ghost. In a similar way, Bhagavan says from me the whole Prakriti comes into existence. This world of plurality as you see, is because of my existence. If I'm not there, there is no world of plurality. This world as we know is I.\n\nAnd the world only exists because the fundamental basic reality is the self. I know I exist because of myself. You know you exist because of yourself. She knows she exists because of herself. But we think these are different selves. Bhagavan says it's just me, myself reflecting through all of them.\n\nBut we don't recognize it because of Moga Asha, but of vain desires that I am the center of my universe. The world needs to revolve around my desires. I want things to be like this. I want the world to be like this. I want market to do this. When I invest, therefore we do the wrong actions.\n\nBecause I have now considered this limited being as me. Now I have my false desires. We know we have very little power how things work in this world. But when we act, we forget that we know that even I can buy a gallon of milk. If so many people do so many things to bring that gallon of milk into your nearest martins or food line, then only you can go and buy. But I think that If I have $4 in my pocket, I'm the king and can buy that Milk that Moga Asana create this false notion that I am in control.\n\nAnd Bhagavan says Moga gnana viche dashaha because of this false knowledge that this is me and I can change this world as I want creates this false notion of my control. Rakshasim Asuram Shaiva. These people are of the nature of Rakshasa and Asura. Rakshasa is one who is predominated by that Rajasic nature. We have seen in Vedanta that there is nothing can exist in this world of time and space if it does not have these three qualities of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. Fundamental classifications of what are the basic qualities.\n\nFor any effect to exist in time and space, you need to have the Sattva, which is that awareness that this exists. The activity, the intense activity we see at the atomic level, subatomic level, or even at the level of our that it exists. And then Tamasa, the inertia for the thing to remain in its state as long as it can till the other force changes it to a different. He said that one with the most Rajasic predominance are the Rakshasas because they consider that this activity of theirs will give them the control over their world. And the Asuras are the Tamasic, the one with the predominant quality, which is Tamas. They rely on the inertia.\n\nIf I don't do anything, things won't change. Let's keep things as is, don't change it. Not realizing the nature of this world is Samsara. Constantly changing is Samsar. In that Samsara I try to keep things inert as is say the nature of Asura. These two qualities makes us forget the real nature of the self.\n\nIn contrast to that Mahatman, Asthmampartha, Devim, Prakruti, Mahasritaha. But the other group of people who do not fall into these two group of people who are Rajasic and Tamasic. And they are constantly interested only this existence. As I see the material existence, my physical existence and say my goal of life is to maintain this existence and have as much pleasure for this world as possible. Not realizing that this is a temporary existence in time and space. But my real existence is infinite, permanent, immutable or in the nature of the self.\n\nThe other group of people who are Mahatma, they are great souls simply because they will realize the nature of the self. So say Mahatma, Nastama, Partha, Divim, Prakriti, Mahasridah. Because they are taken Refuge into the divine nature of the self, which is to recognize the Sattva, the truth, that eternal truth which does not change with time. Everything in this world is relative truth. Somebody says, what is it? I say, it's a day outside.\n\nWell, that's a relative truth. It was not true at 4 o' clock in the morning. It will not be true at 8 o' clock at night. It is true only now in this time. So it's called a relative truth. But the truth which remains constant in any period of time is called Sattva, which I can say it was this 150 years ago.\n\nIt is now and it will be for eternity. That's the universal truth, the Sattva. Those who take taken refuge into this awareness of that immutable truth which is the nature of the self. My self is not this limited being which has started its life on day one time. When I was born and I'll die is time T2. And I want to make the most out of this life.\n\nBetween this span of T1 and T2 are those Asuras and Rakshasana. One who says, well, this is just a flicker in my existence. My existence is infinite before, will be infinite after. I want to achieve that sense back, not get bogged down with this limited being. The great souls, they identified not with the limited self, but with the higher self. Is the example I have used many times because I'm an architect.\n\nThe space in this room is a conditioned space. Right now my association with this space is room space conditioned by these walls and floor and ceiling. But I also recognize that this space is universal space. It is here and it will be here. Whether this building will be there or not. The one who recognizes the myself will always be here with his body is there, mind is there or intellect is there or not.\n\nThey are the great soul. Therefore they have taken refuge in the Devimprakrati. This Sattva, predominantly Sattvic in nature. They recognize the ultimate truth about their own self. Bajanti, Ananya, Manasaha. Therefore they devote themselves to me with a single pointed mind.\n\nNow obviously there are word connotations come from our own experience in life. Bhajanti, with that kirtan, kirtal and all that you know, Bhajanti, Ananya, Manasaha, Satatam. So constantly they are. But that's not possible. But we know that the vedantic connotation word Bhajanti means love. For divine is devotion Love is nothing but identification.\n\nMore I identify with someone, My love increases. More I identify with the divine. So Ananya Manasaha without any other thought. Without any other thought that this is me. I'm not an architect, I'm not a father, I'm not a son. All these are superimposition on me.\n\nAmitabh Bachchan never forgets when he does the coolie. He knows he is Amitabh Bachchan. Never ever he forgets while doing all these roles he plays. I do play all these roles. But I forget and I get identified with it. And I get carried away with it.\n\nMahatma never gets carried away. So bhajantim Ananya Manasaha Gnatva Bhut adim avyam. Knowing that I am the source of all the beings imperishable. We typically see that the source get destroyed into you take a seed and seed becomes a tree. The seed is no more there. Now I can say, okay, now I want the seed back.\n\nThat's a perishable source of the tree. Bhagavan said, but I am the source of this universe. All the being but imperishable never get destroyed. Because the creation is a Maya Post never became ghost. Therefore it never had to go into any transformation into something else. So once you see the ghost, post doesn't go away.\n\nIt remains exactly what it was before. Bhagavan says, knowing that I am the immutable, imperishable source of all the beings. These Mahatmas wants to get back to their original self. At the immutable, imperishable self. They drop the identification with the limited. Playing this part very efficiently in this world.\n\nBut always the identification is with the higher self. Just as Amitabh Bachchan never forgets in Amitabh Bachchan. But he is a coolie at the time. You know, say, Satatam Kirtayantah maam Yatan taschadiravratah. So now what will be my attitude once I have recognized that this limited being is not me. This life is just a part I am playing for the time being.\n\nBefore I was born, I existed as the universal being. After that all existed as a universal being. Before this building was built, this space was here. And I can vouch for it because I live here long enough. Long before this building was here, this space was here. After the building is built, there's room spaces here.\n\nAnd someday somebody will decide we can do better use of this land. And the building will be gone, but the space will be here. I am here, I was here and I will be here. That's the eternal truth. Bhagavan says Satatam Kirtayantah. Having known this, so what will be my actions?\n\nSatatam constantly Kirtayantaha. I am singing the glory of that eternal self that I am my Lord, who functions through me as this limited being. Swamiji obviously said kirtan du Visival. We have a bhajan, you know, next week. So that's the kirtan. That's the only time we do kirtan Bhajan and kirtan Swamiji.\n\nThis song with equally crude and noisy instrument. Only for that time, for your mind to occupy that has its own place. Because at least that time my mind is focused into those songs and the verses and what it means at that time. It is I'm not thinking. And those who do any kind of art or they. That mind has to occupy with something.\n\nAnd if it doesn't occupy, then it wanders away. One whose mind is constantly attached to that understanding that I am not this limited self, this universal self is manifesting in this world. There is nothing that can exist in this world without Him. And therefore there is no existence for anything else other than that. If God is all pervading, where are we? If we are here, then he is limited.\n\nHe cannot be all pervading. So if he is all pervading, there is no place for anyone else. All that I see is nothing but his manifestations. So now that constantly when I see anything in this world, the thought at the back of my mind says, that is nothing but the Lord's manifestation. Whether that is good, bad or ugly. See, we have no problem.\n\nWe see something very beautiful, nice and divine. That's God's manifestation. Early morning sun rises and we see O God. When the dark and evil we see and still see his presence in Him. That's where I'll be. Then my Kirtan Bhagavan says it's complete no matter what it is.\n\nI know he pervades the entire universe and all the happenings. There is nothing other than him can exist and therefore there cannot be anything if there is anything other than Him.",

      "commentary": "We have been discussing chapter nine, Rajavidy Rajagohya Yoga. Yoga of Supreme Knowledge and Supreme Secret. So far we have seen the Bhagavan has revealed the supreme secret that I pervade everything in this Jagat. And this Jagat is supported by my Maya, my association with Prakruti. Prakruti produces all that is moving and unmoving. But I am not in the Prakriti.\n\nI am not in the beings in the Prakriti. Those beings are in me. I am not in the Jagat, but Jagat is in me. In other words, my self supports the perception of the Jagat. So the Jagat exists as long as I perceive it. This world exists for me as long as I am conscious of it.\n\nWhen I'm not conscious of this Jagat, then this Jagat does not exist for me. The same way from the Supreme Consciousness. As long as that Supreme Consciousness is aware of the Jagat, that Jagat exists. And therefore Bhagavan says that I am not in the Jagat, Jagat is in me. But then he also said that they are also not in me. The beings and things in this Jagat are also not in me.\n\nIn other words, the Jagat and the things and beings which I see in the Prakriti, they are not in the consciousness. The consciousness is not affected by this perceptions of the world outside. So Bhagawan created contradictory statements for us to understand. Relationless relationship with Bhagavan. We are related to Bhagavan, as close to him as we are to our own selves. Because this world is created out of Bhagavan's own self.\n\nTherefore I cannot be further away from him than I am from my own self. And that's the secret which is the Supreme Secret. Even though I am as close to him as I am to my own self. But I never feel his presence. So Bhagawan said, to feel my presence you have to identify with me. People who do not identify with me.\n\nBhagawan is explaining in last verse, 12 he says Moga Asa, Mogha Karmanaha, Moga Gnana Vicheta sah. This is the reason why we are not experiencing his presence. Because we are distracted by our vain desires. Those desires prompt us to do vain actions. Because of our vain knowledge who we are, we consider this body, this mind, this intellect is to be me, this limited being to be me. I'm driven by my Rajasic and Tamasic tendencies.\n\nAs we have seen, this Maya is the root cause of the production of this Jagat. Jagat comes into existence out of Maya. Maya has three qualities. Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. Therefore everything in this Prakriti. Prakriti is nothing but the representation of Maya to us.\n\nSo everything in this Prakriti has those three qualities, Satvarajas and Dhammas. Awareness, activity and inertia. To exist in space and time, it has to have activity and inertia. And Sattva is the awareness part of it. So everything in this Jagat has these three qualities. The permutation combination of these three qualities makes this plurality that we see like in a three color printing.\n\nThere are only three colors, but it creates myriads of shades of color. So we can create all kinds of pictures from the combination of those three colors. The same way this Prakriti produces variety of things and beings by permutation combination of these three. Gunas Bhagavan said those people up to the level of human beings. People are just living by their instincts. All animals and plants and all aquatic life, they survive in the lap of Mother Nature.\n\nThey are aware of their own existence. But they are not aware of any other higher entity. Human beings are the only ones who have intellect. To realize that there got to be somebody higher than me, somebody greater than me to have the control over this world. Having that understanding, I still don't identify with him. Because this Rajas and Tamas dominated.\n\nSo Tattva is subdued by Rajas and Tamas. Then all my actions will be driven by those Rajasic and Asuric tendencies. The Rajasic and Asuric tendencies tell me that my happiness lies in this world out there. Therefore all my efforts to achieve that happiness which is my true nature. Just like water seeks its own nature, happiness is our true nature. So we constantly seek bliss and happiness.\n\nAnd therefore we work in the world outside. We never complain about why I'm feeling good today. We always complain I'm not feeling good. Today because being good is my nature, being not feeling good is not my nature. Bhavagan said, you are not recognizing your nature because of your wrong knowledge about yourself. Mogagnana because of the wrong knowledge, we cheta s my thinking is wrong of where my happiness lies.\n\nI'm working outside in a Rajasic manner to acquire things, to achieve things, to get happiness. And then I say, if I don't do anything, then I'll be happy. That asuric tendency, because of these two aspects of my nature, which is predominantly Rajasingh and Asuric, I'm not identifying with him. Bhagavan said that when I take the human form, people do not recognize me and they avoid me, ignore me. So we know everything about our own self, other beings, but we don't know about the divinity which is common in all of us. The consciousness which is the common factor, which is the one thread which ties everything together in this universe.\n\nSo therefore Bhagawan says Rakshasim, Asuram, Cheva, Prakrutim, Mohinim, Sritaha. By the nature of this Rajasic and Asharik Prakruti, they are confused about their own self. They're confused about the divinity in all human beings. Contrast to them Mahatmanastmampartha, Devim, Parkuti, mastritah. But in this path of evolution, everything evolves from Tamas to Sattva. So even in our evolution of our planet we obviously can think about first there was nothing but just inert matter.\n\nThen came the organic life. Then gradually it evolved into more complex life, more intelligent life. So everything evolves from inertia to knowledge, from Tamas to Sattva. Some are in the path of evolution at Tamasic level, but they are on the path of their own evolution. So next step is Rajas to be Rajasic. So in our self unfoldment, Swamiji says that when you introspect and see what you find, if you find Tamasic quality, then replace it by Rajasic quality.\n\nIf you find Rajasic tendencies, replace them by Sattvic tendencies. So this is a conscious effort. As a human being, we have our freedom to choose how to behave. So Bhagavan said, those Mahatmas who have evolved to Sattva, even Mahatma has Rajasic and Tamasic tendencies. But they're subdued by Sattvic tendencies. In other cases, the Rajasic tendencies are subduing the Sattvic tendency.\n\nHere the Sattvic tendencies are subduing the Rajasic tendencies and Tamasic tendencies. The devim Prakriti Mastritah so the Sattvik is considered the Devi divine quality. Closer to the reality. Devima Mastritaha Bhajantim Ananya Manasaha Knowing fully well that I am not this bundle of matter. I'm not this mind, this intellect. Even though I'm pulled by the tendencies of body, tendencies of mind, tendencies of intellect.\n\nI'm constantly reminding myself I'm part of this all pervading consciousness. My consciousness is same as consciousness in all other being. Bhajanti Ananya Manasa not having any other thought. Even though I'm functioning in the world like everybody else. But that thought is constant in my mind that I am the divine being at the core of my being. I am that supreme self, the all pervading consciousness.\n\nKnowing that Gnatva Bhuta dim avyam I am part of that immutable self which is all pervading. So we have discussed this example before. The space in my car or my car is in this space. The car is in the space. Space is not in the car. The space seems divided in different cars in different rooms.\n\nBut it is not really divided. Otherwise the car cannot move in the space and have Hendricko space. When it is in Hendricko Hanover space when it's in Hanover County. Bhuta Dim Gnatva Bhuta Dim avyam the self in me and self in you. They are not two divided selves. The self in all the being.\n\nThe consciousness which makes the entire Jagat possible is undivided. It's not that my consciousness is different than your consciousness. Your equipment, my equipment are different. And therefore our manifest representations are different. So Bhagavan says Mahatma. One who has evolved to that level of understanding that the self is undivided and all beings are existing in that consciousness.\n\nBhajanti Ananyamanah he devotes himself to me without any other thought, constantly with a single pointed devotion. There is no other doubt. There is no other identification. Even though he realizes that he is an individual functioning as this body, mind, intellect. But that is only possible because the consciousness functioning. We know this body is inert because we have seen dead bodies.\n\nDead body cannot function when the consciousness is not there. Therefore we come to the conclusion that the body is inert. Body is nothing but made up of food which I have eaten all my life. But I am a conscious being. Therefore my real identity is the consciousness and not this body. This Mahatma has come to this level of understanding.\n\nTherefore he is constantly devoting himself to that true self which is the consciousness. Satatam, Kirta, Yanthamam, Yatantaschadravrataha. He is constantly doing kirtan to me. He is constantly praising me. So we obviously kirtan, bhajan, kirtan. We hear these words in our day to day conversation.\n\nIn our culture, though the Bhajan is something we are thinking about the Lord. Kirtan is obviously we are praising the Lord. But here the praise and thinking about the Lord is in a very different connotation. So when I am praising the Lord, I am devoted to the Lord. Devotion is love for the Divine that we have considered divine. Our love for the Divine that becomes devotion.\n\nAnd love is nothing but identification. When I identify with something or someone, I love that thing or love that person. I love my BMW because I identify with my BMW. When I identify with the Lord as my Lord, then I devote myself to Him. This devotion is nothing but my identification with the Lord. And therefore that kirtan, kirtan is not that one Sunday afternoon or Saturday evening we get together and Swamiji says the noisy kirtan we do with equally noisy equipment.\n\nKirtan is a constant thought in my mind that I am not this limited being and my Lord is not divided in this being. But we all exist in his own being. We are only existing because he exists. I am only alive because the consciousness is functioning through me. When the consciousness will not be there, I will be purely as just a bundle of matter. They will call it dead body and get rid of it as quickly as possible.\n\nSatantiyamta, Yatantascha, Dhruvrataha. They are constantly striving because they will be pulled from this prakriti to identify with it. To identify with my body. Then go out and get things and go out and identify with things outside. I'll fall in love with things and beings outside. I have to constantly remind myself that therefore it's yatantaha.\n\nSo once you get this knowledge from the books or from a guru, you're not done with it. That's just the beginning of it. Now you have to constantly remember with everything you do. The constant efforts are required for even Mahatmas, Dhruda, vrataha. And they are steadfastly established in this knowledge. There is never a doubt that this is not true.\n\nSome of us, we read this and then we read other book and they start doubting whether this is right or that is right. The other one says there is Ishvara, the Other one says there is no Ishvara One path said there is no life after death.",
      "reflection": "The Gita promises that sincere, heartfelt offering is always received. Today, offer something simple—a leaf, a flower, a thought, a moment of gratitude—with your whole heart.\n\nDon't worry about getting it right. What matters is the quality of love behind the gesture, however imperfect. The Lord sees the heart, not the outer form.\n\nConsider: What would change if you truly believed that the supreme Reality is equally available to all, regardless of background, education, or social status? The Gita democratizes spirituality in a radical way."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter nine, Raja Vidya, Raja Guhya, Yoga, Yoga of King of Secrets and King of Knowledge. So from one through six chapters we have seen who I am and how I should work in this world, work in this world with the Spirit of Yajna. Because those accents are not binding. All others are binding. Then we have looked in chapter seven, the lower nature of the supreme, that which is manifest all around me. And then in chapter eight we have seen his higher nature which is unmanifest, supporting all the beings.\n\nThe secret still is what is my relationship with him is the secret. Having known all that, I still cannot find how I can relate to Him. So now chapter nine gives us the indication of what is your relationship with the Supreme? The Bhagavan, the Almighty, my Creator. So in the beginning he said that my relationship to this Prakriti which you are part of it. I'm trying to find out my relationship with Him.\n\nI already Learned in chapter 8 that I'm nothing but a part of this manifest world. Therefore I'm nothing but a Prakriti. See, my relationship to this manifest world, Bhagavan said, is that of a relationship less relation. So he said that this entire Jagat of moving and unmoving is pervaded by me and presided by me, Adiyakshaina. I keep eye on it, but I don't take part in it. This Jagat is in me, but I'm not in them.\n\nThey are also not in. From my perspective, from the perspective of the supreme, this Jagat does not exist and therefore it is not in me. So therefore he says, this relationship of this Prakriti and the supreme is that of no relationship but a perceived relationship. Relationship which can be associated with each other but have no real association. This entire Jagat is pervaded by me and Chara Nachar, moving and unmoving. I send them forth by my Yoga Maya.\n\nAt the beginning of the cycle I send those multitude of beings. Same multitude of beings will merge into me at the end of the cycle. And again they will start all over again. Those who do not recognize this fact because of their limited understanding of the nature of the supreme, they try to find the perfection which truly belongs to the supreme through Mogasa, Moga Karma. By the vain desires and vain actions. I'm trying to achieve something which can only be achieved at the level of perfection.\n\nI'm trying to achieve it with my little efforts here and there. Bhagavan says, therefore they cannot achieve it. But then there are others who recognize this fact that if my goal is that high, then I have to align myself with that high of an entity. The one who truly have these qualities. How do you do strategic planning? Is your capabilities with the opportunities.\n\nWhen you combine the two, that's your strategy. But I don't have capabilities. And I just keep looking at opportunities. But that's not really a strategy. My strategy in life is to get my perfect happiness. I see opportunity there.\n\nGot to be somewhere, a state where I can be happy all the time. What I miss out is, am I capable? So I am not really aligning these two. I have two different entities. One who is very limited in capability, who is trying to achieve something which is highly unachievable through incapable people. So Bhagawan said that those who recognize that they align themselves with the supreme, they focus single pointedly to align themselves, to identify themselves with that supreme who is pervading everywhere.\n\nAnd to do that, they use different methods. Different people use different methods. Once they recognize the fact that the perfect happiness is not achievable by actions. In this world of Prakriti. The world of Prakriti. The world of objects.\n\nMr. Swamiji's BMI chart. The world of Oet Objects, emotions and thoughts can never give you the perfect happiness, no matter how hard you try. They align with the supreme, the work in this world. But their goal is aligned with the Mahatmas. Those great souls who realize that perfect happiness can only be found by aligning with one who is perfect. They achieve that in many different ways.\n\nSome consider him to be only one. The one that exists and nothing else can exist. And as we have seen in our three schools of thoughts, that's Advaita Vada. I and him are no different from each other. I am under the spell of Maya. That's the only difference.\n\nSome see as Uthak is divided into many. So at least it's more than one. Creator and creation. These two, some believe, will never be able to Coincide with each other. Creation will always remain Creation. Creator will always remain Creator.\n\nFrom that perspective also people can reach Him. Or I say Bahuda Vishwathomukham. He is everywhere where I see everything. And every being I see is him alone. Every eye I see, every leg I see, every mouth I see it's all his expressions. Others see it that way that we have seen in the Visishta Dvaida.\n\nHe is whole and what I see is just the part. I have a narrow perspective on life. Therefore I cannot see him in his complete glory. But wherever I see, I see his glimpse. That's Visheshta Advaita. So Bhagavan said, any which way you can approach me, it is all coming to me only.\n\nYou see, because I am everything. If we pay, you know, money to Chinmaya mission whether in this center or any other center. But eventually it all goes to Chinmaya mission. It really doesn't matter. Any efforts you put in aligning yourself with the supreme in whatever manner whether it's Advaita, Advaita, my sister Advaita. I see him as father, mother, brother, supporter.\n\nAnd therefore they will be successful as long as they align with me in any which way. Because that's all coming to me. Because I am the father of this entire Jagat Mata Dhata Pitamaha. As we have said, I am also mother. Vidyam, Pavitram, Omkaram. That which is indicated in Veda as the supreme reality as Om which encompass all four states of existence.\n\nThree which I am very aware which is my dream world, deep sleep and waking world. In the fourth one which supports all these three, he said that's indicated by Om. Therefore whatever is indicated in the Rukh Saam and Yajuho in these books of knowledge about his nature. Any which way you approach me is acceptable. You will reach me as long as your goal is to reach me. Gatihi Bharata Prabhuhu Sakshi Nivasah Bhagawan Vidyas uses the approach sometimes.\n\nTell our young architect saying it has to be idiot proof. Consider your contractor is the greatest fool on this planet. And then do your documents. That way you will not make a mistake of him. Misunderstanding your make it so clear, so obvious that you hit the lowest denominator Bhagawan Vedvyas doesn't want to leave anything out. In case you missed it in Pitaham Masya Jagadha, Matarada Gatihi.\n\nI am the goal Bharata. I am the supporter Prabhu. I am the Lord Saksihi. Anything that is happening in this world, I am the witness. You may think that when you are doing something bad, nobody is seeing. But Bhagavan is watching that.\n\nBecause Bhagavan is every including your own self. It means you will know what you have done. Therefore I am always witness as you. I am the refuge when I am in trouble. I'm actually invoking my own capacity to overcome my difficulties. We have talked about many times.\n\nFriend is a very special relationship. Any other relationship, I have to be correct in my relationship. Then only that relationship works. I have to be correct in my behavior and correct in my approach to my relationship. Any which way we meet after a long time, they curse each other and do all the funny things hit each other. And also as a friend is one who support you.\n\nNo matter how wrong you are. Anytime I want to do something and I tell my friend Deepak, I'm trying to do this. That's not a good idea. No, but that will be fun in the end. He said, okay then if you really want to do it, let's go and do it. Just before the exams we did all the time, I'll say, deepak, let's go to see a movie.\n\nI said, but tomorrow you have an exam. I think I can make it up. And in the end he will say, okay then let's go. Friend will support even you are wrong. Even if he knows that you are going down a wrong path and going to suffer through it. Deepakon say I am that anytime you do something wrong, I know.\n\nI am telling you as your conscience. Still you want to do it. I am the beginning and the end. Sthanam also a place where you are existing support. For anything to exist, you need an inertia in space and time. A thing to exist in space and time.\n\nYou need time in inertia. Bhagavan say I am the Sthanam. That space where you exist. I'm also Treasure house. When I need knowledge O Bhagavan, O Saraswati Madha, Saraswati Puja. I want wealth of Lakshmi Mata and I am afraid Hanuman Ji or Durga Mata, whatever you want.\n\nI am the treasure house of anything you want. We have discussed this concept before. I am the source, the seed. But very different than any other source which we know. Every other source will be depleted once you exercise it. That source will be depleted.\n\nThat's why worried about this. Fossil fuel will be depleted or any seed. Once you use that seed and the tree comes out, the seed is destroyed. Immutable seed, the tree will come out or whatever the product. I still remain intact. Therefore any method which you apply is still coming to me.\n\nI am the one who bakes you as the sun. Aham Varsam, I rain down as rains. Nigruhani Utsradami I also hold and I also throw you out. I send you back Amrutham Chaya. None of us will ever have any experience of not existing. There's not a single thing or a being ever existed in this universe who has experience of not existing.\n\nWe assume we will not exist because Gandhiji is not here. My father is not here. So it's an assumed position that I will not exist. However, you can't find one person in this entire history of human race who can say, yeah, I know what it means to be not existing. Because everyone only there when they think they are existing. Amrutam Immortality, Chevamrutyustra and also death.\n\nThe death which I see decaying every day. Death and decay which I see. I as a baby has died and become a toddler. Toddler died and became a boy. And boy died, make a young man. A young man died in the old man.\n\nAnd now I think my next stage is not existing. I'm constantly seeing death. Bhagawan says that's also me. Sat, Asatya Aham Arjuna. O Arjuna in the head and Sat, that which is existing as real and also Asat that which is unreal. So Sat can be viewed in many different ways.\n\nThat which is temporary is Asat. That which is permanent is Sat. That which is cause is Sat. That we see effect is Asat. Everything in this world we see is nothing but an effect of a cause. Cause remains intact all throughout the variation and modifications of the effect Standard examples we have seen is that of the gold and gold bangles I use the space space is sat all other condition spaces, room space, cathedral space, casino space or Lasat.",

      "commentary": "In the beginning of Bhagavad Gita, the first six chapters, we have learned about ourselves as the Great Mahavakya from Upanishad Tattvamasi. That thou art that which you are seeking, that which is in control of this universe and my life. Who is that that I'm seeking is that you are that. So that paradigm shift about the one I'm seeking is not away from me, but my own self. And then we obviously have seen that the one which I consider myself me is just an equipment which I use to transact with this world. What I consider myself with this body, this mind, this intellectual.\n\nIn chapter two we have this paradigm shift that that's not you. That's actually a vehicle you use to transact with this world. But you are imperishable, immutable, unborn, never dying. That's a paradigm shift we have learned in the in the second chapter then we also learned about the Karma Yoga act. I must as an individual in this world. So I do not perpetuate this ignorance I have about myself.\n\nSo we all learned about Karma Yoga. Selfless actions will purify my mind and intellect, the internal instrument so that I'll be able to see the reality as is where myself then the universal self has no duality. It is something similar to my room space. Right now I see is completely separated from the outside. But from another developer who wants to build a big building, this space is part of the space outside. And then obviously we have seen how to get the Karma Sanyas renunciation in actions by knowledge.\n\nBy knowing that I am not the doer, I can renounce my actions. I right now take the doership and ownership of my actions. Except I am not really ready to face the consequences. And when the consequences come, I blame other people. World was unfair, society is unjust. People don't recognize my contribution.\n\nAll of that is simply because of my lack of understanding that I am not the doer. I have very little capacity to act on my Own I'm just a part of this whole fabric which is called this universe. And I'm just this minute part which only can function when other parts function in its own way. So there's a Gnana Karma Sanyas Yoga. Once the knowledge takes place that I am not by individual and island who is capable of acting that I give up my ownership of my actions and I start accepting my role as a part in this whole. And then we obviously see in meditation, Dhyana Yoga how to now reflect and contemplate on myself so I can wipe this ignorance out of myself.\n\nThose are the first six chapters we learned about ourselves. We are not with who think we are. Bhagavan said, you are part of my own self. The next three chapters which we have seen 7, 8 and 9. Obviously about that we learned about DAO first DHA means you we learned about. Then we said that who is that which I'm seeking as the Lord of this universe.\n\nTherefore Lord of my own self. Bhagavan gave his identity in the last three chapters saying I am who pervades in this entire universe in my unmanifest form, I am the source of this universe. I'll be the resting place for this universe. Everything comes out of me, everything dissolves in me. But we can recognize that. So this chapter Chapter 9 says Raja Vidya Raja Guya Yoga opened with a profound statement by Bhagavan said I manifest in this entire Jagat in my unmanifest form.\n\nBut the people fail to recognize it out of their own ignorance. The world is a mudaha. They recognize it because of their own different identifications, notions, desires, Mogasa, Moga Karmaha. They fail to recognize is something similar to Bhagavan said that you need to have a right equipment to recognize something which is unmanifest. There are radio waves in this room. I'm not sure now that they've all gone digital.\n\nBut they analog how that work? But radio waves are wireless. What are the waves which makes my wireless phone work? But to make them manifest I need an equipment. And that equipment when it is fine tuned and pointed towards that it will manifest. Those Yesterday I was listening to one of this Gujarati Katha Vyaramaj bhai Hoja.\n\nAnd I said this Samsar. We are completely surrounded by this Samsar that is constantly changing by this Maya. We are trying to find its end. Where does this Maya end? They say all over vernacular language said Sansar. You have to cross this Sansar, this ocean of Sansar.\n\nAnd for that you need A boat. And he said that boat, Ramesh bhai, is your body, this mind and this intellectual. They say it's not a ordinary. It's like a luxury liner you have. He said it is equipped fully with all that you need to cross over this in a very luxurious way. But we fail to recognize the goal of this boat and we obviously direct it towards the other things.\n\nSo we can we go in circles. Our scripture says that the ultimate goal of human life is to recognize his own self, recognize your own reality, recognize who you really are. In this evolution from a single cell amoeba to where we are now. We are fully equipped to realize who we are. But we fail to recognize that why. Trividy maam soma paha puta papa yagnehi ishtava swarganti parthayante.\n\nTe punya masa de surendra lokam asnanti divyan divideva bhoga. They say, one say, how does this work? It works as simple as wherever you put your effort, whatever your goal is that what you will achieve. What do I want to become? And we ask our little children all the time, what do you want to become when you grow up? Well, I want to be a fireman.\n\nWe never let him try to become fireman. You will never become fireman because the parents say, oh no, okay, that's a great idea. But no, no, you're not becoming fireman. We are not going to let you do that because we don't put our efforts in what we want to achieve. We achieve where we put our efforts. So you say, trayvidy maam soma paha puta papaha yagna ishtva swarganti parthayante.\n\nNow here is where not the people who are completely deluded and they don't know what they are doing. Here are the people who we consider ourselves as. Look, I really don't need to do anything. I'm a good man and doing good things. So what else do I need to do? And I constantly say doing good is not good enough.\n\nThe knowledge about yourself, what you're trying to achieve is very important before you start any action. So here it says trayvidya. Those who are expert in three vedas, those who have learned three vedas, they are knowledgeable people. They are gnaan in vedas. They are not three vedas. They are soma paha puta pah paha.\n\nOne who has drank that soma drink. Some drink was offered into the ajna and then as a prasad, you take it in a small quantity at the end of the Yajna. It indicates that the ritual is over and I'm taking whatever is came out of this Yajna. Just like when you go to temple at the end of the Aarti, Panditji is standing there and doing this Chanamrat. Basically indicate the performing of the Puja is over. And that's the conclusion of my actions.\n\nAnd I'm taking whatever will come out of the action. They are also purified of the sins. They don't have any evil qualities. They are not evil doers. They are the Veda knowers. They have done the rituals as indicated in the Vedas.\n\nThey are free from the sins. Yajnayi Ishtva Swarganti Parthayante. Having performed this sacrifice of the Yajna what their desire says they want to achieve heaven. Anything good we do what is the ultimate goal. I am doing this Puja. I am doing these actions.\n\nIn the end what we want is heaven. I can have all the good things in life and no sorrows. So Swarganti Parthayanti, the Purnya Masadya, Surendra Loka, Asnanti Divyan Divideva Bhagaana. So having earned all this merits of the good deeds they are doing the knowledge they have gathered from the Vedas. Vedas means the books of knowledge. So our Vedas are now expanded to many, many, many sciences.\n\nKnowing all this, I perform actions in a field of my chosen field and ask for Swarga. O Lord, give me a situation where there is no sorrow ever, always there is happiness. So they achieve the Surendra Loka. The Loka of the Devas. The place of Devalok. And we have talked about there are various Lokas.\n\nYou know, from Go Loka to Brahma Loka. After all they are all in my mind. When I am in a complete control and happiness, I feel I am in heaven. Things are going right. Kids are doing fine job. Nobody is bothering me.\n\nPeople are respecting me. Everybody is saying Neel, you are doing wonderful. Meena is not complaining. Surendra Loka Hatha Bhagawan says you reach that Surendra Loka. People achieve that state of Surendra Loka, Asnanti Divya Divideva Bhogan. They're enjoying all these divine pleasures which we learn in this Purana all the time.\n\nThese Apsaras are dancing. You know, somebody is doing this. Beautiful gardens, no drought anywhere. You enjoy all the Bhogas. But then I say tetam bhuktva swargalokam vishalam Enjoying these vast heavens and vast enjoyments in the heavens. Chine punya martha lo KE vishante.\n\nBut once those punyas have exhausted, no matter how infinite you think they are, Bill Gates, the most wealthiest person in this world, but you can still count his wealth, isn't it? We can put a number to it. The expert CPA sits down and look at his books and come up with this is your wealth. It can be spent very easily. It may take a longer time than my wealth, maybe infinite time, but it can be exhausted and it will be exhausted at some point of time. The Bill Gates, whoever you call it, you know descendants will not have anything.\n\nI remember one Gujarati poem I heard is Sagaadi tami sa alamna bhik magda shariya sah alam who was the Mughal emperor. He said, I've seen his descendants begging in the street. Saga di tam es salam na bhik makta serhiye. So any wealth, no matter how infinite seem right now, will be exhausted in time. But once it is same applies to you. Any amount of good deeds and good merits you have done to achieve these heavenly pleasures you will get according to your efforts, according to your ability.\n\nBut once you reach there you will enjoy those vast heavens. But at some point of time they will exhaust and will come back to you're back to the square one. You're going to start from where you have left off. Just like we have seen you go on a vacation. At the end of the vacation you are back to square one or working for another 50 weeks to earn two weeks of vacation again evam tray dharmam anuprapanna gata gatam kama kama labanthe. Thus as described in the vedas Traypapanna in those vedas as described, gata gatam kama kaaba labante they attain the state of going and coming.\n\nI perform good actions, achieve heavens, come back, keep performing good actions, go back and coming back. Obviously we say well that's good enough for me. And Bhagawan says that's why we are stuck into it, no? Because we are so addicted to this heavens, addicted to the results of my good actions that we continue to go back and forth, go back and forth into it.",
      "reflection": "The Gita promises that sincere, heartfelt offering is always received. Today, offer something simple—a leaf, a flower, a thought, a moment of gratitude—with your whole heart.\n\nDon't worry about getting it right. What matters is the quality of love behind the gesture, however imperfect. The Lord sees the heart, not the outer form.\n\nConsider: What would change if you truly believed that the supreme Reality is equally available to all, regardless of background, education, or social status? The Gita democratizes spirituality in a radical way."

      "commentary": "In the beginning of Bhagavad Gita, the first six chapters, we have learned about ourselves as the Great Mahavakya from Upanishad Tattvamasi. That thou art that which you are seeking, that which is in control of this universe and my life. Who is that that I'm seeking is that you are that. So that paradigm shift about the one I'm seeking is not away from me, but my own self. And then we obviously have seen that the one which I consider myself me is just an equipment which I use to transact with this world. What I consider myself with this body, this mind, this intellectual.\n\nIn chapter two we have this paradigm shift that that's not you. That's actually a vehicle you use to transact with this world. But you are imperishable, immutable, unborn, never dying. That's a paradigm shift we have learned in the in the second chapter then we also learned about the Karma Yoga act. I must as an individual in this world. So I do not perpetuate this ignorance I have about myself.\n\nSo we all learned about Karma Yoga. Selfless actions will purify my mind and intellect, the internal instrument so that I'll be able to see the reality as is where myself then the universal self has no duality. It is something similar to my room space. Right now I see is completely separated from the outside. But from another developer who wants to build a big building, this space is part of the space outside. And then obviously we have seen how to get the Karma Sanyas renunciation in actions by knowledge.\n\nBy knowing that I am not the doer, I can renounce my actions. I right now take the doership and ownership of my actions. Except I am not really ready to face the consequences. And when the consequences come, I blame other people. World was unfair, society is unjust. People don't recognize my contribution.\n\nAll of that is simply because of my lack of understanding that I am not the doer. I have very little capacity to act on my Own I'm just a part of this whole fabric which is called this universe. And I'm just this minute part which only can function when other parts function in its own way. So there's a Gnana Karma Sanyas Yoga. Once the knowledge takes place that I am not by individual and island who is capable of acting that I give up my ownership of my actions and I start accepting my role as a part in this whole. And then we obviously see in meditation, Dhyana Yoga how to now reflect and contemplate on myself so I can wipe this ignorance out of myself.\n\nThose are the first six chapters we learned about ourselves. We are not with who think we are. Bhagavan said, you are part of my own self. The next three chapters which we have seen 7, 8 and 9. Obviously about that we learned about DAO first DHA means you we learned about. Then we said that who is that which I'm seeking as the Lord of this universe.\n\nTherefore Lord of my own self. Bhagavan gave his identity in the last three chapters saying I am who pervades in this entire universe in my unmanifest form, I am the source of this universe. I'll be the resting place for this universe. Everything comes out of me, everything dissolves in me. But we can recognize that. So this chapter Chapter 9 says Raja Vidya Raja Guya Yoga opened with a profound statement by Bhagavan said I manifest in this entire Jagat in my unmanifest form.\n\nBut the people fail to recognize it out of their own ignorance. The world is a mudaha. They recognize it because of their own different identifications, notions, desires, Mogasa, Moga Karmaha. They fail to recognize is something similar to Bhagavan said that you need to have a right equipment to recognize something which is unmanifest. There are radio waves in this room. I'm not sure now that they've all gone digital.\n\nBut they analog how that work? But radio waves are wireless. What are the waves which makes my wireless phone work? But to make them manifest I need an equipment. And that equipment when it is fine tuned and pointed towards that it will manifest. Those Yesterday I was listening to one of this Gujarati Katha Vyaramaj bhai Hoja.\n\nAnd I said this Samsar. We are completely surrounded by this Samsar that is constantly changing by this Maya. We are trying to find its end. Where does this Maya end? They say all over vernacular language said Sansar. You have to cross this Sansar, this ocean of Sansar.\n\nAnd for that you need A boat. And he said that boat, Ramesh bhai, is your body, this mind and this intellectual. They say it's not a ordinary. It's like a luxury liner you have. He said it is equipped fully with all that you need to cross over this in a very luxurious way. But we fail to recognize the goal of this boat and we obviously direct it towards the other things.\n\nSo we can we go in circles. Our scripture says that the ultimate goal of human life is to recognize his own self, recognize your own reality, recognize who you really are. In this evolution from a single cell amoeba to where we are now. We are fully equipped to realize who we are. But we fail to recognize that why. Trividy maam soma paha puta papa yagnehi ishtava swarganti parthayante.\n\nTe punya masa de surendra lokam asnanti divyan divideva bhoga. They say, one say, how does this work? It works as simple as wherever you put your effort, whatever your goal is that what you will achieve. What do I want to become? And we ask our little children all the time, what do you want to become when you grow up? Well, I want to be a fireman.\n\nWe never let him try to become fireman. You will never become fireman because the parents say, oh no, okay, that's a great idea. But no, no, you're not becoming fireman. We are not going to let you do that because we don't put our efforts in what we want to achieve. We achieve where we put our efforts. So you say, trayvidy maam soma paha puta papaha yagna ishtva swarganti parthayante.\n\nNow here is where not the people who are completely deluded and they don't know what they are doing. Here are the people who we consider ourselves as. Look, I really don't need to do anything. I'm a good man and doing good things. So what else do I need to do? And I constantly say doing good is not good enough.\n\nThe knowledge about yourself, what you're trying to achieve is very important before you start any action. So here it says trayvidya. Those who are expert in three vedas, those who have learned three vedas, they are knowledgeable people. They are gnaan in vedas. They are not three vedas. They are soma paha puta pah paha.\n\nOne who has drank that soma drink. Some drink was offered into the ajna and then as a prasad, you take it in a small quantity at the end of the Yajna. It indicates that the ritual is over and I'm taking whatever is came out of this Yajna. Just like when you go to temple at the end of the Aarti, Panditji is standing there and doing this Chanamrat. Basically indicate the performing of the Puja is over. And that's the conclusion of my actions.\n\nAnd I'm taking whatever will come out of the action. They are also purified of the sins. They don't have any evil qualities. They are not evil doers. They are the Veda knowers. They have done the rituals as indicated in the Vedas.\n\nThey are free from the sins. Yajnayi Ishtva Swarganti Parthayante. Having performed this sacrifice of the Yajna what their desire says they want to achieve heaven. Anything good we do what is the ultimate goal. I am doing this Puja. I am doing these actions.\n\nIn the end what we want is heaven. I can have all the good things in life and no sorrows. So Swarganti Parthayanti, the Purnya Masadya, Surendra Loka, Asnanti Divyan Divideva Bhagaana. So having earned all this merits of the good deeds they are doing the knowledge they have gathered from the Vedas. Vedas means the books of knowledge. So our Vedas are now expanded to many, many, many sciences.\n\nKnowing all this, I perform actions in a field of my chosen field and ask for Swarga. O Lord, give me a situation where there is no sorrow ever, always there is happiness. So they achieve the Surendra Loka. The Loka of the Devas. The place of Devalok. And we have talked about there are various Lokas.\n\nYou know, from Go Loka to Brahma Loka. After all they are all in my mind. When I am in a complete control and happiness, I feel I am in heaven. Things are going right. Kids are doing fine job. Nobody is bothering me.\n\nPeople are respecting me. Everybody is saying Neel, you are doing wonderful. Meena is not complaining. Surendra Loka Hatha Bhagawan says you reach that Surendra Loka. People achieve that state of Surendra Loka, Asnanti Divya Divideva Bhogan. They're enjoying all these divine pleasures which we learn in this Purana all the time.\n\nThese Apsaras are dancing. You know, somebody is doing this. Beautiful gardens, no drought anywhere. You enjoy all the Bhogas. But then I say tetam bhuktva swargalokam vishalam Enjoying these vast heavens and vast enjoyments in the heavens. Chine punya martha lo KE vishante.\n\nBut once those punyas have exhausted, no matter how infinite you think they are, Bill Gates, the most wealthiest person in this world, but you can still count his wealth, isn't it?

It may take a longer time than my wealth, maybe infinite time, but it can be exhausted and it will be exhausted at some point of time.

He said, I've seen his descendants begging in the street. Saga di tam es salam na bhik makta serhiye. So any wealth, no matter how infinite seem right now, will be exhausted in time. But once it is same applies to you. Any amount of good deeds and good merits you have done to achieve these heavenly pleasures you will get according to your efforts, according to your ability.\n\nBut once you reach there you will enjoy those vast heavens. But at some point of time they will exhaust and will come back to you're back to the square one. You're going to start from where you have left off. Just like we have seen you go on a vacation. At the end of the vacation you are back to square one or working for another 50 weeks to earn two weeks of vacation again evam tray dharmam anuprapanna gata gatam kama kama labanthe. Thus as described in the vedas Traypapanna in those vedas as described, gata gatam kama kaaba labante they attain the state of going and coming.\n\nI perform good actions, achieve heavens, come back, keep performing good actions, go back and coming back. Obviously we say well that's good enough for me. And Bhagawan says that's why we are stuck into it, no?

      "commentary": "Obviously we have seen, as Bhagavan said, a royal secret, a grand secret is something which is very close to us but we fail to recognize. Therefore it's a secret. So the first declaration in this chapter, Bhagawan says that even though I pervade this entire Jagat, the universe, this creation, in my unmanifest form, all the beings dwell in me, but I don't dwell in them. They are in me, but I'm not in them. Which is obviously quite contrary to what we typically have learned all our life through all religions saying, Bhagwan, the Lord is within you. Here he said, even though I pervade the entire universe in my unmanifest form, I do not dwell in them, they dwell in Me.\n\nThen he even further clarifies in saying, but in reality, they are also not in me. In other words, if we can take it on its face value, if we say we are in him, obviously we are influencing his being. All my qualities of limitedness and imperfection will affect Him. And therefore he says, in reality, even they are not in Me. None of the qualities we see in this world, in the things and beings, Bhagavan Siddi does not exist in me. All the imperfections we see in this world, which we constantly wonder why Lord created this world like that.\n\nAnd he says, it is not in Me. And then obviously we have continued to discuss this, the relationship of this creation and the Lord self. And he says, even though this world is created by my Maya, I am the efficient cause for this world and I am also the material cause for this world. And therefore everything comes out of me and everything goes back to me. Because there is no nothing other than him existed before this creation was created. Then nothing will exist after this creation will be dissolved.\n\nAll that was there was his own self. So Bhagavan said, the relationship, less relationship between the Prakriti, the world, the manifest world as we know, and the unmanifest self which he says pervades entire Jagat, is that of a non existent relationship. But we have created this relationship. So then we have understood that everything which we do is because of the Lord's presence. As long as I'm conscious, I can act in this world. So Bhagavan said that everything you do eventually comes to me.\n\nI'm the only enjoyer. Consciousness is the only enjoyer in any being. Because only time we enjoy or suffer is when we are conscious about it. So we have seen that relationship. The Bhagavan says, everything comes out of me. Everything dissolves in me.\n\nEverything is possible because of me. Everything can be done only with my presence. However, because of our desires and wrong identification with this limited self we create our own world of actions and world of our worship. And you see, depending on my desires, I worship the Lord of my heart. I put my efforts into the field where I want success. So Bhagawan says, those who apply their efforts for their desires to fulfill they will be blessed to get their desires fulfilled by me.\n\nSo then we have seen in detail that the worshipers of the Devas goes to the Devas. Worshipper of the Bhutas goes to Bhutas. Worshipper of the Pitrus go to the Pitras. Deva, as we say Diva is to illumine which relates to our senses. So whoever perceives the visual arts, excel in visual arts. Whoever perceives performing arts, excels in performing arts.\n\nSo we know in this world we can prove from our own experience that wherever I put my efforts, wherever I identify myself, that's the field I'll excel. That the success I will receive. Same way we see the Pitruloka, the cultural heritage of our ancestors. Those who value that and put efforts in that, they will achieve that. Bhutas we have seen is the physical sciences. Science of this manifest world is Bhuta.\n\nThose who pursue that, they excel in that. But see, all these successes are finite in nature, exist in time and space. And once you achieve that success, enjoy the fruits of it. You to come back to pursue the next desire which you have and the next success you want. So this is the coming and going which Bhagavad Gita and Upanishad describe. We constantly achieve, things, enjoy it, come back, strive for something else, achieve that, come back, strive for something else.\n\nProfessor Bhagawan said, the one who worships me. And we have seen, worship is devotion. Devotion is the love for the Divine. Love is identification. One who starts identifying with that eternal self will achieve me. And that we have seen in the last three verses.\n\nVerse 26 actually says Patram Puspam falam toyam Yomi bhakta prayachati Tadaham bhakt Apurhat asnami prayatat Manaha. Whatsoever my devotee offer me with devotion, I accept that. That's good enough for me. You really don't have to have elaborate resources to worship Lord. And as we discussed last time, it takes away any excuse that I may have. Look, I'm not strong enough.\n\nI don't have enough strength or I don't have enough wealth. But once it is whatever you can offer from my own garden, whatever you can pluck and give it back to me, I'll be happy simply because I see your devotion. What he's looking for is your intention, your devotion and your attitude. So the next verse 27 says, Yat karosi yatasnasi yat johosi dadasiyat. Now here comes the prescription. We have seen in theory what is our relationship to the Lord?\n\nWhat can we do to remove this parallax between myself and his self? And then we may have an excuse saying, but I'm not capable of doing so. There is a very simple method. And you will not need anything more than what you already have. All you have to do is change your attitude in what you do. So you say, Yat karosi, whatever you do, no matter who you are, you're a cobbler, a weaver, a doctor, an engineer, a president.\n\nWhatever you are, whatever you are doing, yat asnasi, whatever you are receiving, eating. Basically Swamiji always expand the view and say, eating is not only what we eat through our mouth. Anything which we eat through our eyes and ears and all the senses. Asnasi, yat chihosi, whatever you offer back to the world, Yat dadasi, whatever you give as charity, what you consider as your charity, Yat tapasyasi, whatever the discipline you are following. We all follow some discipline. I have to get up in the morning, do this, do that.\n\nSo we have discipline to achieve anything. We follow discipline. See, whatever discipline you are following to achieve what we are chewing, it is that simple. Do not do it for yourself. Right now we are doing it for ourselves. It very clear in my mind why I am doing this.\n\nNeil, why are you doing this? Well, because I want to do this. Neil, why don't you do this? Because I don't want to do that. It's as simple as that. So we know very clearly that all my actions are for me.\n\nFor me to achieve what I want. Bhagavan says, just change that attitude and have that attitude that I'm offering. All my actions, all my charities, all my disciplines, all that I'm receiving is to him. Because without his presence as the consciousness in me, none of these activities are possible in the first place. So who am I to take credit now when I say who am I? As I said I reside in my ego.\n\nThat I which is residing in my ego. If it gives up that I and said I'm only possible as long as this consciousness functions through me. And I do not know where this consciousness come from, it must be my Lord's presence and I offer all my actions to him. Bhagavan says, you will achieve myself. So that's a simple prescription. Do not change anything that you are doing except change your attitude that you're not doing it for yourself, you're doing it for him.\n\nTherefore he when you enjoy something, he's the enjoyer. When you suffer, he's the sufferer. You achieve something, he's the achiever. When you fail somewhere, he is the failure. So Subha, Subha fala evam moks Thus you shall be freed from this bondage of Stuba and Ashuba. This is not good for me.\n\nWhen something good for me happens, I'm very proud. Something doesn't good happen for me. I blame everybody else other than me. He should have done this. Why didn't he tell me that? Why didn't he do that?\n\nWe find everybody responsible except me. Also it creates negative impression on my mind. Well, next time I never want to do that. I went to this organization for volunteer my services and they were not appreciative at all. I will never do that again. So I lost a chance of doing something good in life.\n\nThat bondage which is created by the impressions on my mind, by perceiving this is good for me and this is bad for me. You will be freed from. You will then see clearly without having a cataract in your vision. I went to the doctor few weeks ago and he said you are open right eye. You can barely see anything, completely fuzzy. Well, I said I'm fine.\n\nHe said, that's because your left eye is taking over. And he said, thank God you don't have cataract in both eyes. That's exactly what he told me. So you can imagine if you have a cataract in a vision in both your eyes, the world will be very fuzzy. And Bhagavan said, that's where we are Right now. Because if one eye we see Subha, other we see a Subha and we have a very distorted view of this world.\n\nBut once we are freed from that, you have 2020 vision of this world. And then you will be doing exactly what is appropriate at an appropriate time. And when you do that, you know what you will achieve? So you'll be freed from by changing your attitude about everything you do. From doing it for myself to doing it for his self, I will be freed from the bondage of this is good and this is bad. Whatever the results come from my actions, I'll say, lord, you gave me this Buddhi to do this and I did that.\n\nNow this is what you are giving me as a prasad. I'm sure you know what you're doing. Then this must be good for me. I'm accepting it and I'm moving forward. Next step, Sannyasa, Yoga Yuktatma, Vimukto Mam Upeshasi. You will become Sannyasa and Yoga Yuktatma.\n\nWe have learned these terms in previous chapters that should I be a Sanyasi or should I be any yogi? He says sannyasi is the one who has given up the sense of agency. I am the doer that agency. One who gives up, he is called Sannyasi. Swamiji says, not the one who wears the saffron robe and have a long beard. One who has given up the sense of agency that I am the doer is a Sannyasi.\n\nThe yogi is the one who has given up the desire for the results of the actions. One who is given the Karma Phala is the yogi. You are established in Yoga if you have no particular desire for particular results. I will do my actions because I am not the Karma Faladatta. I am never the actor is never in control of its results. It's always somebody else.\n\nYou present a song, you present a performance. It's not who you are going to applaud.

      "commentary": "Obviously we have seen, as Bhagavan said, a royal secret, a grand secret is something which is very close to us but we fail to recognize. Therefore it's a secret. So the first declaration in this chapter, Bhagawan says that even though I pervade this entire Jagat, the universe, this creation, in my unmanifest form, all the beings dwell in me, but I don't dwell in them. They are in me, but I'm not in them. Which is obviously quite contrary to what we typically have learned all our life through all religions saying, Bhagwan, the Lord is within you. Here he said, even though I pervade the entire universe in my unmanifest form, I do not dwell in them, they dwell in Me.\n\nThen he even further clarifies in saying, but in reality, they are also not in me. In other words, if we can take it on its face value, if we say we are in him, obviously we are influencing his being. All my qualities of limitedness and imperfection will affect Him. And therefore he says, in reality, even they are not in Me. None of the qualities we see in this world, in the things and beings, Bhagavan Siddi does not exist in me. All the imperfections we see in this world, which we constantly wonder why Lord created this world like that.\n\nAnd he says, it is not in Me. And then obviously we have continued to discuss this, the relationship of this creation and the Lord self. And he says, even though this world is created by my Maya, I am the efficient cause for this world and I am also the material cause for this world. And therefore everything comes out of me and everything goes back to me. Because there is no nothing other than him existed before this creation was created. Then nothing will exist after this creation will be dissolved.\n\nAll that was there was his own self. So Bhagavan said, the relationship, less relationship between the Prakriti, the world, the manifest world as we know, and the unmanifest self which he says pervades entire Jagat, is that of a non existent relationship. But we have created this relationship. So then we have understood that everything which we do is because of the Lord's presence. As long as I'm conscious, I can act in this world. So Bhagavan said that everything you do eventually comes to me.\n\nI'm the only enjoyer. Consciousness is the only enjoyer in any being. Because only time we enjoy or suffer is when we are conscious about it. So we have seen that relationship. The Bhagavan says, everything comes out of me. Everything dissolves in me.\n\nEverything is possible because of me. Everything can be done only with my presence. However, because of our desires and wrong identification with this limited self we create our own world of actions and world of our worship. And you see, depending on my desires, I worship the Lord of my heart. I put my efforts into the field where I want success. So Bhagawan says, those who apply their efforts for their desires to fulfill they will be blessed to get their desires fulfilled by me.\n\nSo then we have seen in detail that the worshipers of the Devas goes to the Devas. Worshipper of the Bhutas goes to Bhutas. Worshipper of the Pitrus go to the Pitras. Deva, as we say Diva is to illumine which relates to our senses. So whoever perceives the visual arts, excel in visual arts. Whoever perceives performing arts, excels in performing arts.\n\nSo we know in this world we can prove from our own experience that wherever I put my efforts, wherever I identify myself, that's the field I'll excel. That the success I will receive. Same way we see the Pitruloka, the cultural heritage of our ancestors. Those who value that and put efforts in that, they will achieve that. Bhutas we have seen is the physical sciences. Science of this manifest world is Bhuta.\n\nThose who pursue that, they excel in that. But see, all these successes are finite in nature, exist in time and space. And once you achieve that success, enjoy the fruits of it. You to come back to pursue the next desire which you have and the next success you want. So this is the coming and going which Bhagavad Gita and Upanishad describe. We constantly achieve, things, enjoy it, come back, strive for something else, achieve that, come back, strive for something else.\n\nProfessor Bhagawan said, the one who worships me. And we have seen, worship is devotion. Devotion is the love for the Divine. Love is identification. One who starts identifying with that eternal self will achieve me. And that we have seen in the last three verses.\n\nVerse 26 actually says Patram Puspam falam toyam Yomi bhakta prayachati Tadaham bhakt Apurhat asnami prayatat Manaha. Whatsoever my devotee offer me with devotion, I accept that. That's good enough for me. You really don't have to have elaborate resources to worship Lord. And as we discussed last time, it takes away any excuse that I may have. Look, I'm not strong enough.\n\nI don't have enough strength or I don't have enough wealth. But once it is whatever you can offer from my own garden, whatever you can pluck and give it back to me, I'll be happy simply because I see your devotion. What he's looking for is your intention, your devotion and your attitude. So the next verse 27 says, Yat karosi yatasnasi yat johosi dadasiyat. Now here comes the prescription. We have seen in theory what is our relationship to the Lord?\n\nWhat can we do to remove this parallax between myself and his self? And then we may have an excuse saying, but I'm not capable of doing so. There is a very simple method. And you will not need anything more than what you already have. All you have to do is change your attitude in what you do. So you say, Yat karosi, whatever you do, no matter who you are, you're a cobbler, a weaver, a doctor, an engineer, a president.\n\nWhatever you are, whatever you are doing, yat asnasi, whatever you are receiving, eating. Basically Swamiji always expand the view and say, eating is not only what we eat through our mouth. Anything which we eat through our eyes and ears and all the senses. Asnasi, yat chihosi, whatever you offer back to the world, Yat dadasi, whatever you give as charity, what you consider as your charity, Yat tapasyasi, whatever the discipline you are following. We all follow some discipline. I have to get up in the morning, do this, do that.\n\nSo we have discipline to achieve anything. We follow discipline. See, whatever discipline you are following to achieve what we are chewing, it is that simple. Do not do it for yourself. Right now we are doing it for ourselves. It very clear in my mind why I am doing this.\n\nNeil, why are you doing this? Well, because I want to do this. Neil, why don't you do this? Because I don't want to do that. It's as simple as that. So we know very clearly that all my actions are for me.\n\nFor me to achieve what I want. Bhagavan says, just change that attitude and have that attitude that I'm offering. All my actions, all my charities, all my disciplines, all that I'm receiving is to him. Because without his presence as the consciousness in me, none of these activities are possible in the first place. So who am I to take credit now when I say who am I? As I said I reside in my ego.\n\nThat I which is residing in my ego. If it gives up that I and said I'm only possible as long as this consciousness functions through me. And I do not know where this consciousness come from, it must be my Lord's presence and I offer all my actions to him. Bhagavan says, you will achieve myself. So that's a simple prescription. Do not change anything that you are doing except change your attitude that you're not doing it for yourself, you're doing it for him.\n\nTherefore he when you enjoy something, he's the enjoyer. When you suffer, he's the sufferer. You achieve something, he's the achiever. When you fail somewhere, he is the failure. So Subha, Subha fala evam moks Thus you shall be freed from this bondage of Stuba and Ashuba. This is not good for me.\n\nWhen something good for me happens, I'm very proud. Something doesn't good happen for me. I blame everybody else other than me. He should have done this. Why didn't he tell me that? Why didn't he do that?\n\nWe find everybody responsible except me. Also it creates negative impression on my mind. Well, next time I never want to do that. I went to this organization for volunteer my services and they were not appreciative at all. I will never do that again. So I lost a chance of doing something good in life.\n\nThat bondage which is created by the impressions on my mind, by perceiving this is good for me and this is bad for me. You will be freed from. You will then see clearly without having a cataract in your vision. I went to the doctor few weeks ago and he said you are open right eye. You can barely see anything, completely fuzzy. Well, I said I'm fine.\n\nHe said, that's because your left eye is taking over. And he said, thank God you don't have cataract in both eyes. That's exactly what he told me. So you can imagine if you have a cataract in a vision in both your eyes, the world will be very fuzzy. And Bhagavan said, that's where we are Right now. Because if one eye we see Subha, other we see a Subha and we have a very distorted view of this world.\n\nBut once we are freed from that, you have 2020 vision of this world. And then you will be doing exactly what is appropriate at an appropriate time. And when you do that, you know what you will achieve? So you'll be freed from by changing your attitude about everything you do. From doing it for myself to doing it for his self, I will be freed from the bondage of this is good and this is bad. Whatever the results come from my actions, I'll say, lord, you gave me this Buddhi to do this and I did that.\n\nNow this is what you are giving me as a prasad. I'm sure you know what you're doing. Then this must be good for me. I'm accepting it and I'm moving forward. Next step, Sannyasa, Yoga Yuktatma, Vimukto Mam Upeshasi. You will become Sannyasa and Yoga Yuktatma.\n\nWe have learned these terms in previous chapters that should I be a Sanyasi or should I be any yogi? He says sannyasi is the one who has given up the sense of agency. I am the doer that agency. One who gives up, he is called Sannyasi. Swamiji says, not the one who wears the saffron robe and have a long beard. One who has given up the sense of agency that I am the doer is a Sannyasi.\n\nThe yogi is the one who has given up the desire for the results of the actions. One who is given the Karma Phala is the yogi. You are established in Yoga if you have no particular desire for particular results. I will do my actions because I am not the Karma Faladatta. I am never the actor is never in control of its results. It's always somebody else.\n\nYou present a song, you present a performance. It's not who you are going to applaud. Other people are going to applaud or other people are going to throw stones at you.",
      "reflection": "The Gita promises that sincere, heartfelt offering is always received. Today, offer something simple—a leaf, a flower, a thought, a moment of gratitude—with your whole heart.\n\nDon't worry about getting it right. What matters is the quality of love behind the gesture, however imperfect. The Lord sees the heart, not the outer form.\n\nConsider: What would change if you truly believed that the supreme Reality is equally available to all, regardless of background, education, or social status? The Gita democratizes spirituality in a radical way."

      "commentary": "So we are concluding chapter nine today. Chapter nine, Raja Vidya, Raja Guja Yoga. Yoga of Royal Knowledge and Royal Secret. And obviously the question last time, what is this secret? Well, we have discussed many times, the secret is, where does my happiness lie? All my life I was seeking one thing and one thing alone.\n\nThat is permanent happiness and permanent peace. I have tried everywhere, I have tried in getting knowledge, learning things in this world. I have tried in accomplishing things, achieving things, acquiring things in my relationships. But in the end, if every happiness came with associated unhappiness, as we have learned through our life that anything which has a capacity to give me happiness has equal amount of capacity to give me unhappiness. In our relationships we know exactly closer you are, more chances of getting hurt. Even though we know what we are looking for and looking everywhere in our life, we can't find our happiness.\n\nSo that's the secret. And whatever makes me find that will be the knowledge which will be royal knowledge. So Brahmagnan is the secret. Unless you have the Brahmagnaan, you will never find this permanent happiness. And Brahma Vidya is the Raja Vidya. And Swamiji explains that why it is called Rajavidya.\n\nRaja Vidya is something which is available to all. The road which is available to everybody, Rajmarg, anybody can pass through that road, not restricted. It is the Raja Vidya because it is available to all. So the Brahma Vidya is the Rajavidya because this knowledge is available to all. Brahma Ghana is the royal sacred. Because everyone has a birthright to know that knowledge.\n\nAnd still none of us is capable of finding it easily. So Bhagavan said that that is the knowledge, that is the secret. I'm going to tell you which is Pavitram Ida Muthamam. It is the highest purifier. Once you wake up from your dream, the waking state is the highest purifier of your dream state. All your problems of the dream state go away.\n\nSo we have started learning that Brahmagna is the one secret I need to Unlocked. And the key is the Brahma Vidya. And therefore rest of the chapter is spent in describing what Brahman is, what is the nature of Brahman and what my relationship is with Him. So we have elaborately seen that there is nothing in this world which is other than Brahman. In his manifest form he becomes this Prakriti, this manifestation. Anything which I see is nothing but the manifestation of the same reality.\n\nFrom science point of view, we have discussed the singularity at one time because of the Big Bang. It is now a plurality and someday it will recede back into singularity again. So the same entity which is pervading everywhere is the basis of this reality as we know. And then what is my relationship? You see it's a relationship less relation that all the qualities of Brahman are in me because I am his manifestation. I am nothing but that this world is created by the Creator out of his own self.\n\nBecause there is no other material was available to Him. Only available material to create this world was his own self. Because if you think that there is other material available then he obviously is not complete God. So we have to come to the conclusion that his self and this universe and myself is one and the same. But I just can't recognize it. That is the Avidy which we have to dispel.\n\nSo this knowledge will dispel that Avidya Bhagavan said and therefore it is Rajavidy. So we have learned the nature of the Brahman that everything is because of Brahman. Everything resides in Brahman but Brahman does not reside in it. In other words, my limitations are not in Brahman. My ignorance is not part of Brahman. The Creator with his power of Maya he creates this universe through the Mayapati.\n\nHe is the Lord of Maya, Lord of this illusion. But I am under spell of Maya and therefore I'm in a Maya Jal. I'm in the web of Maya. I can't see it clearly what my self is. He said the Vidya which will takes me there would be the Raja Vidya, that which dispels my ignorance about my own self. When I start seeing my relationship clearly with him then I will be Dharmaatma.\n\nI'll be a righteous soul. So Bhagavan has talked about the why people can't see it because of the Moga Asa Mogha actions. I'll find my happiness here, I'll find my happiness there. And that's where we are confused. But the Mahatma, they single pointedly seek that happiness at the source of happiness which is the Brahman which is the Almighty Lord which is my own self. So what is my relationship with Him?\n\nHe is as close to me as my own self. But there is no special relationship he is with me. Because I am a Dharmatma and others are not good people. He says I am same to Samoham Sarva Bhulteshu. My relationship to them is same as my relationship to you, him, her, my relationship to my children. If they have my four children, that's exactly same.\n\nBut one is closer to me than other. Because he identifies with me more, he writes to me more, he calls me up more, he comes to see me more, I have more relationship with Him. One who never calls me, never writes me, never come to Thanksgiving dinner. I have less relationship with Him. But my relationship with him is exactly same. Tamoham Sarva Bhuteshuk Everything and every being is made up of me alone.\n\nTherefore relationship is exactly same. Just as my relationship with my left leg and right leg exactly same. Even though I rely on my left leg more because right leg is broken. So Bhagavan says Samoham Sarva Bhuteshru and each one is the birthright to know this. But because we are deluded, therefore I don't recognize it. Just because I think that I have not done something right in my past that does not stop me from realizing this truth.\n\nDurachara Su is a prefix to Durachar supreme In Durachar Sudhura, one who is the highest sinner. You want to say he has right to realize me. Bhajataimam Ananya Bhag. Once he is single, pointedly identifies with him. Sadhu evasamantavya Samyak Vyavasthitohi Saha. Once he is rightfully resolved, once he has completely realized what is the right way of living, what is his swadharma, then he says he should be considered Sadhu.\n\nSwamiji says this is Krishna's missionary zeal to expand the tent to its infinity. Everybody is in it, nobody left out. So once that person is rightly resolved, we must consider him as a good person. Forget about what his past is all about. And the next verse says why that is because Kshhipram Bhavati Dharmatma. Once you have a right resolve, you very soon will become what you resolved to become.\n\nSee, it's all about your conviction about what is right and what is wrong. What is the right action? What is the wrong action? What is the right way of living and what is the wrong way of living. This is the right way to live. You will become that in no time.\n\nBhagawan saswat shantim ni gachati. And you will achieve that in eternal peace. Peace which I had been seeking all my life and I have blamed everybody other than me. Children are not behaving to my expectations. Once you resolve rightfully where your Santi is, you will in no time achieve it. Satsvatsanti m ni gachadhi.\n\nSuch a person will achieve that eternal peace in no time. Kaunteya pratijane hi Namay Bhaktah pranashyati. It is obviously a little pat on Arjuna's back. Because Pandava, no time during their life they ever questioned their relationship with Krishna or their faith in Krishna. So in our case also, if I have complete faith in that Supreme Lord who is myself, then my peace lies there. Then Bhagavan says Namibhta Pranashati, one who identifies with me will never be destroyed.\n\nNever be destroyed in a sense that he will never lose his peace again. Once I have decided where my peace is and rightfully pursuing that single pointedly, Bhagavan said he will never go back to getting unhappy again. The next verse obviously has been difficult for people to translate and understand. Mamhi partha viapa e apishuhu Papayonayaha. Then he described Triyo vaishya Tathakshudra Tiyapi yanti paramgati. They also achieve my being.\n\nThey are the people who are born in Papiyoni. Correct Understanding can only be gained if we can define Papiyogyni correctly. That's where the problem is, right? Because he actually enumerated given examples of class of people who are born in Papiyogi. It is very loosely translated as sinful birth. Well then you have to define sin.\n\nSin we have defined as a negative impression on my mind which is damaging to my chances of getting peace. When my mind is agitated, no matter how gnani I am, I will not have peace. So we know that that the mind when it is agitated with any negative impression, there is no peace. Papa is the one which loots away my peace. So Papa yoni is the environment which has the most chances of giving me the negative impression on my mind is the Papiyony. Environment is not something which I control.\n\nSo if I am put up in that environment, it is not my fault. It is not something I have chosen I happen to be in that environment. So in modern day we call it disadvantaged class of people minority In India, Jains have fought very hard to be classified as minority. And they finally get the same status as Muslims and Christians who are considered minority in India. It is not something they are saying well we are bad, just consider us. No, they say we are disadvantaged because we are not majority.\n\nSo Papiyoni is something which creates an environment which has more chances of putting negative impression on my mind. So Bhagavan said that people who have not that privilege of being in the pious and the best environment and those people are Triya, Vaishya Da Takshudra in which society, in which time of the history you think that the women have the same rights as men including 2016. We know they're always disadvantaged. So it is not their fault. It is the society's fault if the society the way it is designed is not giving them equal opportunity. There is a movie coming up the Birth of a Nation.\n\nIt's about how and I have not seen anything. I just saw a clip on one of those talk show. They said that in the slavery days a black child and white child will be playing together till the age of about 11. About 11 they will decide that only now the black child has reached highest of his or her development. So he doesn't need to be sent to school or do anything about it. He can now start working.\n\nWhite child will continue in his development of learning and going to school. So now is that something you consider a pap. Yoni because the child is born in that yoni or the society is not giving him an opportunity. Bhagavan said the society which has not given them the opportunity they deserve opportunity rightfully theirs which is their birthright we are not giving them. You see, even though you are born in that class of people who are disadvantaged, you have equal right to achieve the highest potential that you have in those days. And even today, today there are classes which are disadvantaged.\n\nTriya Vaishya, Tatak Shudra women by history, everybody can vouch for it that they never had the equal rights.",

He says I am same to Samoham Sarva Bhulteshu. My relationship to them is same as my relationship to you, him, her, my relationship to my children. If they have my four children, that's exactly same.\n\nBut one is closer to me than other. Because he identifies with me more, he writes to me more, he calls me up more, he comes to see me more, I have more relationship with Him. One who never calls me, never writes me, never come to Thanksgiving dinner. I have less relationship with Him. But my relationship with him is exactly same. Tamoham Sarva Bhuteshuk Everything and every being is made up of me alone.\n\nTherefore relationship is exactly same. Just as my relationship with my left leg and right leg exactly same. Even though I rely on my left leg more because right leg is broken. So Bhagavan says Samoham Sarva Bhuteshru and each one is the birthright to know this. But because we are deluded, therefore I don't recognize it. Just because I think that I have not done something right in my past that does not stop me from realizing this truth.\n\nDurachara Su is a prefix to Durachar supreme In Durachar Sudhura, one who is the highest sinner. You want to say he has right to realize me. Bhajataimam Ananya Bhag. Once he is single, pointedly identifies with him. Sadhu evasamantavya Samyak Vyavasthitohi Saha. Once he is rightfully resolved, once he has completely realized what is the right way of living, what is his swadharma, then he says he should be considered Sadhu.\n\nSwamiji says this is Krishna's missionary zeal to expand the tent to its infinity. Everybody is in it, nobody left out. So once that person is rightly resolved, we must consider him as a good person. Forget about what his past is all about. And the next verse says why that is because Kshhipram Bhavati Dharmatma. Once you have a right resolve, you very soon will become what you resolved to become.\n\nSee, it's all about your conviction about what is right and what is wrong. What is the right action? What is the wrong action? What is the right way of living and what is the wrong way of living. This is the right way to live. You will become that in no time.\n\nBhagawan saswat shantim ni gachati. And you will achieve that in eternal peace. Peace which I had been seeking all my life and I have blamed everybody other than me. Children are not behaving to my expectations. Once you resolve rightfully where your Santi is, you will in no time achieve it. Satsvatsanti m ni gachadhi.\n\nSuch a person will achieve that eternal peace in no time. Kaunteya pratijane hi Namay Bhaktah pranashyati. It is obviously a little pat on Arjuna's back. Because Pandava, no time during their life they ever questioned their relationship with Krishna or their faith in Krishna. So in our case also, if I have complete faith in that Supreme Lord who is myself, then my peace lies there. Then Bhagavan says Namibhta Pranashati, one who identifies with me will never be destroyed.\n\nNever be destroyed in a sense that he will never lose his peace again. Once I have decided where my peace is and rightfully pursuing that single pointedly, Bhagavan said he will never go back to getting unhappy again. The next verse obviously has been difficult for people to translate and understand. Mamhi partha viapa e apishuhu Papayonayaha. Then he described Triyo vaishya Tathakshudra Tiyapi yanti paramgati. They also achieve my being.\n\nThey are the people who are born in Papiyoni. Correct Understanding can only be gained if we can define Papiyogyni correctly. That's where the problem is, right? Because he actually enumerated given examples of class of people who are born in Papiyogi. It is very loosely translated as sinful birth. Well then you have to define sin.\n\nSin we have defined as a negative impression on my mind which is damaging to my chances of getting peace. When my mind is agitated, no matter how gnani I am, I will not have peace. So we know that that the mind when it is agitated with any negative impression, there is no peace. Papa is the one which loots away my peace. So Papa yoni is the environment which has the most chances of giving me the negative impression on my mind is the Papiyony. Environment is not something which I control.\n\nSo if I am put up in that environment, it is not my fault. It is not something I have chosen I happen to be in that environment. So in modern day we call it disadvantaged class of people minority In India, Jains have fought very hard to be classified as minority. And they finally get the same status as Muslims and Christians who are considered minority in India. It is not something they are saying well we are bad, just consider us. No, they say we are disadvantaged because we are not majority.\n\nSo Papiyoni is something which creates an environment which has more chances of putting negative impression on my mind. So Bhagavan said that people who have not that privilege of being in the pious and the best environment and those people are Triya, Vaishya Da Takshudra in which society, in which time of the history you think that the women have the same rights as men including 2016. We know they're always disadvantaged. So it is not their fault. It is the society's fault if the society the way it is designed is not giving them equal opportunity. There is a movie coming up the Birth of a Nation.\n\nIt's about how and I have not seen anything. I just saw a clip on one of those talk show. They said that in the slavery days a black child and white child will be playing together till the age of about 11. About 11 they will decide that only now the black child has reached highest of his or her development. So he doesn't need to be sent to school or do anything about it. He can now start working.\n\nWhite child will continue in his development of learning and going to school. So now is that something you consider a pap. Yoni because the child is born in that yoni or the society is not giving him an opportunity. Bhagavan said the society which has not given them the opportunity they deserve opportunity rightfully theirs which is their birthright we are not giving them. You see, even though you are born in that class of people who are disadvantaged, you have equal right to achieve the highest potential that you have in those days. And even today, today there are classes which are disadvantaged.\n\nTriya Vaishya, Tatak Shudra women by history, everybody can vouch for it that they never had the equal rights.",
      "reflection": "The Gita promises that sincere, heartfelt offering is always received. Today, offer something simple—a leaf, a flower, a thought, a moment of gratitude—with your whole heart.\n\nDon't worry about getting it right. What matters is the quality of love behind the gesture, however imperfect. The Lord sees the heart, not the outer form.\n\nConsider: What would change if you truly believed that the supreme Reality is equally available to all, regardless of background, education, or social status? The Gita democratizes spirituality in a radical way."

      "commentary": "So we completed chapter nine and we'll now be discussing chapter 10, Vibhuti Yoga. So in the first six chapters we learned about I, the limited being which is part of this Prakriti. Prakriti has three constituent parts. Sattva, Rajasantamas. Everything in this Prakriti is made up of these three Gunas, whichever has the predominance that becomes my nature. So this Sattva is the purity, Rajas is activity and Tamas is inertia.\n\nEverything in this Prakriti is made up of these three gunas. And we have learned the nature of Prakriti in chapter seven. So from up to chapter six we have learnt about us as the limited beings and what is the makeup of our beings. Chapter 7 Onward, we are learning about the nature of the supreme, the Lord. So in the chapter seven we learnt about his lower natures. Bhagavan said this Asthatha, Prakriti, Bhumi, Apah, Anlaha, Kham, Vayu, Mana, Buddhi, Ahanka.\n\nThe eight five great elements, Mind, intellect and Ahanka are the nature of the Prakriti, my lower nature. These are not different from me, but these are my lower nature in a sense, the grosser manifestation which you and I can perceive through our senses. We have discussed that in chapter seven. We discussed Prakriti in chapter seven. Chapter eight said that in Prakriti things are unmanifest in the beginning, then manifest in the middle, then unmanifest again. So Prakriti itself has two aspects.\n\nOne is manifest, one is unmanifest. There is unmanifest, Prakriti. There is manifest Prakriti. Bhagawan said, other than this unmanifest, there is another unmanifest which is my higher. Prakriti, which always remains unmanifest, is the support of all things and beings. So in chapter 8, Akshara Brahma Yoga, we learnt about this unmanifest nature of Purusha remaining unmanifest, it supports everything.\n\nBhagawan said that I'm the origin of all things and beings and I'm also the dissolution of all things and beings. I get confused about my being and therefore I'm not experiencing the very nature of the supreme. The very nature of supreme is Sat chit In Ananda very nature of the self is Sat existence, chit knowledge and Ananda happiness bliss. So right now neither I'm experiencing Sat. I know I exist but I'm afraid I'll be non existent. I'm not experiencing Satan cheat.\n\nI'm not experiencing. I know something but I don't know everything. So I'm not experiencing cheat either. In Ananda is my biggest problem. Happiness comes and goes. For a while I'm happy and most of the time I'm just pursuing happiness.\n\nSo I'm trying to get out of the impermanence nature of Ananda into the permanent nature of Ananda. In trying to find out where is that permanent Ananda. The happiness Bhagavan in ninth chapter says that's the roll secret. That the greatest secret. It is your very nature to be Sat chit in Ananda but you are not experiencing it. That knowledge which connects me back to my real nature is the royal knowledge.\n\nSo that was chapter nine. At the end of chapter nine, Bhagavan said the only way one can experience this is Manmana Bhava. Make your mind focused on me. Offer yourself to me. Make me as your goal Yuktva Mat Parayanaha. In other words, completely identify with me and you will experience that Ananda which you are seeking.\n\nNow how do I get to that level where I can completely identify with him is the subject of chapter 10. So it's called Vibhuti Yoga. Yoga of divine glories. I see, perceive, touch and feel this world of my experiences. But I break them all down into perishable things and beings. Anything which I see, I can say I understand this.\n\nThis is just a table. All this, I understand this. Well, I understand this is plant kingdom. So I break this down into the impermanent, perishable conglomeration of things and beings which by very nature they are impermanent and not divine. I don't consider them as divine. I don't say this table is divine.\n\nI don't consider my colleagues as divine. Even when some wise person comes. But he is not Bhagavan. We have difficulty if somebody calls himself Bhagawan because we cannot associate the divinity with the objects of my perception. So how to change that and start seeing Divinity in everything I see and touch and feel is the subject of chapter 10. Therefore it is called Yoga of Divine Glory.\n\nHow to see this divinity, this divine glories in everything and being that I come across in the world of my experiences, my world of my perception. So Bhagavan starts this chapter without waiting for Arjuna to ask questions because he saw that he is enjoying it and he wanted to continue the theme which he started in chapter seven about the Prakriti. When he says, this Prakriti is nothing but my lower nature. Everything in this Prakriti Aa Sesah. There is nothing left in this Prakriti which is not divine. But we don't really see that way.\n\nIn fact, we divide this world into good and evil. We have some level of acceptance that good is divine. But we are difficult when it comes to bad and ugly. I can't associate divinity with it. This chapter will say that even that is only possible. Bad is only possible because of my presence and evil is only possible because of my presence.\n\nThere is nothing that can happen or exist in this world without me. So chapter opens with Bhagavan's statement says Bhuya Eva Mahabaho srunume paramam vacha yatta te aham Priyamanaya vakshyami Hita Kamya. I wish your welfare Hita Kamiya. Therefore I'm going to continue. And in last chapter I told you that this knowledge is available to all. And we discussed that verse which is very troublesome to discuss and say.\n\nThose who are born in Papayonayaha Triya vaishya tathakshadraha. Even they have equal right when they come to me. If they focus their mind onto me. We discuss why Papayoni. Anything which takes me away from my identification with the supreme is sin. That which does not recognize my true potential which is Sat chit in Ananda is Papa.\n\nIt the impurity on my mind which is right now not letting me see who I am. An environment which is more likely to create wrong impressions on my mind is Papa Yoni. Yoni is a collection of people which creates an environment which is similar for each other. So it will be symbiotic relationship. It's like a satsang in a reverse bad company. If I'm put up in that environment that I get more sinful impression on my Mind I have less chance of rising out of it once I.\n\nEven those people, those who are disadvantaged by their environment, by the society they are put in an environment which does not give them the equal right to achieve what they try to achieve. Even they can rise above that. Triya Vaishya Tatakshudra. These people Vaishya says never complained about this verse. Only two people complain. Vaishya didn't say why we are included in it as well.\n\nWe are higher than you now. All business people are worshipped now. Not Dikshatriyas and Brahmanas. So Bhagawan says that at the time of Mahabharata you can say Vaishas were not considered as high as the Brahmins and Kshatriya. I heard when I was growing up. Which profession you are supposed to take?\n\nUttam Kheti Keti Farming. Madhyam Vyapa and Kanishta Nokri. The worst is you want to work for somebody is Kanishta. We all work for corporate and feel great about it. If you can't do farming then only you do Vaipa. So they were considered lower.\n\nNow today you go and tell India you become a farmer. How many farmers are committing suicide? Why do you want me to do farming? But in that society Kshatriyas were farmers. Janakaraj, when he was stealing his land, he found Sidha. Kshatriyas, the kings were themselves were landlords and farmers.\n\nSo those people in that environment they had a great chance to uplift themselves by getting this knowledge. But others did not have that equal rights. Women, Vaishya, Kshudra. But even they can get this knowledge and come to me. But you are a Mahabaho. You are the mighty armed person who has all the opportunities and all the prerequisites to know this.\n\nSo Bhuya Eva Mahabaho again. Listen to my very important words. I think you have come to a level that you are understanding what I'm saying. Manmana Bhava Madh Bhakta Madhya ji Mam namaskaru. I heard Obama saying the other day, stay focused. Don't get distracted by the protesters.\n\nDon't get distracted by your doubts in your mind. Bhagavan says Paramam vacha yate aham Priyamanaya. And I'm only telling those people who likes to listen to this type of knowledge. Vakshyami Hitakami Ayyaa. Because I wish welfare for you all. And therefore I'm telling you.\n\nSo what I'm telling you is what we had started in the last chapter saying. What is the royal secret? Aham Adhi Devanam Maharshinam Chasarva Sah. Neither the Devas in the heavens nor the great Rishis know my origin. What is the source of my being? Not on the great Rishis, not the Devas.\n\nBecause even in Puranas, Devas have their own limitations. Devas are considered pretty greedy. They want to have everything. Devas, they don't know. And Rishis, they are distracted by their own intellect. See, when we learn something, we get to a level where our intellect will become an obstacle.\n\nWe can't experience it because we keep doubting ourselves. So Bhagavan says, even they don't know. Because the source of the Deva and Rishis is me. Swami Dheerananda's very famous example. Batteries in the flashlight. If you're in a dark room and I have flashlight, I can see everything in the room.\n\nBut somebody says, what type of batteries are you using, Neil? I say, well, let me take it out. I take out the batteries. I put the batteries back. Light is back, but I can't see the batteries. I said, I don't know till tomorrow morning.\n\nSo the source of the light in the flashlight is the batteries. And therefore I cannot know through the light of the flashlight the type of batteries I'm using. Through my intellect, which is the Rishi, I cannot know the source of my being. I constantly try to contemplate through my intellect by deduction and inferences who I am. Bhagavan said, you will not know that the Rishis, our intellect, the knower, the seer in us is the Rishi. In the Devas are our sense perceptions.\n\nTo illumine something which is illuminated by my senses. So my senses are the Devas. Without them, the world is not existent for me. You remove the one sense of seeing. The world of sight is gone. You remove the hearing.\n\nThe world of sound is gone. You remove all five senses. The world is illuminated by my senses. So they are Devas through my senses. I am trying to find Bhagavan. I want to see Bhagavan.\n\nI want to see the presence of Bhagavan. In the laboratory, when somebody dies, what happens? Where is that atma is going? The people have done experiments of people dying. And what is it that leaving they cannot find it simply because Bhagavan said, because I am the source of this Deva Dhanda, I am the source of your senses and your intellect. You will never be able to find me through this.\n\nBecause the instrument cannot find its own source. Bhagwan says, aham, Adhi Diwanam, Maharishi Nam Cha Sarvasa. I'm not available to any of those, to the sense perceptions or by intellectual inquiry. I'm only available by contemplation and identification. By identification that I will be able to find myself. Yom Ajam Anadim Chavaiyati.\n\nOne who knows that I am that I. Whichever way you apply it, when applied to the supreme, he is the God1 Bhagawan says I that includes everything.",
      "reflection": "Today, practice 'Vibhuti vision'—looking for manifestations of the divine wherever you are. Excellence in any field, beauty in any form, moments of genuine wisdom or love—all these are rays of the infinite.\n\nKeep a mental (or written) list of divine glories you encounter. At day's end, reflect on how this practice affected your experience. Did the world seem more alive, more meaningful?\n\nThe Gita teaches that a single fraction of God's splendor supports the entire universe. What does it mean to live in constant awareness of that splendor?"

      "commentary": "We have been discussing Chapter 10, Vibhuti Yoga, Yoga of Divine Glories. We have seen so far that Bhagavan is immanent as well as transcendental. Bhagavan is immanent because he resides in the hearts of all beings. Ishvara Sarva, Bhutanam Rudeserjuna Tishtadhi. Ishvara is residing in the hearts of all beings, therefore immanent. But he's also transcendental because we do not recognize him.\n\nThis chapter started out by Bhagavan saying in the second verse, I am not known to anyone. Neither the Devas, the divine beings or or the divine senses know me, nor the Great Rishis know me. He is not known by the mind or the intellect. By applying the normal tools of my cognition, I cannot know Ishwaran. Therefore he is transcendental. So these two aspects of the Bhagavan we have to overcome in a sense, to know Him.\n\nWe have to find altar of meditation. We have completed the first segment of Karma Yoga, culminated in a Dhyana Yoga to meditate upon that supreme Self, my true Self. But what to meditate upon is what we have been discussing since last three chapters 7, 8 and 9. And Bhagawan in various ways told us what his real nature is that I am all pervading. Everything is strung into me. There is no reality other than me.\n\nBut it's still difficult for us to meditate on those aspects of Bhagavan. So the Vibhuti Yoga, the glories of the Lord, are required to meditate upon, to focus on. Something which I can identify through the limited means that I have, is my mind and intellect. So in this chapter, the Bhagavan is giving us the Vibhuti, that which I can identify and vouch for his presence. It is something like when I am in a deep sleep at night and wake up suddenly if I really want to know whether the sun is outside or not. That means, is it a day or not?\n\nWhen I open my windows and I see sunlight, I do not see the sun, but I see sunlight. The presence of sunlight tells me that sun has risen. The sun is there outside. I may not be able to see sun for various reasons. Maybe a building is blocking my view, maybe so bright that I cannot see it. But the very fact that I can experience the sunlight, it tells me that sun has risen.\n\nIn the same way, if I know the Vibhutis Sri Bhagawan says, if you can identify the qualities which emanate from me, which are my real qualities, then you should be able to vouch for my presence. The Lord resides in all hearts, in all beings, in all things. But I cannot vouch for it right now. So Bhagawan is giving us the tools to realize his presence. So in verse 3, Bhagavan concluded Yomam Ajam Anadim, Chaviti, Loka Maheshwaram. I am not known to the Devas.\n\nI am also not known to the Rishis, the great sages. I am not known through intellect nor I am known through mind. However, if one knows that I am Ajam Anadim, I am the source of all being. I am birthless and beginningless. It is uncaused, caused, then it is birthless. There is nothing before me.\n\nTherefore there is nothing is causing my existence. And also I'm beginningless because there's nothing before me. Loka Maheshwaram, the Lord of all the entire creation is there because of me. Because of the entity which is beginningless and birthless, the entire Jagat exists, the Bhagavan, the Lord Ishvara is the material cause and efficient cause for this Jagat. When he created this universe out of his own Maya, there was no other material available to him. From his own self, from his own qualities.\n\nHe provided the material as well as the knowledge, the efficient cause to create this Jagat. So the creation, if it all comes out of he is the Loka Maheshram. He is the Lord of all the beings. Lord is the one on whom my existence depends. So my Lord is my own consciousness. Without that, my existence as this limited being does not exist.\n\nThe day consciousness is not there, I will not be nil Bhatt. I'll be just a dead body. So Bhagavan said Asammudasam, the one who is not deluded by these appearances, he will be relieved of all the sins. In other words, all the ignorances, all the ignorant ideas that I have about myself as a limited being, I'll be liberated from. And then he enumerate those 20 qualities of that supreme Being, the divinity. That these qualities in people, in things and being exists because of my presence, those qualities are somewhat easy to understand.\n\nBuddhi, Gnanam, Asamoha, Shamah, Satyam, Damaha, Shamaha, Buddhi, intellect, Nischayatmika, Buddhi. That which decides what is right and wrong is Buddhi. So when I feel that I'm exhibiting my Buddha because I can decide it is day and not night, that's my Buddhi. Bhagavan says that because of my presence in you, this Buddhi exists in you at the microcosm. This Buddhi I use for deciding what's outside in this world. Gnanam this Buddhi now gives me knowledge what is real and what is unreal.\n\nAsammoha and non illusion. When I have Buddhi and I apply it to find out whether it is day outside or night, when I wake up, it gives me non illusion. Even though it was dark in my room, there is no difference between day and night in my room. But as soon as I open the window, I knew it's a day outside. That is because of my Buddhi that if there is sunlight outside, the sun has risen and therefore it is a day. So that created a Samohaha.\n\nNon illusion, no delusion, no confusion. Out of these three, I developed other qualities such as Satyam, Dhamah, Shama Shama, forgiveness, Satyam, truth, Dhammaha, control of Indriya and Shamaha is control of mind. We've seen in Tatva, Bodh, Shamah, Mano, Vigraha, the Addict, Samah and then Dhammaha is control of the senses such as eyes, ears, control of those Shama and Satyam Shama is forgiveness. If I see that somebody is not yet convinced that it's a day outside. Even though I have concluded that it is day outside. But if my wife doesn't agree with me, then I forgive her.\n\nI think she has not seen outside yet. Because of my knowledge, my Buddhi is in my non delusion. I can forgive other people who are still not at that level. She has not woken up completely. She cannot see the light outside, see things, it's still night. I can forgive her because of my knowledge.\n\nIf I have no knowledge, there will be confused. They will be fighting about it. But because I have knowledge about it, I can have the Kshama and I can vouch for the truth that it is day outside. I can control my actions and also my mind. All this emanating from the same source, my own Consciousness at the vyasti, at the microcosm. I have all these exhibiting through me.\n\nBecause of that divinity, the consciousness functioning through me, I'm identifying with it. Sukham du kam babah abhavah, Bhayamcha, Abhayam evacha. These are the pairs of opposites I have to deal with in this world. This world which I have created out of my own consciousness. In the deep sleep, there was no world outside to deal with. There were no pairs of opposites.\n\nThere was no confusion about day or night. But as soon as I woke up and I have this Buddhi and Gnana exhibiting through me. Now I have to deal with this world outside which has pairs of opposites. So Kannadukha Bhava and Abhava. Existence and non existence, birth and death. Bhayam cha Bhayam Bhaya is a positive emotion which protects me from getting myself hurt.\n\nIf I have no Bhaya of jumping from a third floor window, then I'm going to hurt myself. So this fear of getting hurt is actually protecting me. So therefore it's a positive emotion. And Abhaya and fearlessness. Things which I am very sure about. I'll be fearless no matter what.\n\nSomebody tells me that I do not exist. So things which I so sure about my existence, I'm fearless. Things which I'm not sure about my existence. After my death, I'm fearful. I have fear of death because I have no idea what will happen after my death. I'm fearless about my existence right now.\n\nBecause I know who I am and how I exist exist. So there's both fear and fearlessness emanating from my identification with my consciousness. Ahimsa, non injury, Samatha, equanimity, Tusthi, contentment, Tapaha, disciplines, austerity, Dhanam, charity, Yashaha, Fame and also Ayyashaha ill fame. All these I experience because of my identification with myself as my conscious conscious being. These 20 qualities are given as the glories of that supreme Lord. These are the basic qualities through which he manifests in this world through beings.\n\nHe resides in the hearts of all the beings. And when those beings identify with him, these positive qualities are exhibited through them. Then what about the opposites of this? Like Hinsa, Abudhi, Agnana, Samoha. It is nothing but non identification with the self. When I identify with the Divinity within me, all these positive qualities of the divinity will be manifesting through me.\n\nWhen I'm not identifying with that divinity, then the lack of those qualities will be exhibiting. So the lack of qualities are not really any qualities. They are just lack of good qualities. Something similar to There is nothing called cold but just a lack of heat. Heat I can identify as the form of energy. But cold there is no form of any energy.\n\nIt just lack of heat creates sensation of cold. Lack of Ahimsa creates Hinsa. Lack of Buddha creates a Abuddi Abu, one who doesn't know anything. Lack of knowledge creates ignorance. So the negatives which we see in this world is because of non identification with the true self. Bhagavan said this entire Jagat is created by my own mind using my own self as the material.\n\nMy Maya is the material, therefore he is the Loka Maheshwaram. Without him no world is possible. Without you being conscious of your world, your world cannot exist. Without me being conscious of my world, my world does not exist. And therefore he, the Supreme Lord who is functioning through all beings as their consciousness. He is the Lord of all all the beings.\n\nSo he is justifying why he is Loka, Maheshwaram, Bhavanti, Bhava, Bhutana, Mata Eva, Pruthakvida. These varieties of expressions you see in this world through various beings with all these qualities in the various levels, this permutation combinations, all these 20 qualities creates this multitude of personalities in this world. Somebody has more Buddhi, somebody has more Kshama, somebody has more Ahimsa. All these manifestations in this world through beings. But anytime I see the expression of any of these qualities I must know that divinity is present in that being. Said Bhavanti, Bhava, Bhutana, Mata, Evapratak, Vidaha.\n\nAll these different kinds of qualities of being arise from me alone. Without that one common thread which we call it consciousness, life, none of these are possible. And therefore we should know when we see these qualities that the Lord is present. And therefore when we meet each other, when we see the exhibition of any of these qualities, we have to do Namaste that I see the divinity in you is emanating through you as kindness. All these qualities are nothing but the glories of the Lord and Bhagawan. Meditate on those glories.\n\nThese are your means, the tools for you to meditate on the divine self that you are. Then Bhagavan concludes by giving a complete picture of the creation. Maharsayah, Saptapurve, Chatvarohu, Manamahata, Madbhava Manasa Jata, Esam, Loka, Imah, Prajaha.",
      "reflection": "Today, practice 'Vibhuti vision'—looking for manifestations of the divine wherever you are. Excellence in any field, beauty in any form, moments of genuine wisdom or love—all these are rays of the infinite.\n\nKeep a mental (or written) list of divine glories you encounter. At day's end, reflect on how this practice affected your experience. Did the world seem more alive, more meaningful?\n\nThe Gita teaches that a single fraction of God's splendor supports the entire universe. What does it mean to live in constant awareness of that splendor?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 10, Vibhuti Yoga, the Lord's Vibhuti, that one which appears to be many is His Vibhuti. By his power of Yoga he appears to us as many. So you go to the jewelry shop, the gold is gold, but the Vibhuti of gold with all the jewelries you see, that's the glory of the gold you see in the jewelry shop. And the yogic power is the jeweler who is the yogic power, that efficient cause with which he creates many out of this one gold. So Bhagavan said that I am the source of all the beings in this chapter, but says not many people can realize that. Even the Rishis, Maharisis and the Devas Sura Ganaha, even they cannot recognize that.\n\nThe reason being that I am the source of even those who we consider to be the higher beings, such as Sura Ganaha and Mahari says, and therefore the effect cannot find its own source. All this Saptarisis, sanat, Kumaras and 14 Manus, they're all born out of my mind. In other words, anything which you consider is the source of your being, source of your human race or your existence, all came out of me, born out of my mind. And after that, all the progeny of those are also me. However, it appears to us as many because of our own ignorance about our own self. Now the goal is to unwind that clock from where we started and reached to this point of ignorance and remove that ignorance.\n\nSo, Aham, Sarvasya prabhavah, Matta Sarva pravartate Itimatva Bhajant Buddha, Bhavan Samanvitaha, but one whose intellect is steady, Bhava Samanvitaha, they will see me as I am the source of all the beings and everything is pervaded by me with such understanding and such devotion. One who worship me, they obviously will get me and say Machitta Maggat Pranah Bodhayantah Parasparam Kathayantas Chamam nityam to Sinticha Ramanti Cha what we don't have in our life is contentment and delight. Our life is full of discontent and dejection. One of the Swamijis used to say, our life is like the cardiogram. Unhappiness, Unhappiness, little happiness. Unhappiness, little happiness.\n\nThat's the story of our life. What we're seeking is exactly the contentment. I want to be satisfied, I want to be content. I want to have bliss. Then I want to enjoy my life. That's what we are looking for.\n\nAnd everything we have tried so far in our life has its own limitation. So that what we are lacking. The Bhagavan says, the only people who achieves this is Macchitaha, whose mind is absorbed in me. In other words, I have come to the conclusion the Lord is the source of all the being. And we have seen from the logic of spirituality. That is, this world was created by God, by the only material available to him which is own self.\n\nYou and I cannot be anything different than his own self. With that, if my mind is resting in him always, anything I see, anything I feel, anything I touch is nothing but his self. Machittaha Madgat Pranaha. Everything that is happening with my life, Prana has. Swamiji takes a much wider view of Prana. Any experience which I have through my sense organs is nothing but his experience alone.\n\nBecause I have come to the firm conclusion that this world could not have been created out of anything but the God's own self. There is no other material available to him to create this world but his own self. We constantly remind each other that you and I are nothing but the Lord's only self. It reminds me kind of practical joke. When I was in Dallas group and a lot of Americans who were involved in what I do, they said, neel, I noticed something. You guys always say, hurry home.\n\nChinmay Mission we meet each other and say, hurry home. Jaishu Krishna, hurry home. He said, I know now why you guys have a better family life. You remind each other. You constantly remind each other. Your wife must be waiting.\n\nNeil, go home, otherwise you'll be in trouble. We remind each other, hurry home. Then we won't have any trouble. He said, Bodhiantha Parasparam we constantly remind each other and enlighten others that there is no other self in you, in I, but the same self. That's why Namaste is I bow down to you. The same self which is in me is in you.\n\nBodhiantaha parasparam kathayantas chamam nityam. Constantly speaking about me, constantly reminding ourselves in all our actions that everything that is happening in my life, every experience that I'm experiencing is nothing but the Lord's glory alone to Shinti ramanticha. They're content and they're reveling in their own self. Ramanti in Swamiji weeks and elaborate a distinction between Kridanti and Ramanti. Krida requires an outside object to interact with, to play a ball or whatever. That krida ramanti is reveling in yourself, by yourself you're enjoying is Ramanti jahana.\n\nSo the two things we always are lacking is this contentment and the joy. Bhagavan said, you can only get by your mind constantly focused on the self. All your activities are devoted to the self. Reminding, enlightening each other that we are the manifestation of the same Lord. And then kathayanti cha and speaking about that will lead you to contentment and enjoyment. Dadami buddhi yogam Chenamam payanthite.\n\nThose who do what we have discussed in the previous verse, Bhagawan says, now what my job is. Te sam satati yuktanam Bhajatam priti purvakam Dadami buddhi yogam Tam yena mama upayanti te. I give them the Buddhi Yoga. Those who are doing what we just discussed, constantly focusing their mind into the self. All their activities are dedicated to the self. Enlightening each other and speaking about that they're content.\n\nBecause Bhagavan said, I give them Buddhi yoga. Buddhi Yoga is not this Buddhi that we know as the Mana Buddhi Chitta nahankara. This Buddhi is to decipher the world of objects. With this intellect I try to decide my experiences. Whether this is right or that is right. And I come to that conclusion.\n\nThis is right in this experience. So that is the Buddhi. But this is Yogic Buddha. Buddhi we associate with knowing something. Becoming firmly convicted about something is a Buddhi. Waffling is a mind I like, I dislike.\n\nI know I don't know this or that. One I decisively know that's Buddhi. In this case I now decisively know what my self is. There is no doubt left in my mind anymore. Up till now I had a doubt. What is my relationship with the Lord?\n\nIs he really looking after me or not? Well, I'm doing the does he know that I'M doing his puja. Therefore make sure that we publish it in Bharadwani that I did Lakshmi Puja. Lord, you know that it was published in bharadwani. Now it's your responsibility. Bhagavan said, I give them that Buddhi gives you that contentment and joy.\n\nTe yena mam upayanti te. With that Buddhi yoga they come to me. Our journey started from we separated from ourselves by the ignorance started thinking about this is me, this body is me, this mind is me, this intellect is me. And now at my age, I realize that not this body which I was born with and then grew out of the food, but the steel plate in my leg and the acrylic lens in my eye is also me. No difference between the lens I was born with. I actually asked my Abdulman.\n\nI said, doesn't it come with a lifetime warranty? He said, no, it doesn't. I said, how about this one? He said, this has a limited warranty too. All that I consider me turns out to be something I have borrowed from this world. Bhagavan said, once that awareness takes place that there is nothing but the self exists.\n\nYou know, there is nothing but I exist. That parallax is now removed between my lower self and the higher self. Desaam eb anu kam parthum aham Agnana jam tamah nasayami atma bhavastah gnana deepena bhasvada. So now it seems like that Bhagavan is doing all that very partially to those who put all this effort. And he really doesn't care about people like us who are constantly busy with our business and our studies and our professions and all that. Bhagavan is ever compassionate and all religion says that, including Christianity.\n\nBhagawan is never considered as something who is harshly judging people. He's ever compassionate, but he has his own limitations. Unless I seek his compassion, he does not have any power to give and shower his compassion on you. Let's say I have five children and four of them are never talking to me and only one talks to me. My compassion is only revealed to the one who constantly with me. Other four has never ever experienced my compassions because they never allowed me to show my compassion to them.\n\nSwamiji gives another example. That sun is always compassionate to give you sunlight. But as long as I keep the windows closed, he doesn't have any power to give you compassion. He has to patiently wait outside your window till you allow him to come inside your room by opening the windows. Then he can shower his compassion by giving you the light. It is us where we have to become worthy of his compassion.\n\nSo Bhagawan said, tesham those we just talked about all the qualities they have achieved. Te sam eva anu kam partam aham agnanajam tamah. What has made me feel different from my own self, the God, my own ignorance. The self is self effulgent. It has its own revelation. It becomes revealed to you by its own glory.\n\nMyself, I'm always aware. I'm under whatever condition I know I exist. That requires no intellectual conviction or no intellectual argument about what I exist or not. Everything else require my intellectual conclusion. Am I an architect or a doctor? I come to the conclusion I cannot be anything but an architect.\n\nI never went to medical school. So all these things which my upadi requires my intellectual conclusion that this is who I am, but I exist requires no intellectual argument. It reveals to me that I exist in my awareness. So Bhagavan says, what has removed you from that revelation? That yourself and the God self is one. Your ignorance created by identification with the non self which is my body, my mind, my intellect that created a avarana availing over my understanding that I, I exist.\n\nAnd that veiling once removed, no other efforts are required. Swamiji uses a very good example. I'm looking for my key in the room and the key is lying on the table. But the room is pitch dark. Obviously I can't find my key. But somebody with his compassion turned the lights on.\n\nWith that compassion of turning the light on. And now the light shines on my key and I see my key. The person didn't have to produce a key. But just out of the compassion he removes the darkness in the room and I find my key. It's in the same way Bhagawan said. The self was always dwelling in my own heart.\n\nIt always revealing that I exist. But I consider that I to be this I their existence which I feel all the time. I now take it for granted. It is talking about my body, my mind, my intellect, my achievement, my position, my relationship. That's I. Bhagawan said, with destruction of this ignorance by all the things which you have talked about. I remove that darkness by lighting up Gnanadip in the light of knowledge in your heart.\n\nAnd you come to this revelation that my existence is of that supreme self.",
      "reflection": "Today, practice 'Vibhuti vision'—looking for manifestations of the divine wherever you are. Excellence in any field, beauty in any form, moments of genuine wisdom or love—all these are rays of the infinite.\n\nKeep a mental (or written) list of divine glories you encounter. At day's end, reflect on how this practice affected your experience. Did the world seem more alive, more meaningful?\n\nThe Gita teaches that a single fraction of God's splendor supports the entire universe. What does it mean to live in constant awareness of that splendor?"

      "commentary": " Shri Purohit Swami did not comment on this sloka\n\nWe had been discussing chapter 10, Vibhuti Yoga, Yoga of Divine Glory. In the first six chapters. Chapter two gave us the real indicator of who we are. The paradigm shift in chapter two was you are not the mortal being, but you are the immortal being having mortal equipment. As long as you identify with your mortal equipment, you are mortal. But if you identify with immortal being, you are immortal.\n\nQuest of my life is to exist and therefore the only remedy is to identify with the immortal being and not with the mortal equipment. So the remaining segment of first six chapters dealt with actions because actions is the unit of my interface with this world. So first six chapters give us the pluralistic view of the world and myself. The segment ended with Dhyana Yoga, Yoga of Contemplation, Meditation. How do I now change my worldview from pluralistic to singularistic? The technique is the meditation, but then what to meditate upon will be the next six chapters with 7 to 12, which is that tat aspect of Tattvamasi.\n\nThere are four Mahavakyas we have seen before in Upanishads. One is Prajnaam Brahman. Consciousness is Brahman. That's the very first. Consciousness is Brahman. The next is say I am Atma Brahman.\n\nSo if the consciousness is Brahman, then my Atma is Brahman myself, my consciousness is Brahman. The next one says Tattvamasi, that Dawa, that which you are seeking as immortal existence is you, is your own self. And the last one is aham Brahmasmi. Once that realization takes place, it's oh, I am that consciousness. Gita is elaboration on the third which is Tattvamasi. So the Tattva, that that which I consider right now something other than me, Bhagavan is somebody other than me.\n\nI know all my limitations, all my papas and punyas. Bhagavan has none of those. So he's something other than me. So that is described in 7 to 12. So the seventh chapter was gnana Vignan Yoga of Knowledge and its application. Vignan is Vishishtagna application.\n\nWhen it's applied, it becomes Vigna. So in Gnana Vignan Yoga we got the glimpse of how the reality was that there is a two way to look at the reality. One is the pluralistic view. With the singularistic view. When we look at the pluralistic, it's called Prakriti. The world of manifested universe.\n\nAs we know, where I exist, he exists, he exists, it exists and everything else exists. There's a world of Prakriti. But once it's my lower Prakriti. Because you can perceive, feel and experience through your senses. Therefore it's a lower Prakriti you see. Other than that is my higher Prakriti which is unmanifested.\n\nIt cannot be perceived through your senses that the higher Prakriti. So he said, there are two Prakritis. The source of all the beings and things in this world are these two Prakritis. These two nature of mind, higher or lower. Whether you look at it from a singularistic way or a pluralistic way. So that was chapter seven.\n\nChapter eight was imperishable Brahman. So how do I recognize that imperishable Brahman, that which is the source of all beings. He says, Aham, Krishnasya Jagadha, I am the source of all the things and beings. How do I recognize that self is imperishable? How is given in chapter 8? Chapter 9 was Rajavidya Rajagayo Yoga of Royal Secret.\n\nThe secret is relationship. Less relationship I have with that source. Bhagavan said, I am not in them, but they are in me. All the things and beings which we perceive, feel, touch, interact, react in this world. Bhagawan said, they are in me, I am not in them. Which is totally contrary to what we have heard all our life from our childhood.\n\nBhagavan is in every being. Bhagavan is in your heart, my heart, his heart. Bhagawan says, no, I am not anywhere. They are all in me, but I am not in them. He also turned around and said, but they are also not in me. So it is something for us to contemplate.\n\nHow can that relationship can exist where he is not in me, but I am in him, but I am also not in him. So the analogy we had used before to understand this space in a car. If the space is in the car or car is in the space, BMW or Mercedes is the space in the car or Car is in the space. We clearly know space is in the car. We have already four people. We don't have space in my car.\n\nBut if that's the case, what happened to the space which was in the car when it was manufactured in Germany and sealed tight and transported to United States? What happened to the German space? Did I bring it with me or we left it in Germany? Well, the answer is obviously we didn't import space, we only imported the car. So car must be in this space. Space cannot be in the car.\n\nCar moved in the space. And now if you consider that this space and the car are made up of the same entity called nothingness, then space can say, car is not in me. See, we have difficulty understanding this because we think this is solid world of matter and the space is no matter. But scientists have been trying to find a solid matter in this world and they have not been successful so far. First we thought that you need a matter atom. Then we found out atom is nothing but a hole of space.\n\nThere's nothing in it other than electron or proton. Nucleus must be a solid material. They found out that's not solid either. Yet to find any solid material anywhere in this universe. So if you consider that both the car and the space are made up of the same material, then space can say, car is not in me. So Bhagavan said, I am not in them, they are in me.\n\nThe beings as they perceive, they are in my own self. They are there because of me. If I am not there, they are not there. But they are also not there. Because I have never changed into these beings. Therefore they are also not in me.\n\nThat's my relationless relationship with my Lord. How do I recognize it? As we discussed in chapter nine. But now I'm more confused. Arjuna said, what do I contemplate? I cannot contemplate on nothingness.\n\nAs I said, in architecture, the first exercise was how to perceive space. So if you take space and remove everything out of this space, you cannot perceive space, only perceive space in the relationship of objects. There are two objects in architecture. We used to say we created three spaces. Two positive space and one negative space in between. And that's how you now perceive positive, negative, positive.\n\nIt removes the positive and negative goes away. There is nothing to perceive. So this is my dilemma. People are telling me Bhagavan is everywhere. Bhagavan is everything. But how do I relate to him?\n\nSo chapter 10 is Vibhuti Yoga. Yoga of the Divine Glories. How do I see the divine glories in my world of plurality in the contemplate on the singularity is chapter 10. In the beginning of the chapter, Bhagawan said that do not try with your intellect or your senses. Namay vidhuhu Sura ganaha. Even Devas do not know me or the Rishis Devas our Indriyas.\n\nThat which is illuminating this world for me is my Devas. This world is illuminated by my senses, my world of sight, my world of sound, my world of touch. So you see, with that capability you have, I cannot be known or the Maha Rishis. By Rishis means my intellect. By my thought process of inferring knowledge, even that's not possible. Intellect is not capable.\n\nMy senses are not capable. So Bhagavan Sapita, I will tell you how you should contemplate on me. So he said, Aham Sarvast prabhava matthaha Sarva pravartate. Start thinking first that I pervade everywhere. I am the source of all the being. And Matthaha sarva pravartade ITI mattwa Bhajante Maam Buddhaha Bhava saman vitaha.\n\nThus whoever contemplates on me, he is a wise person. One is endowed with the loving consciousness. He will start with this very notion that he is the source of all being. We will have very difficulty if president of your country is not of your liking and said he is also Krishna's manifestation. Bhagawan said, you have to overcome that. If you don't overcome that, you have failed at the beginning line.\n\nOnly you have to overcome that. Ithimatva Bhajantemam Preeti Purvakam Bhava saman vitaha. With a loving consciousness, I divide my world with world I love and the world I hate. Bhagawan Sai, if you want to know me, this world cannot be divided because it's only me. I cannot hate part of me. I cannot love my right leg and hate my left leg.\n\nMy left leg is as important even though it's broken as the right one. They say if I develop that sense, then only you will be able to know me. So Bhagawan gave that thumbnail sketch of how people can come to Matthittaha Madgat Pranaha Bodhiantha Parasparam. You try to do it by yourself. You may be motivated for a few days. After that you will recede into what you were doing.\n\nBefore, therefore, it is very important to have Bodhiyantaha parasparam reinforce this idea in each other. Satsanga, the glory of Satsangya. This cannot be done by yourself. Gita cannot be read in one sitting. Sit down and say, I learned Gita. When Swamiji used to come to our Swamiji, we have gone through Gita.\n\nSwamiji used to say, has Gita gone through you? So it is very essential that we keep up our enthusiasm about knowing Bhagawan. We are very easy to drop. That somebody says, I finally understood what is the difference between Trump supporters and Trump haters. He said, the basic difference is that Republicans start with saying that human beings are basically bad, you have to improve them. See, your goal is they start out bad, you have to improve them.\n\nDemocrats say, human beings are basically good. They are victims of situations, we have to help them. That's the big difference in the worldview. So they're very similar to what we say about Hindu religion and other religion. Other religions start with the human being is a sinner and he's redeemed him. Hinduism said, human being is a immortal, divine being and you have to purify him if there is impurity on him.\n\nSo Bhagavan here says, whether you start the evil or good, there is a very good possibility of impurities superimposing on you and your enthusiasm. Only way you can make sure is to parasparambodha yantah. Because we see our world through others eyes. If others approve what you are doing, we feel good about it. No matter how sure I am that I am doing good, but others don't approve, I won't feel good about it. Two people working in a warehouse, painting the trusses high trusses.\n\nThey are lazily leaning against each other, painting. One fell down, so other also fell down. Luckily they fell in a heap of garbage, so they were not hurt. They got up, looked at each other. One's face was completely dirtied, others was miraculously clean. The guy whose face was clean, he went to the bathroom, washed his face, then went to work.\n\nThe guy whose face was dirty, he didn't bother, he went straight to work. That was the question. The answer was, they looked at each other. The guy said, his face is clean, mine must be clean too. Let me go and start working. The other guy said, his face is dirty, mine must be dirty too.",
      "reflection": "Today, practice 'Vibhuti vision'—looking for manifestations of the divine wherever you are. Excellence in any field, beauty in any form, moments of genuine wisdom or love—all these are rays of the infinite.\n\nKeep a mental (or written) list of divine glories you encounter. At day's end, reflect on how this practice affected your experience. Did the world seem more alive, more meaningful?\n\nThe Gita teaches that a single fraction of God's splendor supports the entire universe. What does it mean to live in constant awareness of that splendor?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 10, Vibhuti Yoga, Yoga of Divine Glory. In the first six chapters. Chapter two gave us the real indicator of who we are. The paradigm shift in chapter two was you are not the mortal being, but you are the immortal being having mortal equipment. As long as you identify with your mortal equipment, you are mortal. But if you identify with immortal being, you are immortal.\n\nQuest of my life is to exist and therefore the only remedy is to identify with the immortal being and not with the mortal equipment. So the remaining segment of first six chapters dealt with actions because actions is the unit of my interface with this world. So first six chapters give us the pluralistic view of the world and myself. The segment ended with Dhyana Yoga, Yoga of Contemplation, Meditation. How do I now change my worldview from pluralistic to singularistic? The technique is the meditation, but then what to meditate upon will be the next six chapters with 7 to 12, which is that tat aspect of Tattvamasi.\n\nThere are four Mahavakyas we have seen before in Upanishads. One is Prajnaam Brahman. Consciousness is Brahman. That's the very first. Consciousness is Brahman. The next is say I am Atma Brahman.\n\nSo if the consciousness is Brahman, then my Atma is Brahman myself, my consciousness is Brahman. The next one says Tattvamasi, that Dawa, that which you are seeking as immortal existence is you, is your own self. And the last one is aham Brahmasmi. Once that realization takes place, it's oh, I am that consciousness. Gita is elaboration on the third which is Tattvamasi. So the Tattva, that that which I consider right now something other than me, Bhagavan is somebody other than me.\n\nI know all my limitations, all my papas and punyas. Bhagavan has none of those. So he's something other than me. So that is described in 7 to 12. So the seventh chapter was gnana Vignan Yoga of Knowledge and its application. Vignan is Vishishtagna application.\n\nWhen it's applied, it becomes Vigna. So in Gnana Vignan Yoga we got the glimpse of how the reality was that there is a two way to look at the reality. One is the pluralistic view. With the singularistic view. When we look at the pluralistic, it's called Prakriti. The world of manifested universe.\n\nAs we know, where I exist, he exists, he exists, it exists and everything else exists. There's a world of Prakriti. But once it's my lower Prakriti. Because you can perceive, feel and experience through your senses. Therefore it's a lower Prakriti you see. Other than that is my higher Prakriti which is unmanifested.\n\nIt cannot be perceived through your senses that the higher Prakriti. So he said, there are two Prakritis. The source of all the beings and things in this world are these two Prakritis. These two nature of mind, higher or lower. Whether you look at it from a singularistic way or a pluralistic way. So that was chapter seven.\n\nChapter eight was imperishable Brahman. So how do I recognize that imperishable Brahman, that which is the source of all beings. He says, Aham, Krishnasya Jagadha, I am the source of all the things and beings. How do I recognize that self is imperishable? How is given in chapter 8? Chapter 9 was Rajavidya Rajagayo Yoga of Royal Secret.\n\nThe secret is relationship. Less relationship I have with that source. Bhagavan said, I am not in them, but they are in me. All the things and beings which we perceive, feel, touch, interact, react in this world. Bhagawan said, they are in me, I am not in them. Which is totally contrary to what we have heard all our life from our childhood.\n\nBhagavan is in every being. Bhagavan is in your heart, my heart, his heart. Bhagawan says, no, I am not anywhere. They are all in me, but I am not in them. He also turned around and said, but they are also not in me. So it is something for us to contemplate.\n\nHow can that relationship can exist where he is not in me, but I am in him, but I am also not in him.

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 10, Vibhuti Yoga, Yoga of Divine Glories. So we so far up to chapter one through nine came to the one conclusion that everything comes out the one single entity and everything is pervaded by him. And over and over Bhagavan said that you focus on that entity which is permanent, that which never changes. Along with all the changes that is happening in this Sansar, it constantly changing. Everything is changing, including my body, my mind, my intellectual. But they're part of the Prakriti.\n\nBut as long as you identify with this unchanging reality which is all pervading and the source of all the beings, then thou shall be liberated from all your sorrows and limitations. So Arjuna, like all of us, says that I intellectually appreciate this. Many, many Rishis have said this, and now you are also telling me the same thing. But how do I contemplate upon that single entity is still not clear to me. Intellectually appreciating that he is everywhere is one thing, and when encounter a situation which is unconducive, to keep that thought steady in your mind is another thing. And that's why Arjuna said I am having difficulty.\n\nI cannot conceptualize in my mind what is that all pervading entity is all about. You need to give me some pointers. Something which I can tangibly can relate to, which I can conceptualize in my mind, in my meditation, in my contemplation, where I can hang on to that entity as the divine entity, as the one all pervading entity. And then I may make some progress. So tell me all your glories without leaving anything behind, because I never get tired of listening to it. You tell me all these times.\n\nSo tell me what is it that I should be looking for in this universe which I can identify as your manifestation? Everything I see right now, even though I have understood, come very short of being divine. So what should I focus on? So in response to that, we have this next 22 verses which Bhagavan gives Various pointers to meditate upon. It is not very clear to us how to identify divinity. So Bhagavan said, you find divinity in everything that is best among their own spheres.\n\nSo Bhagavan starts his response by clarifying that we are not coming to any new conclusion now, that only the best is where I am, but not the rest. So verse 20, it clearly makes a summary statement that let's not get deviated from what we already talked about, that I am the source of all the beings or seychina without living anything about. But it may be more prominent in some this divinity to identify. So you say aham, atma gudakesha sarva bhuta asayasthitah. So let's make it clear that I reside as the core of all the beings. There is no exception.\n\nJust because we say the one is more manifesting divinity and other is not, that does not mean the other is devoid of my presence. So very first clarification is I reside in all the beings as the core of their beings. Aham adhisha madhyacha bhutanam anta evacha. I am the origin, Adi middle and the end of all the beings. All the beings are part of the Prakriti. They have beginning and end.\n\nThey come from somewhere. They exist in time and space for a while and then they end. But all the time the source of that being is me. I am the one who sustained them during their existence. And I am the one they dissolve into. That you should never forget, Bhagavanji, even in your contemplation, that there is no exception.\n\nThere is nothing which can exist without my presence. But for your question was what to contemplate upon. How can I conceptualize the divinity, the self, which is all pervading, immortal? So I'll give you the pointers as Swamiji says in next 21 verses. Bhagawan gave 75 pointers. It is like something which is obvious we can identify with.\n\nWhen the lights are on in this room, we know the electricity is there. When lights were off, electricity was still here. It just was not available for my perception. The electricity always pervades in this room in all this electrical wiring. I can only prove when I show you the presence of it in some manifest form. So the manifest forms rest of the chapter talks about.\n\nAnd because it is given to Arjuna in his time, we obviously walk through several of these Vedic references and Puranic references. Krishna was talking today. He will say, I am the iPhone 7among all smartphones. I'M Google among all technology companies. So we relate to things which are familiar to us. And therefore the analogies given are more in line with the culture at the time.\n\nAnd what Arjuna can identify with, he starts out from the higher, then come down to the level which in a day to day life Arjuna can identify. Adityanam Aham Vishnaho among the Aditya, I am Vishnu. Aditi's sons are Aditya. As Swamiji points out here that Aditi is mentioned in a big Veda. Aditi means limitless. Aditi is mother of all celestial beings.\n\nAnd then in Puranic time, Aditi was also shown as wife of Kashyap Rushi. But from the Vedic point of view, Aditi was the perennial mother, the primordial mother which gives birth to this universe. Celestial beings According to our scriptures and puranas, somewhere the four aditya are mentioned. Somewhere six adityas mentioned. But eventually they settled on 12 adityas. If the word is used singularly, it means Sun.\n\nWhen it mentioned in plurality, it means 12. Aditya somewhat identifies with the 12 months of the year. Each one is in charge of one segment of the. So among the Aditya, Bhagavan says I am a Vishnu. Vishnu is all pervading. Vishnu means who has long reach.\n\nYou can probably say that the one is the longest day in a year. The son which is in charge of that day is Vishnu. But basically saying among all the celestial that becomes very apparent to me is Vishnu because he is all pervading. Consider me as I am Vishnu among all Adityas. Jyoti, Sam Ravihi Anshuman among the luminaries in the sky, those objects or entities were self effulgent. I am the radiant Sun.\n\nSun is something obvious to us. But we can only relate to Sun. Among the luminaries in the sky, I am Sun. Marichihi Marutam Asmi among the winds, wind is air in different forms. It can be hurricane, it can be tornado, it can be storm or it can be a pleasant breeze. Marutas in plurality are in charge of all these different types of winds.\n\nNow obviously in Vedic time, we were reliant on the natural forces. Natural forces are something we are trying to understand. So each natural force is a deity. We came to one conclusion that if there is an activity, there is somebody in charge of the activity. Activity cannot take place unless there is somebody guiding it. If I see an effect, there has to be a cause.\n\nIf I see a wind moving, there is A cause somebody is in charge. Somebody making sure that in this condition only this thing can occur. So marutas were in charge of winds. And each type of wind has a different maruta. The Marichi is among the best because it is the in charge of the pleasant breeze which we can enjoy. We are afraid of tornado, we are afraid of hurricane.\n\nBut we are very happy when this pleasant breeze is flowing. Among all the Marutas, Nakshatranam, Ahamshashi, Nakshatrana, the asterisms or constellations among them all the arrangement of stars in the sky. In Nakshatra, moon appears to be travelling through this star clusters. So when I see at night the sky, the asterisms are dimly lit, but the moon is brightly lit. He seems like the king of all these asterisms. He is traveling through all these Nakshatras, you know, as if the king of all the Nakshatras.\n\nSo therefore he says, among the Nakshatras, I am Shashi. He say, consider me as the sun. Night time I see moon. He says, consider me as moon. If it is windy, consider that my Maruta are working. But when you feel at ease, most at comfort, I am Marichi.\n\nAnd among all the celestial beings, I am Vishnu. Without Vishnu, nothing can exist. So therefore, when you see anything, something which catches your imagination, something that can invoke these divine feelings in you, consider that my presence you are experiencing. The next verse says Vedanam Sama Vedo Asmi. Obviously, Arjuna was a product of a Vedic culture. We consider Vedas the basis of our culture.\n\nIf things cannot have a proof in Vedas, it is not true. Truth has to have basis in Vedas. And obviously we know there are four Vedas. Rug Veda, Sam Veda, Yajurveda and Tharva Veda. Sam Veda is most pleasant. Saam Veda is basically as we have heard all in poetry.\n\nRug Veda is in prose, Sama Veda in poetry. So listening to Sama Veda is most pleasant. Even today if you listen to our Panditji, he is Samavedi. When he chant, it really catches your attention. Chanting normally going on in temple, everybody is talking. You know, when he starts in a Sam Vedi chanting, everybody is quiet.\n\nSomething really unique, something which catches your attention, something which catches your mind is Sama Veda. Among all the Vedas, I am Sama Veda. Knowledge is in all Vedas. But something that can invoke the sense of divinity in your heart is when you have this beautiful Poetry sung in a proper raga. So if the Vedas discussion is going on, if it is not interesting to me, Swami says the Ghata pata Gadabada. You know there's two pandas talking about this Vedic discussion.\n\nThey give example a Ghata and a pata, Ghata and a pata. One who cannot get anything out of it say all this. They spell Gaddapada garbhat. They are doing garbat. That's where the garbhat words come from. Because we can understand what they are talking about.\n\nSo it's a garbhat to us. Even though they may be talking at the highest level. But even the one who has no knowledge of Veda, he listens to the Sama Veda. He will have that divinity experience in his heart. Bharu Bhagavan said, among Vedas, I am Sama Veda Devanam Asmi, Vasavah, Vasava Indra. Among the Devas, I am Indra.\n\nWe know Indra is the king of all the Devas. He is the mightiest, he is the wealthiest. He is the greatest kingdom Splendor. Deva Loka is supposed to be a place for enjoyment. Even the Devas have all these politics among themselves. Who is higher, who is lower.\n\nThey have as much jealousy as us. This is serial Kantosima. Indra's wife Paulami is the bad one and Santosima is the good one. One harasses people and one tries to save people. So among Devas, in other words, even if you reach to a level of goodness, your shortcomings will still be there. If I want to be happy and say, if I become a millionaire or a billionaire, I'll be happy.\n\nAll your shortcomings will be with you when you become billionaire. What is making me unhappy will make me unhappy. Then also just having wealth, just having accomplishment is not a remedy for any happiness or experiencing any divinity. But even when you consider that as the basis of divinity, I am among all Devasam Indra, most accomplished, the king of all. From a material wealth perspective, Indriyana Manasthyasmi. Even in the previous line, he also said among the Devasam Indra Deva means to Dev is to illuminate.\n\nThat which illuminates is the Deva.",
      "reflection": "Today, practice 'Vibhuti vision'—looking for manifestations of the divine wherever you are. Excellence in any field, beauty in any form, moments of genuine wisdom or love—all these are rays of the infinite.\n\nKeep a mental (or written) list of divine glories you encounter. At day's end, reflect on how this practice affected your experience. Did the world seem more alive, more meaningful?\n\nThe Gita teaches that a single fraction of God's splendor supports the entire universe. What does it mean to live in constant awareness of that splendor?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 10, Vibhuti Yoga, Yoga of Divine Glories. So we so far up to chapter one through nine came to the one conclusion that everything comes out the one single entity and everything is pervaded by him. And over and over Bhagavan said that you focus on that entity which is permanent, that which never changes. Along with all the changes that is happening in this Sansar, it constantly changing. Everything is changing, including my body, my mind, my intellectual. But they're part of the Prakriti.\n\nBut as long as you identify with this unchanging reality which is all pervading and the source of all the beings, then thou shall be liberated from all your sorrows and limitations. So Arjuna, like all of us, says that I intellectually appreciate this. Many, many Rishis have said this, and now you are also telling me the same thing. But how do I contemplate upon that single entity is still not clear to me. Intellectually appreciating that he is everywhere is one thing, and when encounter a situation which is unconducive, to keep that thought steady in your mind is another thing. And that's why Arjuna said I am having difficulty.\n\nI cannot conceptualize in my mind what is that all pervading entity is all about. You need to give me some pointers. Something which I can tangibly can relate to, which I can conceptualize in my mind, in my meditation, in my contemplation, where I can hang on to that entity as the divine entity, as the one all pervading entity. And then I may make some progress. So tell me all your glories without leaving anything behind, because I never get tired of listening to it. You tell me all these times.\n\nSo tell me what is it that I should be looking for in this universe which I can identify as your manifestation? Everything I see right now, even though I have understood, come very short of being divine. So what should I focus on? So in response to that, we have this next 22 verses which Bhagavan gives Various pointers to meditate upon. It is not very clear to us how to identify divinity. So Bhagavan said, you find divinity in everything that is best among their own spheres.\n\nSo Bhagavan starts his response by clarifying that we are not coming to any new conclusion now, that only the best is where I am, but not the rest. So verse 20, it clearly makes a summary statement that let's not get deviated from what we already talked about, that I am the source of all the beings or seychina without living anything about. But it may be more prominent in some this divinity to identify. So you say aham, atma gudakesha sarva bhuta asayasthitah. So let's make it clear that I reside as the core of all the beings. There is no exception.\n\nJust because we say the one is more manifesting divinity and other is not, that does not mean the other is devoid of my presence. So very first clarification is I reside in all the beings as the core of their beings. Aham adhisha madhyacha bhutanam anta evacha. I am the origin, Adi middle and the end of all the beings. All the beings are part of the Prakriti. They have beginning and end.\n\nThey come from somewhere. They exist in time and space for a while and then they end. But all the time the source of that being is me. I am the one who sustained them during their existence. And I am the one they dissolve into. That you should never forget, Bhagavanji, even in your contemplation, that there is no exception.\n\nThere is nothing which can exist without my presence. But for your question was what to contemplate upon. How can I conceptualize the divinity, the self, which is all pervading, immortal? So I'll give you the pointers as Swamiji says in next 21 verses. Bhagawan gave 75 pointers. It is like something which is obvious we can identify with.\n\nWhen the lights are on in this room, we know the electricity is there. When lights were off, electricity was still here. It just was not available for my perception. The electricity always pervades in this room in all this electrical wiring. I can only prove when I show you the presence of it in some manifest form. So the manifest forms rest of the chapter talks about.\n\nAnd because it is given to Arjuna in his time, we obviously walk through several of these Vedic references and Puranic references. Krishna was talking today. He will say, I am the iPhone 7among all smartphones. I'M Google among all technology companies. So we relate to things which are familiar to us. And therefore the analogies given are more in line with the culture at the time.\n\nAnd what Arjuna can identify with, he starts out from the higher, then come down to the level which in a day to day life Arjuna can identify. Adityanam Aham Vishnaho among the Aditya, I am Vishnu. Aditi's sons are Aditya. As Swamiji points out here that Aditi is mentioned in a big Veda. Aditi means limitless. Aditi is mother of all celestial beings.\n\nAnd then in Puranic time, Aditi was also shown as wife of Kashyap Rushi. But from the Vedic point of view, Aditi was the perennial mother, the primordial mother which gives birth to this universe. Celestial beings According to our scriptures and puranas, somewhere the four aditya are mentioned. Somewhere six adityas mentioned. But eventually they settled on 12 adityas. If the word is used singularly, it means Sun.\n\nWhen it mentioned in plurality, it means 12. Aditya somewhat identifies with the 12 months of the year. Each one is in charge of one segment of the. So among the Aditya, Bhagavan says I am a Vishnu. Vishnu is all pervading. Vishnu means who has long reach.\n\nYou can probably say that the one is the longest day in a year. The son which is in charge of that day is Vishnu. But basically saying among all the celestial that becomes very apparent to me is Vishnu because he is all pervading. Consider me as I am Vishnu among all Adityas. Jyoti, Sam Ravihi Anshuman among the luminaries in the sky, those objects or entities were self effulgent. I am the radiant Sun.\n\nSun is something obvious to us. But we can only relate to Sun. Among the luminaries in the sky, I am Sun. Marichihi Marutam Asmi among the winds, wind is air in different forms. It can be hurricane, it can be tornado, it can be storm or it can be a pleasant breeze. Marutas in plurality are in charge of all these different types of winds.\n\nNow obviously in Vedic time, we were reliant on the natural forces. Natural forces are something we are trying to understand. So each natural force is a deity. We came to one conclusion that if there is an activity, there is somebody in charge of the activity. Activity cannot take place unless there is somebody guiding it. If I see an effect, there has to be a cause.\n\nIf I see a wind moving, there is A cause somebody is in charge. Somebody making sure that in this condition only this thing can occur. So marutas were in charge of winds. And each type of wind has a different maruta. The Marichi is among the best because it is the in charge of the pleasant breeze which we can enjoy. We are afraid of tornado, we are afraid of hurricane.\n\nBut we are very happy when this pleasant breeze is flowing. Among all the Marutas, Nakshatranam, Ahamshashi, Nakshatrana, the asterisms or constellations among them all the arrangement of stars in the sky. In Nakshatra, moon appears to be travelling through this star clusters. So when I see at night the sky, the asterisms are dimly lit, but the moon is brightly lit. He seems like the king of all these asterisms. He is traveling through all these Nakshatras, you know, as if the king of all the Nakshatras.\n\nSo therefore he says, among the Nakshatras, I am Shashi. He say, consider me as the sun. Night time I see moon. He says, consider me as moon. If it is windy, consider that my Maruta are working. But when you feel at ease, most at comfort, I am Marichi.\n\nAnd among all the celestial beings, I am Vishnu. Without Vishnu, nothing can exist. So therefore, when you see anything, something which catches your imagination, something that can invoke these divine feelings in you, consider that my presence you are experiencing. The next verse says Vedanam Sama Vedo Asmi. Obviously, Arjuna was a product of a Vedic culture. We consider Vedas the basis of our culture.\n\nIf things cannot have a proof in Vedas, it is not true. Truth has to have basis in Vedas. And obviously we know there are four Vedas. Rug Veda, Sam Veda, Yajurveda and Tharva Veda. Sam Veda is most pleasant. Saam Veda is basically as we have heard all in poetry.\n\nRug Veda is in prose, Sama Veda in poetry. So listening to Sama Veda is most pleasant. Even today if you listen to our Panditji, he is Samavedi. When he chant, it really catches your attention. Chanting normally going on in temple, everybody is talking. You know, when he starts in a Sam Vedi chanting, everybody is quiet.\n\nSomething really unique, something which catches your attention, something which catches your mind is Sama Veda. Among all the Vedas, I am Sama Veda. Knowledge is in all Vedas. But something that can invoke the sense of divinity in your heart is when you have this beautiful Poetry sung in a proper raga. So if the Vedas discussion is going on, if it is not interesting to me, Swami says the Ghata pata Gadabada. You know there's two pandas talking about this Vedic discussion.\n\nThey give example a Ghata and a pata, Ghata and a pata. One who cannot get anything out of it say all this. They spell Gaddapada garbhat. They are doing garbat. That's where the garbhat words come from. Because we can understand what they are talking about.\n\nSo it's a garbhat to us. Even though they may be talking at the highest level. But even the one who has no knowledge of Veda, he listens to the Sama Veda. He will have that divinity experience in his heart. Bharu Bhagavan said, among Vedas, I am Sama Veda Devanam Asmi, Vasavah, Vasava Indra. Among the Devas, I am Indra.\n\nWe know Indra is the king of all the Devas. He is the mightiest, he is the wealthiest. He is the greatest kingdom Splendor. Deva Loka is supposed to be a place for enjoyment. Even the Devas have all these politics among themselves. Who is higher, who is lower.\n\nThey have as much jealousy as us. This is serial Kantosima. Indra's wife Paulami is the bad one and Santosima is the good one. One harasses people and one tries to save people. So among Devas, in other words, even if you reach to a level of goodness, your shortcomings will still be there. If I want to be happy and say, if I become a millionaire or a billionaire, I'll be happy.\n\nAll your shortcomings will be with you when you become billionaire. What is making me unhappy will make me unhappy. Then also just having wealth, just having accomplishment is not a remedy for any happiness or experiencing any divinity. But even when you consider that as the basis of divinity, I am among all Devasam Indra, most accomplished, the king of all. From a material wealth perspective, Indriyana Manasthyasmi. Even in the previous line, he also said among the Devasam Indra Deva means to Dev is to illuminate.\n\nThat which illuminates is the Deva.",

      "commentary": "We have been discussing Chapter 10, Vibhuti Yoga, Yoga of Divine Glories. Bhagavan, in the beginning of the chapter made two basic points. All these divine qualities which you see in beings such as Buddhi, Gnana, Asamoha, Samada, Ahinsa, Dana, Bhaya, abhaya, all these qualities emanate from me because of my presence in them that they manifest these qualities. So whenever you see these qualities, know that I am present in that being. So that is one point. And then he said that aham, Sarvasya prabhavah, Mattha sarvapravartha.\n\nThere, there is nothing that is not based in me. I am the source of all things and being, and everything proceeds from me. So Bhagawan has made it very clear that there is nothing which is devoid of him. But Arjun obviously wanted to get examples in his world which he can relate to. So that's what he said. Keshu, Keshu, Bhaveshu, Chintyo, Asi, Bhagavanmaya.\n\nIn what different forms that I see in this world which I can worship as your presence. If I have to find examples of divinity which are worthy of worship, tell me, how do I find them, how do I recognize them and how do I approach them? Therefore, Bhagavan said that when you see anything which is best among that category, consider that's worthy of worshipping. Excellence is worthy of worshipping. Yoga, Karmasu, Kaushalam, Kaushalam, the proficiency is worshipable. Anything which is efficient and proficient.\n\nBhagawan said, consider that is my manifestation. It is worthy of worship. So therefore, Bhagavan has been giving various examples of best among those categories. And we have seen so far as Swamiji explains that Bhagawan started with Vedic examples based rooted in the culture of Vedic period. And then he has given some examples which are common between Vedic and Puranic period. And then he has been giving examples from Puranic period.\n\nIn other words, he's covering all that Arjuna has experienced, ancestral, past, folklore. And then Also the day to day world where I'm trying to find divinity. I try to find divinity in my great culture. Also try to find divinity in the folklore which I've heard from people. And I also try to find divinity in my world. Verses 27, 28, 29 continues in that tradition.\n\nWe are seeing more Quranic examples. The Uchehi Sava sama aswanam, Vidhimam, Amrutod bhavam among the horses Uchesrava which came out of this endeavor of finding nectar. It is the story of churning of the milky ocean to find nectar immortality. But by product of that effort we can call Riddhi and Siddhi. Swamiji explains here. This churning of ocean is nothing but churning your own mind.\n\nOne side is bad and other side is good thoughts. Bad thoughts and good thoughts are churning your mind. What comes out of it are the byproducts I call Riddhi and Siddhi. When we try to achieve the final goal of liberation or immortality or ultimate happiness, whichever you want to call it, we are constantly churning our mind to find that ultimate happiness. In that process we achieve some accomplishments. Those are Siddhi and Riddhi.\n\nWe get along our pursuit of happiness. We have not got the happiness yet but we get some things which are by product of a pursuit of happiness. So me buying a BMW or Albany and Maulik going to Hawaii. You people went to Hawaii and I bought a BMW X5 Hybrid over the weekend. So we covered two bases of my vedantic journey. Now you have to go to Starbucks to complete the third leg of it all that is in pursuit of happiness.\n\nThat's why I want to go to Hawaii. That's why I want to buy BMW. But that is not the end goal. Bhagavan says the end goal is to find the nectar. The nectar is endless happiness without any break in it. That is what we call immortality.\n\nThat is also we call liberation. So this churning of ocean Vidhi maam amrutod bhavam. This flying horse came out of this pursuit of happiness as an excellent achievement from the pursuit of finding something else. They were not looking for flying horse, they were looking for nectar. But what came out flying horse. The best among the horses.\n\nWe become excellent in our profession. That actually was the goal. I want to make more money. Then I became very proficient in my profession. We consider unfortunately that is the goal. That never was my goal.\n\nMy goal was to be happy. But I sometimes become so Enamored by my own achievement that I just stop right there, that I'm the best. So Bhagavan said, among horses, Uche Shravaha, the flying horse which came out of the journey of ocean, Airavatam, Gajendrana both came out of the same pursuit. The white elephant with many tusks came out. Airavat and Cheshrava, the flying horse came. They both came in same pursuit of finding nectar.\n\nThe airavat was given to Indra, but horse was given to Daitya. But both came out as excellent examples of something you can accomplish by your pursuit of finding nectar. Bliss Naranamcha, Naradhipah among men. I am the king among man. When somebody becomes as powerful as one can be, he is called king. Airavat is an example among elephants, Uchesa among horses.\n\nSo in all living beings you find example of excellence. In our culture the king is considered divine representation. Not only in our culture, but all Western cultures also King was considered divine. He is the one who is supporting the whole kingdom by his own action. Therefore he is considered divine. Anything that is excellent among man, among animals, among beings of any kind considered to be my manifestation is worthy of worshipping.\n\nBecause the original question was Keshu, Keshu, Chabhesu. So Bhagavan is giving him various examples. Ayudhanam Aham Vajraha. Not only beings but things. Among the weapons and Vajra. Vajra was conceived by Indra as the weapon which can kill the demon Vritrasur.\n\nHe was the snake in a human form. The snake is generally considered poisonous. So something which is poisonous and in stopping my progress bad thoughts in my mind. So Vhtrasu is my negative tendencies. And to kill that I need a weapon which is powerful and effective. So here Indra to kill Vritrasur wanted Vajra, the ultimate weapon to kill this demon who was stopping the course of rivers.\n\nSo he was someone who was stopping the progress. So Vritrasur can be only be killed by something which is very pious and self sacrificing. So Indra found the Dhiji is the right candidate. He has all the positive qualities selfless in his endeavors. And when the Dichi approached, he agreed to give up his body. And then his bones were used to make this Vajra.\n\nThe meaning of this metaphor is if you have to kill the negative tendencies of your mind, you have to sacrifice. Selfless sacrifice is the only sure weapon to kill the negativity in your mind. Of all the weapons to kill your negativity Bhagwan said, I am Vajra Denunam Asmi Kamaduk among cows. The milch cow was also described in chapter three in verse 10 where Bhagavan said Sahayagna prajasrustva Purvacha Prajapati Anena Prasi vistadvam ishacha asthu isht Kama dhak. In the beginning Prajapati said, I have created Praja in the same time Yajna. This Yajna will be your Kamadhenu.\n\nThis Yajna will be your cow which fulfills all your desires. So the Kamadenu is something which has capacity to fulfill all your desires. And as for Purana, Vasisthta had this Kamadhina. Vasistha had this cow. This cow which can give whatever you desire like a genie in other Arabic tale. Whatever you desire, genie can present.\n\nBhagavan said, kamadhanu is your cooperative endeavors Yajna spirit. When you work together, when you combine your resources of your community, of your family, of your country then you can get whatever you want. Dhienuna masmikamadu. In our culture cow is sacred because cow supports life. In olden days cow provided everything. Cow provided milk for sustaining bodies.\n\nCow also provided bullocks to till the land. Cow also provided cow dung for source of fuel. That cow dung was also his building material to plaster the floors. The cow has ultimate giving capacity that it can sustain life. And and therefore cow is considered sacred. But among all cows Bhagavan said, I am Kama Dhuk.\n\nI am Kama Dhenu which has capacity to fulfill all desires. And as Bhagawana said in chapter three, Kama Denu is your Yajna spirit. When you work selflessly and work together you can fulfill all your desires. Prajanastya Asmi Kandarpah among the progenitor. I am that instinct to create progeny. This instinct, Bhagavan said, is divine.\n\nNormally any sexual instinct we consider it to be negative, not good. Our culture clearly says that's divine. Anything which is natural has to be divine. So this instinct to further your progeny is a divine instinct. Attraction for the opposite sex is put in beings by Bhagavan for a reason and therefore it is divine. Swamiji used to say that if you don't get attracted by opposite sex, go and see a doctor.\n\nThere's something wrong with you. That is something natural and divine. It is how you use it, how you Manage it makes it either divine or devilish. Prajanas chasmi Kandarpaha. Kandarpah is that innate attraction for the opposite sex in you. I am that Sarpanam Asmi Vasukihi.\n\nWe have discussed two types of snakes, Sarpa and naga. Sarpa is the unhooded snake. Hooded snake is Naga. Snakes like pythons and other garden snakes. And they are not many times poisonous. Python can kill you, but it's not poisonous.\n\nThere's a Naga Panchami day at least in Surat where I grew up. All these guys will bring cobra in in their little basket. And my mother will offer milk and give some donation. Naga cobra is poisonous. But Bhagavan said even that poisonous instinct in beings is also divine. Because there is no other source for this poisonous instinct than God alone.\n\nEverything in this world, even though it seems negative from our perspective. When you change the perspective it becomes natural and necessary. I very recently read an article I think in New York Times. Forest fires are necessary for the survival of the forest. Now that was complete revelation to me. Because every time I see forest fire in California on the TV I say why can't they do something?\n\nCan they not figure out how to stop this thing? Or what is the purpose of this? And it really opened my eyes. That article said without forest fire, forest cannot survive because the undergrowth will be so dense the trees won't survive. The forest fires clean up the forest every year now, obviously out of control. Anything creates disasters.\n\nAnd most of the forest fires are man made or man created. They are not naturally created. So anything which I see negative may have been over manipulated by someone. But the actual phenomenon, whether it seems negative or positive, my perspective is natural and divine. So therefore you say Sarpanam Asmi Vasukihi. Among serpents and Vasuki Vasukhi is the smallest snake on Shiva's finger.\n\nAlso used as the rope in churning the ocean. And Vasuki also selflessly volunteered to become that rope which are on the ocean among snakes. And Vasuki who gives his services selflessly for the common good. Anantahacha Asminagana. And among Nagam Ananta Ananta endless. Another name of Ananta Nageshanahaya.\n\nWe have seen Vishnu lying on the sheshanag in a slumber. Lakshmi Ji massaging his feet and Lotus coming out of his navel and Brahmaji sitting on it. So this thousand hooded snake is nothing but my mind. It is thousand different desires in thousand different directions. With that capacity when it is associated with Tamas and Rajas, it has creative urge.",

Keshu, Keshu, Bhaveshu, Chintyo, Asi, Bhagavanmaya.\n\nIn what different forms that I see in this world which I can worship as your presence. If I have to find examples of divinity which are worthy of worship, tell me, how do I find them, how do I recognize them and how do I approach them? Therefore, Bhagavan said that when you see anything which is best among that category, consider that's worthy of worshipping. Excellence is worthy of worshipping. Yoga, Karmasu, Kaushalam, Kaushalam, the proficiency is worshipable. Anything which is efficient and proficient.\n\nBhagawan said, consider that is my manifestation. It is worthy of worship. So therefore, Bhagavan has been giving various examples of best among those categories. And we have seen so far as Swamiji explains that Bhagawan started with Vedic examples based rooted in the culture of Vedic period. And then he has given some examples which are common between Vedic and Puranic period. And then he has been giving examples from Puranic period.\n\nIn other words, he's covering all that Arjuna has experienced, ancestral, past, folklore. And then Also the day to day world where I'm trying to find divinity. I try to find divinity in my great culture. Also try to find divinity in the folklore which I've heard from people. And I also try to find divinity in my world. Verses 27, 28, 29 continues in that tradition.\n\nWe are seeing more Quranic examples. The Uchehi Sava sama aswanam, Vidhimam, Amrutod bhavam among the horses Uchesrava which came out of this endeavor of finding nectar. It is the story of churning of the milky ocean to find nectar immortality. But by product of that effort we can call Riddhi and Siddhi. Swamiji explains here. This churning of ocean is nothing but churning your own mind.\n\nOne side is bad and other side is good thoughts. Bad thoughts and good thoughts are churning your mind. What comes out of it are the byproducts I call Riddhi and Siddhi. When we try to achieve the final goal of liberation or immortality or ultimate happiness, whichever you want to call it, we are constantly churning our mind to find that ultimate happiness. In that process we achieve some accomplishments. Those are Siddhi and Riddhi.\n\nWe get along our pursuit of happiness. We have not got the happiness yet but we get some things which are by product of a pursuit of happiness. So me buying a BMW or Albany and Maulik going to Hawaii. You people went to Hawaii and I bought a BMW X5 Hybrid over the weekend. So we covered two bases of my vedantic journey. Now you have to go to Starbucks to complete the third leg of it all that is in pursuit of happiness.\n\nThat's why I want to go to Hawaii. That's why I want to buy BMW. But that is not the end goal. Bhagavan says the end goal is to find the nectar. The nectar is endless happiness without any break in it. That is what we call immortality.\n\nThat is also we call liberation. So this churning of ocean Vidhi maam amrutod bhavam. This flying horse came out of this pursuit of happiness as an excellent achievement from the pursuit of finding something else. They were not looking for flying horse, they were looking for nectar. But what came out flying horse. The best among the horses.\n\nWe become excellent in our profession. That actually was the goal. I want to make more money. Then I became very proficient in my profession. We consider unfortunately that is the goal. That never was my goal.\n\nMy goal was to be happy. But I sometimes become so Enamored by my own achievement that I just stop right there, that I'm the best. So Bhagavan said, among horses, Uche Shravaha, the flying horse which came out of the journey of ocean, Airavatam, Gajendrana both came out of the same pursuit. The white elephant with many tusks came out. Airavat and Cheshrava, the flying horse came. They both came in same pursuit of finding nectar.\n\nThe airavat was given to Indra, but horse was given to Daitya. But both came out as excellent examples of something you can accomplish by your pursuit of finding nectar. Bliss Naranamcha, Naradhipah among men. I am the king among man. When somebody becomes as powerful as one can be, he is called king. Airavat is an example among elephants, Uchesa among horses.\n\nSo in all living beings you find example of excellence. In our culture the king is considered divine representation. Not only in our culture, but all Western cultures also King was considered divine. He is the one who is supporting the whole kingdom by his own action. Therefore he is considered divine. Anything that is excellent among man, among animals, among beings of any kind considered to be my manifestation is worthy of worshipping.\n\nBecause the original question was Keshu, Keshu, Chabhesu. So Bhagavan is giving him various examples. Ayudhanam Aham Vajraha. Not only beings but things. Among the weapons and Vajra. Vajra was conceived by Indra as the weapon which can kill the demon Vritrasur.\n\nHe was the snake in a human form. The snake is generally considered poisonous. So something which is poisonous and in stopping my progress bad thoughts in my mind. So Vhtrasu is my negative tendencies. And to kill that I need a weapon which is powerful and effective. So here Indra to kill Vritrasur wanted Vajra, the ultimate weapon to kill this demon who was stopping the course of rivers.\n\nSo he was someone who was stopping the progress. So Vritrasur can be only be killed by something which is very pious and self sacrificing. So Indra found the Dhiji is the right candidate. He has all the positive qualities selfless in his endeavors. And when the Dichi approached, he agreed to give up his body. And then his bones were used to make this Vajra.\n\nThe meaning of this metaphor is if you have to kill the negative tendencies of your mind, you have to sacrifice. Selfless sacrifice is the only sure weapon to kill the negativity in your mind. Of all the weapons to kill your negativity Bhagwan said, I am Vajra Denunam Asmi Kamaduk among cows. The milch cow was also described in chapter three in verse 10 where Bhagavan said Sahayagna prajasrustva Purvacha Prajapati Anena Prasi vistadvam ishacha asthu isht Kama dhak. In the beginning Prajapati said, I have created Praja in the same time Yajna. This Yajna will be your Kamadhenu.\n\nThis Yajna will be your cow which fulfills all your desires. So the Kamadenu is something which has capacity to fulfill all your desires. And as for Purana, Vasisthta had this Kamadhina. Vasistha had this cow. This cow which can give whatever you desire like a genie in other Arabic tale. Whatever you desire, genie can present.\n\nBhagavan said, kamadhanu is your cooperative endeavors Yajna spirit. When you work together, when you combine your resources of your community, of your family, of your country then you can get whatever you want. Dhienuna masmikamadu. In our culture cow is sacred because cow supports life. In olden days cow provided everything. Cow provided milk for sustaining bodies.\n\nCow also provided bullocks to till the land. Cow also provided cow dung for source of fuel. That cow dung was also his building material to plaster the floors. The cow has ultimate giving capacity that it can sustain life. And and therefore cow is considered sacred. But among all cows Bhagavan said, I am Kama Dhuk.\n\nI am Kama Dhenu which has capacity to fulfill all desires. And as Bhagawana said in chapter three, Kama Denu is your Yajna spirit. When you work selflessly and work together you can fulfill all your desires. Prajanastya Asmi Kandarpah among the progenitor. I am that instinct to create progeny. This instinct, Bhagavan said, is divine.\n\nNormally any sexual instinct we consider it to be negative, not good. Our culture clearly says that's divine. Anything which is natural has to be divine. So this instinct to further your progeny is a divine instinct. Attraction for the opposite sex is put in beings by Bhagavan for a reason and therefore it is divine. Swamiji used to say that if you don't get attracted by opposite sex, go and see a doctor.\n\nThere's something wrong with you. That is something natural and divine. It is how you use it, how you Manage it makes it either divine or devilish. Prajanas chasmi Kandarpaha. Kandarpah is that innate attraction for the opposite sex in you. I am that Sarpanam Asmi Vasukihi.\n\nWe have discussed two types of snakes, Sarpa and naga. Sarpa is the unhooded snake. Hooded snake is Naga. Snakes like pythons and other garden snakes. And they are not many times poisonous. Python can kill you, but it's not poisonous.\n\nThere's a Naga Panchami day at least in Surat where I grew up. All these guys will bring cobra in in their little basket. And my mother will offer milk and give some donation. Naga cobra is poisonous. But Bhagavan said even that poisonous instinct in beings is also divine. Because there is no other source for this poisonous instinct than God alone.\n\nEverything in this world, even though it seems negative from our perspective. When you change the perspective it becomes natural and necessary. I very recently read an article I think in New York Times. Forest fires are necessary for the survival of the forest. Now that was complete revelation to me. Because every time I see forest fire in California on the TV I say why can't they do something?\n\nCan they not figure out how to stop this thing? Or what is the purpose of this? And it really opened my eyes. That article said without forest fire, forest cannot survive because the undergrowth will be so dense the trees won't survive. The forest fires clean up the forest every year now, obviously out of control. Anything creates disasters.\n\nAnd most of the forest fires are man made or man created. They are not naturally created. So anything which I see negative may have been over manipulated by someone. But the actual phenomenon, whether it seems negative or positive, my perspective is natural and divine. So therefore you say Sarpanam Asmi Vasukihi. Among serpents and Vasuki Vasukhi is the smallest snake on Shiva's finger.\n\nAlso used as the rope in churning the ocean. And Vasuki also selflessly volunteered to become that rope which are on the ocean among snakes. And Vasuki who gives his services selflessly for the common good. Anantahacha Asminagana. And among Nagam Ananta Ananta endless. Another name of Ananta Nageshanahaya.\n\nWe have seen Vishnu lying on the sheshanag in a slumber. Lakshmi Ji massaging his feet and Lotus coming out of his navel and Brahmaji sitting on it. So this thousand hooded snake is nothing but my mind. It is thousand different desires in thousand different directions. With that capacity when it is associated with Tamas and Rajas, it has creative urge.",
      "reflection": "Today, practice 'Vibhuti vision'—looking for manifestations of the divine wherever you are. Excellence in any field, beauty in any form, moments of genuine wisdom or love—all these are rays of the infinite.\n\nKeep a mental (or written) list of divine glories you encounter. At day's end, reflect on how this practice affected your experience. Did the world seem more alive, more meaningful?\n\nThe Gita teaches that a single fraction of God's splendor supports the entire universe. What does it mean to live in constant awareness of that splendor?"

      "commentary": "We have been discussing Chapter 10 Vibhuti Yoga Yoga of Divine Glories. As we have seen Arjuna after listening to the whole discourse from Bhagavan, Nature of the Supreme Self, he said, but I need to know. So in verse 18 he says, Vittarena atmano yogam Vibhutim cha janardhana puyaha kathaya truptihi snowto nastyami amrutam. Tell me again in detail, va janadini, your yoga power and your imminent glory, because I do not feel satisfied hearing your life giving nectar like speech. In other words, he said, give me some examples. So Bhagavan said, divyahi atma vibhuta yah, my glories are divine.\n\nPradhanyadha kuru sreshta na ashya anta vistarashyami. There is no end to this glory, but I can give you some prominent examples. So Bhavan clearly clarified to Arjuna then I'm going to give you some prominent examples. They do not constitute my entire glory, but they will give you some idea of where to see my presence. So we have been seeing many, many examples right from the Vedic period to Puranic period. And Bhagavan is now even coming down to our day to day experiences.\n\nPavanaha Pavatamasmi. Something which we experience in phenomenal nature. Everything and every being is nothing but my own self. Because he said everything proceeds from me and I am the source of all things and beings. There is no other thing which has created this universe. When we see an effect there has to be two causes.\n\nOne is the efficient cause, somebody to know how to make that thing to come into existence. And one is the material to create that thing is that pizza. We need a pizza maker and pizza ingredients. So if you see pizza here, you can't simply say well the pizza just appeared here. We are Chinma mission, we are divine people. We don't need to order pizza.\n\nPizza just appears here. We know that an intelligent person will not believe that. He knows that if there is pizza there, there is a pizza maker and he had the ingredients for the pizza. So the same way, if this world exists, there is the material cause and efficient cause. Material cause is something which we have difficulty understanding. We think if Bhagavan knows everything, obviously he knows how to create this world.\n\nThe problem is where did he find the material? How do we create something? I'm an architect, so I can create buildings. Because I know how to design building. Just knowing how to create building doesn't create building. I need to have materials.\n\nGo to Home Depot or Lowe's to buy that material. Home Depot and say, where do you get materials? We get from our suppliers. So you can go up to the source of the material, where it came from. So in this case, if we find the source of the material which Bhagavan used to create this Jagat you can always say that Bhagavan found the material from X. Then X becomes greater Bhagavan than the Bhagawan who created it.\n\nGo to X and say, where did you get the material From Y. Then the Y becomes greater than X because he had the original material. You know, Y and say, where did you get the material? Z had the material when the Z becomes greater God than Y. So this exercise is futile because we cannot get to the source of the material. You have to come to the conclusion that Bhagavan was the source of the material.\n\nIn Bhagawan, there's only one thing which he did not have to buy, borrow or steal. That is his own self. Everything we acquire in this world, we bought from somebody. We borrowed from somebody. We were stolen from somebody. But one thing I never had to acquire that is my own self.\n\nThat which I call I. I did not acquire it from anywhere. I didn't buy from anywhere. So that's the only material available to Bhagavan. So he created this Jagat using his knowledge of creating this universe as an efficient cause. And he also used the material available to him with his own self. So he became the material cause and the efficient cause for this universe.\n\nTherefore he said, everything proceeds from me and I am the source of all things. However, that is not something for us to easily understand. So give me some examples of glories. It may be difficult to find glory in something which is average. But we can find in something which is really excellent. If you have a water jug and if you just a little salt in it and you taste it you won't know that there is salt in it.\n\nBut there's a lot of salt in it. And you taste it, you know there's salt in it. The Bhagawan has been giving several prominent examples. Sarjanam, Adihicha, Antacha, Madhyamcha Evam, Aham, Arjunah. In the creation for anything which is created and the beginning, the middle and the end, there is no other material to create anything, to sustain anything or destroy anything. The same material which was used to create this Jagat, everything in Jagat in this universe is also created by the same original material.\n\nSo Bhagawan said, any creation you see in this world, I am the beginning, the middle and the end. In verse 33 he says, Aksaranam Akaro Asmi. In previous verse he said, in all the sounds and then one syllable, Om. Because Om is the primordial sound. That is the sound which is the most basic sound out of which all the other variation of sounds come into existence. As I said, it's like three color printing.\n\nThere are only three cartridges in your printer. But when you print a picture, permutation combination of those three colors created this wonderful picture which is a variety of colors. So this aa and M is like the source of all the sounds that we hear in this world is the sum total of all the sounds. The Om out of which the first sound is a. U in Ma signifies creation, O signifies such stance and Ma signifies. So when you close your mouth, it's a ma. I heard Anup Jilotra telling a joke.\n\nHe was teaching a female student. He said, she will do saregami when it comes to maa, she will skip this ma. He said, why are you skipping Ma? He said, ma, I have to close my mouth so my lipstick gets spoiled. So Ma, you are closing your lips signifying the destruction. Aa comes from your belly.\n\nSo that's a creation. Aksaranam akaru asmi. Among the letters I am a. Swamiji also explains that every language, the Alphabet starts with A and without a vowel you cannot make any word. And Swamiji explains that in Sanskrit there is a preponderance of a sound. Therefore it is so sweet sounding language. Among the compound words in Sanskrit, I'm Dwandva.\n\nThose of us who have learned a little bit of Sanskrit, there are several compounding words. I know only one very well. Bahubri samas, yasyakantaha nilaha, Sahneela Kantaha whose neck is blue and Neela kanta, that's a Bahuri samas. So two words, Neela and Kanta, when you combine it With Neel Kant. That's why I remember from my 8th standard Sanskrit that is called Bahu Brahi Samas. Neela is actually almost like an adjective.\n\nIt does not have same value as Kantha. Nila is just the attributes of that Kanta. But as Dvanga samas used two words, they both retain their own identity. Dita, Ram, Sita and Ram both maintain their own identity, their own importance. Therefore Dhvandva is considered the most prominent samas. Bhagavan says among the compound words I am Dhvandva that which retains the value of both.\n\nSwamiji explains here that some commentators have commented that it also may be indicating the self and non self. So this entire world of ours is made up of something which we call it self that is me and something which is not me, which is non self. In Vedanta, this body, mind, intellect are non self. They are not really permanent. I am permanent, I feeling is permanent. This beautiful combination of self and non self which we see in our Jagat where self remains the self and still non self retains its own identity as a plurality in this world.\n\nSo therefore it says Dwandva amongst compound words. I'm Dwandva Aham Eva Akshayaha Kalaha. I am that ever existing time. For he said among the reckoners, Kalaitam kalaham among the measures, I am time. Everything we know is defined in space and time. Indian philosophers have given more importance to time.\n\nThey say time is fundamental. Space is an emergent quality of time. So in that he said, I am the time. Among all the reckon how we measure things, I am time. In all the measurement, time is the most important one. He said I am that infinite time.\n\nIt seems like to us it is flowing and going. But time remains constant. It's our experiences change. Our time starts with the experience of any event followed by the second event. If there's only one event, there is no time. The first event occurs, there is no time.\n\nWe measure time between the two events. Therefore, Swamiji says the measure of time in English is second, not first. There is no time second. So here he says I am that infinite time, not that perceived through your senses as finite time. Dhata aham Vishwato Mukaha and I am also the Karma Falada. I am also the supporter, the dispenser of all your experiences.\n\nI experience as long as I'M alive as long as I'm conscious. So my consciousness is the dispenser of all my thoughts and experiences. Daata Viswato Mukaha Facing everywhere that self which in me. Facing everywhere and getting experience of everything is the same self in you. Facing everywhere, gaining all the experience outside. So when you put it together, Bhagavan is everywhere.\n\nNo matter where you see, he is there. Next verse says mrtyuhu Sarva harascha. I am death among all that takes things away from you. You can lose things in some accident. You can lose things by losing something. Various ways we lose things in life.\n\nWe lose money in stock market. But you see that still you will be left with something. I may lose money, but I'll have my health. I'm out of health, but I'm still alive. So there's something left. You know, I lost something, but when I die, I lost everything.\n\nThere's nothing left for me. Therefore, once I am the death, it takes away everything from you. You cannot take anything with you. Therefore it's a Mrityo Sarva Haraschaham, the greatest taker to take everything that you think is yours. Udbhavastcha Bhavish. The translation in the book is slightly confusing which says, I am the prosperity of those who are to be prosperous.\n\nSwamiji clarifies that's not the really appropriate interpretation of Udbhava. Udbhava means to come into existence. I am the source of all that is coming to be in existence in future. Not only I am the source of all things and beings in present that you see, but I am also the source of everything that will come in existence in future. In other words, past, present and future are just concepts of my mind. There is only one existence and it exists all the time.\n\nAnd therefore anything which is created in that existence is nothing but the expression of the same supreme reality which is all pervading, everlasting, omnipresent, omniscient, Kirtihi Sri wakcha, NRI nam smruti medha, dhrutikshamah. All women can take some pride here. All the good qualities are feminine. It says that I am the feminine qualities. Fame, prosperity, speech, memory, intelligence, firmness and forgiveness. All these qualities are manifest in people because of my presence.",

Therefore it is so sweet sounding language. Among the compound words in Sanskrit, I'm Dwandva.\n\nThose of us who have learned a little bit of Sanskrit, there are several compounding words. I know only one very well. Bahubri samas, yasyakantaha nilaha, Sahneela Kantaha whose neck is blue and Neela kanta, that's a Bahuri samas. So two words, Neela and Kanta, when you combine it With Neel Kant. That's why I remember from my 8th standard Sanskrit that is called Bahu Brahi Samas. Neela is actually almost like an adjective.\n\nIt does not have same value as Kantha. Nila is just the attributes of that Kanta. But as Dvanga samas used two words, they both retain their own identity. Dita, Ram, Sita and Ram both maintain their own identity, their own importance. Therefore Dhvandva is considered the most prominent samas. Bhagavan says among the compound words I am Dhvandva that which retains the value of both.\n\nSwamiji explains here that some commentators have commented that it also may be indicating the self and non self. So this entire world of ours is made up of something which we call it self that is me and something which is not me, which is non self. In Vedanta, this body, mind, intellect are non self. They are not really permanent. I am permanent, I feeling is permanent. This beautiful combination of self and non self which we see in our Jagat where self remains the self and still non self retains its own identity as a plurality in this world.\n\nSo therefore it says Dwandva amongst compound words. I'm Dwandva Aham Eva Akshayaha Kalaha. I am that ever existing time. For he said among the reckoners, Kalaitam kalaham among the measures, I am time. Everything we know is defined in space and time. Indian philosophers have given more importance to time.\n\nThey say time is fundamental. Space is an emergent quality of time. So in that he said, I am the time. Among all the reckon how we measure things, I am time. In all the measurement, time is the most important one. He said I am that infinite time.\n\nIt seems like to us it is flowing and going. But time remains constant. It's our experiences change. Our time starts with the experience of any event followed by the second event. If there's only one event, there is no time. The first event occurs, there is no time.\n\nWe measure time between the two events. Therefore, Swamiji says the measure of time in English is second, not first. There is no time second. So here he says I am that infinite time, not that perceived through your senses as finite time. Dhata aham Vishwato Mukaha and I am also the Karma Falada. I am also the supporter, the dispenser of all your experiences.\n\nI experience as long as I'M alive as long as I'm conscious. So my consciousness is the dispenser of all my thoughts and experiences. Daata Viswato Mukaha Facing everywhere that self which in me. Facing everywhere and getting experience of everything is the same self in you. Facing everywhere, gaining all the experience outside. So when you put it together, Bhagavan is everywhere.\n\nNo matter where you see, he is there. Next verse says mrtyuhu Sarva harascha. I am death among all that takes things away from you. You can lose things in some accident. You can lose things by losing something. Various ways we lose things in life.\n\nWe lose money in stock market. But you see that still you will be left with something. I may lose money, but I'll have my health. I'm out of health, but I'm still alive. So there's something left. You know, I lost something, but when I die, I lost everything.\n\nThere's nothing left for me. Therefore, once I am the death, it takes away everything from you. You cannot take anything with you. Therefore it's a Mrityo Sarva Haraschaham, the greatest taker to take everything that you think is yours. Udbhavastcha Bhavish. The translation in the book is slightly confusing which says, I am the prosperity of those who are to be prosperous.\n\nSwamiji clarifies that's not the really appropriate interpretation of Udbhava. Udbhava means to come into existence. I am the source of all that is coming to be in existence in future. Not only I am the source of all things and beings in present that you see, but I am also the source of everything that will come in existence in future. In other words, past, present and future are just concepts of my mind. There is only one existence and it exists all the time.\n\nAnd therefore anything which is created in that existence is nothing but the expression of the same supreme reality which is all pervading, everlasting, omnipresent, omniscient, Kirtihi Sri wakcha, NRI nam smruti medha, dhrutikshamah. All women can take some pride here. All the good qualities are feminine. It says that I am the feminine qualities. Fame, prosperity, speech, memory, intelligence, firmness and forgiveness. All these qualities are manifest in people because of my presence.",
      "reflection": "Today, practice 'Vibhuti vision'—looking for manifestations of the divine wherever you are. Excellence in any field, beauty in any form, moments of genuine wisdom or love—all these are rays of the infinite.\n\nKeep a mental (or written) list of divine glories you encounter. At day's end, reflect on how this practice affected your experience. Did the world seem more alive, more meaningful?\n\nThe Gita teaches that a single fraction of God's splendor supports the entire universe. What does it mean to live in constant awareness of that splendor?"

      "commentary": "We have been discussing chapter 10. We are coming to the conclusion, chapter 10. So far we have seen that Bhagavan has been hammering on the same idea which had been discussed many times before in Bhagavad Gita, that I am the source of all things and beings. The central theme of Bhagavad Gita is there is unity in diversity. Even though we see things in this world as world of plurality, that each individual is different from each other, each thing is different from each other. But there is a unseen thread running through all the things and beings which are so different from each other because they all come from the same source.\n\nSo there is similarity, there is something which is common to all. That's Bhagavan's basically theme. All throughout the Bhagavad Gita, he had been explaining that in various ways. And we have seen in the beginning of this chapter, Bhagawan has reiterated that Aham, sarvasya prabhavah matta sarvapravartade. I am the source of all beings and everything proceeds from me. It is something like a scientist would say that everything started from Big Bang in our universe, and everything which we see in this universe is nothing but came from the Big Bang.\n\nSo when you and I are nothing but the product of the Big Bang, when there is nothing but hydrogen and helium, now we have all this complex mechanism, complex universe that we are trying to understand. So if somebody comes out and says, that's all good, but explain to me how can I see that evidence of the Big Bang or the source of that Big Bang in the universe, then people can start explaining that what you see in the galaxies, you see the hydrogen in the galaxy, the microwave radiation, it all comes from that original sense. But you still have to go and give some examples. So here Arjuna says the same thing. I understood that everything comes from that supreme reality. You, the supreme reality.\n\nMany sages in the past have said the same thing, and you are also now saying the same thing. I'm not doubting those sages nor I have any doubt in you. But can you give me some examples in my life where I can feel your presence in the world of objects and beings? That's what Bhagawan has given 54 examples, very reluctantly. Okay, alas, I explained all of this, but you still want to know. It's like we all can learn Bhagavad Gita and say that God is everywhere.\n\nGod has no form, God is not a man, he's not a woman. But then the ends it. But I want to Bhagavan's Darshan because we are stuck with our perception of the reality. Our perception is limited by our mind and intellect and our senses. We also want to see Bhagavan in our image which we have created in our mind. Arjuna says the same thing.\n\nShow me evidence of your presence in my world. The Bhagavan has given these 54 examples, starting from all the Vedic entities to Pavranik, and then in the natural phenomena and everything else which you can think about, including some negative ones. Dandaha, damaya, damasmi, and among all the cheating and gambling. So he wanted to convey to Arjuna that I am not just in good, but everything that's seemingly evil to you in your world, that also exists only because I exist. And then the last four _Verses_ are somewhat conclusion of this chapter where Bhagawan says, okay, I have exhausted all examples which I can give you, but there is not really any end to this discussion. You can't continue to say, just give me one more example, just give me one more example.\n\nSo you say, yacha API sarva bhutanam bijam tat am Arjuna. Whatever is the source of anything. Because anything as we have described in this world is an effect. When I see something which I can perceive through my senses, it's an effect. There has to be a cause, there has to be a source. So you see a child, you know there are parents for that child.\n\nA child cannot exist without parents. So the parents are the source of the child. We see pizza, we know there is a pizza maker somewhere. So everything we know has a source. And right now our conclusion is everything has different sources. Wood comes from somewhere, steel comes from somewhere else.\n\nThen all this comes together and we build buildings. Bhagawan here says that whatever you see in this thing, in this world is a being. Being means that which has existence in the being, that which comes into being, which comes into existence in this space and time. I am the source, no matter what you see. Ya PI sarvabhutanam Bijam, Tad Aham Arjun. I am the primordial cause for all things and beings.\n\nWe understand this analogy of a seed and anything which comes out of it. A tree, an animal, a human being from the seed. But in that case, the seed is destroyed. After that manifestation is completed, when tree comes into existence, that seed is gone. But in this case, that seed is immutable. It remains as the support for that manifestation.\n\nSo that cause remains support for the effect. There are three laws of causation, Swamiji teaches. One of them is said, if you remove the cause from the effect, the effect does not remain. You remove the cause from this universe which is the Supreme Being. The universe does not remain. The gold is the cause for gold ornament.\n\nYou remove the gold from gold ornament. Gold ornament does not remain. Naatad Asthi, Vina Yat Shyam, Atmaya, Bhutam, Characharam. Without me, the moving or unmoving cannot exist in this world. Just as if we remove the gold, the gold ornament cannot exist. So Bhagawan has basically concluded that all these examples are given for you to understand and try to train your mind to start seeing things as they are.\n\nThey're all made up of the same material. This universe has one source. Eventually you can trace down the source to that one entity which remains immutable. That the uncaused cause, there is no source for that cause. If you find a source for that cause, therefore can go further and find that source. So it's one point of time there will be a cause which is no cause.\n\nSo therefore Bhagavan said, I am that cause. And without that nothing can exist. You remove that from this universe. It's like in my dream. My own thoughts are the source of my dream. But when I go into the deep sleep, that dream cannot exist.\n\nBecause without my mind, the source there is the dream cannot exist. Bhagawan here says, conclusion of all my examples is I am the ultimate cause. I am the ultimate source of all things. And being no thing moving or unmoving. This is the very efficient way in Vedanta to explain that includes everything when it's the moving and unmoving. So all sentient beings and all inert things, all included in it, thing cannot exist without my presence.\n\nThere is no end to my Vibhuti. You cannot count all the manifestations. If you want to catalog all the manifestations of physical world, in this physical world, even that's not possible. So now we have in our science all this Webb telescope so we can see as far as possible. But let's say you want to catalog all the galaxies and all the stars in this universe. No matter what kind of a telescope you will have.\n\nThere are billions and billions of stars and millions and millions of galaxies. It's almost impossible. And by the time you catalog all of them, the new galaxies are formed and new stars are born, new old stars. It's a continuous change. Therefore, in Sanskrit it's called Jagat universe. But Jagat is that which is constantly changing.\n\nSomething which is constantly changing, there is no end to its manifestation. If it's constantly changing, you cannot count it. But by the time you catalog what you have known, new things come into existence. We were in high school, we thought, if I learn this physics and chemistry, then I'll be good at it. Well, physics and chemistry keeps changing in my own lifetime, so even that is not possible. Na antah asti mama divyanaam vibhuti nam paranti.\n\nBut there is no end to the divine glories, the physical manifestation of myself. But I told you some in detail just because you asked for it. Now you can figure out rest by yourself. Basically you teach somebody how to think, then the person can think himself rather than spoon feeding him. Give them example and then a person can learn on his own how to detect that. If you figure out if you are working in a jewelry shop and you figure out how to test a gold ornament, whether it is gold or not, once you have one example, you can then apply that on any other example.\n\nSo taking all these 54 examples, you have seen the method that anything which you see which has some excellence, that's because of the presence of that Lord. Now I told you all that you should be able to detect this. But in conclusion I can tell you. Yat Vibhuti mat satvam Srimat urjitam eva va tattat eva avagatschatvam mama tej ansa sambhavah. Whatever you see in this world, the world of your experiences, as Swamiji says that Jagat is not just the physical world which is changing outside the world of my experiences, world of my perception that is changing constantly, whatever in your perception, in your experience, you see as Vibhuti mat which has glory or its own excellence, Sattvam existence Sat is which is real, asat which is unreal. So Sattvam one context purity also that which has existence Srimat prosperous And Urjitam energetic.\n\nSo anything which you see in this world, in nature, in society, in your community, in your family, where you see these qualities, you should know that they are all coming from me alone. Tatta Eva Avagacvam Mama Teja Ansa Sambhavam. It's coming into existence because iota of my being. So don't consider that if I add up all this manifestation someday with some supercomputer and add it up, that will be Bhagavan. He said no, no, that will be just an iota of my being. Swamiji gives a very good example that my mind has all the capabilities.\n\nBut once in a while it gets confused or deluded by some random thought. And then it goes into a wrong direction. It creates this scenario which is unrealistic. That doesn't mean I completely have lost all my ability to think. My 99% of my ability is still valid. But right now it's dormant.\n\nIt's covered by the one delusion. But when that one delusion is removed, 100% of my ability will be back. So Bhagavan is Satchitananda is ever pure. But this manifestation, the Prakriti, the world of plurality comes into existence by just one part which creates this disturbance which they call the Hiranyagarva cumulative Vasanas. Of all the beings and things which are in this universe, that one portion is now creating a new world. So when I go to sleep, my world comes to an end.\n\nIn a deep sleep there is no world. I don't exist, world does not exist. But my Vasras are there in dormant form. That dormant vasanas will find the appropriate condition. My body has rested fully. I will wake up and they will all come back and manifest and create my own world.\n\nIn case of Ishvara also, Ishwara remains as pure as Brahman. But all the cumulative asanas of of the Jagat are still in a dormant form.",

      "commentary": "We have started discussing Chapter 11, Vishwarupadarshan Reason of the Cosmic Form. So up till now in Bhagavad Gita we have learned that all of us are trying to liberate ourselves from our sorrows. So in very first chapter we have defined our condition. From my perspective, the life is full of sorrows and joys. But they don't come as cleanly defined as we would like them to be. Sorrows come with little joy and joys come with little sorrows.\n\nEverything that is positive come with little negative and everything negative has some positive in it. The very first chapter defined our condition. To get out of this, we are trying all our means to overcome these limitations. So the first five chapters we define who we are, in what perspective we are seeing our life. Therefore we have this limitation. So we have seen that we are defining ourselves by our accomplishments, our relationships, our ability, and also our limitations.\n\nFrom that perspective, when I see the world, I'm a minuscule being and the world is out there to get me. The world is a vast world out there as the Karma Falada. My actions in this field, of my activity in this world, and I have very limited control over what comes out of my actions. The vast world out there is staked against me as the Karma Falada. And in that situation I constantly try to find what is right and what is wrong, what is appropriate, what is inappropriate, and I can't find a clear definition of what is right and what is wrong. So chapter two onwards, we have seen that why that perspective is not correct.\n\nThat perspective me looking at from a very narrow perspective about myself is creating all this confusion. If I change the perspective from who I am, which Bhagavan clarifies in chapter two that you are not who you think you are. This mortal self is not you, but your equipment, my body, my mind, my intellect and my equipment, but not me. I consider that to be me and associate all its limitations and my limitations. So up to chapter five we have learned what that equipment is all about and how using it in this world effectively will get me to where I want to be, with which is a state of complete bliss. So we learned the art of meditation in chapter six, how to meditate upon that other self which I have not experienced yet, but that's my real self.\n\nSo the quest in the following chapter 7 onward is to define that Self, that self which I have not yet identified with. But identification with that self will end all my sorrows and limitations. So we have learned that that self is the Almighty, all pervading self. That self is none other than the self which I consider to be myself, the one self which constantly reminds me that I exist. That self is the same self as the self outside. But the change of perspective I need.\n\nSo how do I get to that was the topic of chapter 10. How do I now start identifying with that higher self? By seeing that self in everything and every being. In chapter 10, the Vibhuti Yoga, Yoga of Divine Glories, we have learned that Bhagavan says there anything glorious, splendid, powerful, wonderful, you see in this world. Consider that is that because of me, the self in it. So the theme of chapter 10 was that I am the origin and dissolution of all the being.\n\nAham Sarvasya prabhavaha matthaha Sarva Prabhartate. When you take that statement that everything is pervaded by me, it basically tells me that everything is one and the same. Nothing is different than I because the I pervades everywhere. There is no space left. If you say I pervades only in the sentient being, then it is a different story. This I pervade everywhere.\n\nAham Atma guda kesa sarva asyas thetah. I'm seated in the hearts of all being. I'm the core of all, all the beings and things. So we have learnt and have intellectual appreciation. So the knowledge in our life comes from three different sources. One is Pratyaksa Pramana.\n\nYou can keep telling me that it is night outside. You are hallucinating where I personally can see. That's the Pratyaksha Parama. I infer where there is smoke, there is fire. So chapter 10 gave me all the inferences. How can I claim that there is electricity in this room?\n\nI said, don't you see the lights are on. That means electricity is on. It's an inference that does not say that I can see electricity. All my knowledge about electricity comes from inferences. Only heater is on, lights are on, air conditioning working. But my pratyaksa Praman will be.\n\nI put finger in that outlet. No words are necessary. No description is necessary. That's a Pratyaksha Brahman seeing is this is the closest I can come. So over Sastra Sankhya philosophy. Accept three sources of knowledge.\n\nPerception, Pratyaksha Prama, my perception through my senses. I infer from my observation this must be the truth. And third is testimony. Somebody comes and tells me what it is. So most of our knowledge about Bhagavan comes from testimony only so far. My parents told me Bhagavan is like that.\n\nAll religions tell me Bhagavan is all for reading. Swamiji even said Bhagavan is all pervading. Who am I to doubt him? So I'm relying totally on testimony right now about Bhagavan. From a lineage of all the gurus. They are telling about that the Atma is the Paramatma.\n\nWho am I to question them? I have complete faith in them, in the testimony. How does a judge ever decide what is right and what is wrong? Who is guilty, not guilty. He relies strictly on testimony. Because he is hardly ever there at the scene of crime.\n\nMaybe some some very unique case that he happens to be there. Otherwise he is never have any other means of knowledge other than testimony. So that's why taken oath that truth and nothing but the truth. So I can rely on testimony if I trust the testimony. So far we have trusted the testimony of Bhagavan. Aham Atma Guda Kesas Sarva says Chitta his testimony.\n\nHe says so unless we doubt him, we don't have any reason to doubt him. So we say okay, that's fine. Then he said okay, if you don't believe me. Everywhere you see all this power and glory. Because power and glory will not be there if I am not there. So anytime I see something splendid.\n\nAnytime you go to nature, something awesome. Right away you have that sense of awe about the definitive, the nature. How wonderful this nature. Because this exists, there must be God. Because the nature has laws, there must be a lawgiver. And because the laws are implicitly followed, there must be a law enforcer.\n\nWe have never met him. But we know if I jump from the 14th floor window, Mother Earth will receive me. As Newton figured out. But that's still not good enough for me to vouch for his presence. What I want is seeing is believing. So Vishwarupadarshan is the final experience all of us are seeking.\n\nIn spite of my complete faith in Bhagavad Gita and Swami Chinma, only time I can come and tell you Bhagawan exists is if I experience him so. Therefore now Arjuna says Mat Anugrahaa Paramam Guhiyam Adhyatma Sangin Matanughaya Paramam. Out of this great compassion for me, not that I was deserving, not that I did something special, Mother does something for a child, not because child is deserving. Out of complete compassion for the child Yat Paya Uktam out of great compassion for me, you have given me. You told me this secret knowledge about the self. You told me about what the Self is all about.\n\nIn chapter two you told me that you are not that mortal being. You are the immortal being. All beings are immortal. The self in them is immortal. All bodies are destroyable, perishable. But the self in those bodies is immortal.\n\nYou told me this great secret which is only possible if there is a great teacher and a very eligible student is available. Otherwise secret remains secret. Teachers may come and tell you. You will never learn. My delusion is gone by this discourse. This knowledge that you have given me out of your great compassion for me.\n\nSo that confusion about who I am and what my duty. Am I a soldier, a general? Or am I a brother and a grandson and a student? What is more important, my duty as a general or duty as a family man? That delusion is gone. The field of actions changes, but I, the actor remains the same.\n\nSo depending on the field of action, I should be working. I can think about architecture. I can start giving them discourse about Bhagavad Gita. Clients will go away. Their delusion is gone. I now know what is right, what is wrong.\n\nHowever, Bhava Apyayo hi Bhutanam Srutao Vistara Shomaya. Let me also tell you what I understood so far. That Bhava Apya origin and dissolution of beings in Bhutanam Sruta Vistara Somaya. I heard in detail which you told me Kamala Patraaksa Mahatmyam Apicha Avyam that it is the eternal self which is the origin and dissolution. Ishvara the Lord is the resting place and the source of all the beings. Also Mahatmyam Apicha Abhyam.\n\nThen also your great glories. Then I heard you the Isvara. I heard Your glories. He addresses Krishna Kamalapatra as one who is lotus eyed. Now obviously in our culture lotus eyed is considered beautiful. But there is another implication here.\n\nThat you are seeing this world as a lotus eyed. In other words, the lotus remains pure no matter what the condition of its being. You the self remain unattached to all this prakriti that you have in detail described to me how this world functions. But you remain completely detached of that. I understood that part also. I understood who I am, what my duty is.\n\nNow I also understood your nature as the Ishwara and how you remain detached from all the workings of this Prakriti. Evam etad yatha ATH tvam atmanam parameshwara. Thus you have described Eva metat. So be it or so it is. Evam eta yatha atma as you said what we just discussed that you are the source of all the beings and you are the dissolution of all the beings. That includes myself as well.\n\nYou describe to me that you are the source of all the beings. You are the dissolution of all the beings. However, Drastu mitchami I want to say I understood. There is no question anymore. However, I want to say it. The sense of sight is the most dear to us.\n\nBecause seeing is believing. I may close my eyes and I may hear my granddaughter. But that doesn't mean that she is here. Somebody put recording. I want to see what I'm hearing is correct or something else I'm hearing. That's why I want to have the direct experience.\n\nWhere then I can vouch for it that your nature is such. I'm understanding, accepting no doubt from the testimony you have given. And all of this including Narad Muni and Kavi Ushna and all the people we have talked about testimony taken granted inference you told me to see in this world, everywhere you see is me. I also understood that. But I still need my direct experience. Pratyaksha Pramana Drastumi Chami Terupam Ayeshwaram.\n\nThat splendid form of yours where everything is included in it. But just a very narrow perspective. When we look at the photographs of any building, we are only seeing a part of it.",
      "reflection": "Sit for a moment with the vastness of existence—billions of stars, billions of years, billions of beings. Let yourself feel small in the face of it all.\n\nThen remember: you are not separate from this vastness. You are the universe looking at itself. Both the terror and the wonder are appropriate responses to ultimate reality.\n\nThe cosmic vision shows that time devours all things. What would change if you held this truth constantly in awareness? Would petty concerns still trouble you? Would you use your time differently?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 11, the Vishwarupadarshan, the cosmic form of the Lord. In the Beginning of chapter 11, he said, Anugrahaya, out of your compassion for me, you give me this deepest secret about the Self and showed me how to experience that and meditate on it. However, that's not sufficient for me to understand the nature of the self which you have described. They said, my delusion is dispelled. Delusion about myself. When he started in the first chapter saying, I cannot kill these people even if I get killed, Bhagawan said in the second chapter, that self cannot be killed.\n\nSelf in you is imperishable, immutable. The self in you is the same self in everyone else. So that can one who thinks he is a slayer, one who thinks he is slain, both are wrong because it is like within myself, I cannot be slayer and slain of my own self. Arjuna said, now I'm very clear. My confusion about who what my self is, that is gone. However, I'm still at a level where I can comprehend the unity of all beings myself.\n\nI understand, I also can experience yourself. I'm very aware about yourself, I'm very aware of myself. I can now theoretically have understood that as my self is imperishable, yourself is also imperishable. However, that oneness of the self is beyond my understanding. If you really see at this point of the Bhagavad Gita, we are exactly at the same level. All of us who have been sincerely seeking to understand the nature of the self.\n\nAll this is intellectually understood. But when it comes to realizing, myself and yourself is one and the same understanding falls apart from experience. My experience is very different in day to day life. I know everything about myself and how I feel, but I cannot relate to yourself and how you feel. Therefore, Arjuna said, I am very clear. You have also explained to me how the things come into being and how they perishes all comes out of the same self and perishes back into the same self.\n\nIt is very clear to me that however, this oneness of the Lord, the glory of the supreme Self, to be perceived as one and not as many, is beyond my control right now. And that's the hurdle in the path of my realization. Right now I'm in a constant samadhi about myself. This conditioned self which I think is me, no effort requires for me to realize this is me. It's an automatic knowledge. As soon as the baby is born, he or she knows this is her or him and everyone else is someone.\n\nSo that's an automatic knowledge. We're conditioned by that. The conditioned self has conditioned us to think who we are. The knowledge given to us by the sages telling us that no, this conditioned self is not the only nature of yourself. Yourself is omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient. You're just conditioning it and making it limited yourself.\n\nOnce you get those limitations go, you will identify with the Supreme Self. And that's where Arjuna says, I have a difficulty. I can't experience that. I want to experience that form of the self of you. That's because you claim to know that form of the self. I know this form, the self, you know, the supreme form of the self.\n\nI need to see that to get over the hurdle. So he said, drastumi chami te rupam aishwaram purushottamam. O Lord of all the beings. Purushottam, I want to say that form of yours where everything is included in one. I see myself as separate. The world is separate.\n\nThe world of plurality is very easy for me to comprehend. But I want to see all in its totality. That if you think that it is possible for me to see. So Bhagavan said, okay, I think you are ready for it. You come to that level of understanding that the only barrier left is your own intellect. The only barrier left is your own conditioning.\n\nYou accepted fully that myself and the selves of the others is one and the same. By inference, we have come to the conclusion that we cannot be but the part of the same self. If the Lord created this universe out of his Self, no other material he had to create this universe and universe and Lord both exist. What is the material for this universe is the Lord Self. If this Myself is created out of Lord Self, then my self and his self cannot be different. So is the case for everything else which I see.\n\nHowever, that oneness which I should feel, which I am feeling in my own body, in my own limited self, I have complete oneness and never argument about the left hand versus the right hand. No argument on right eye versus left eye. If one is weak, other one takes over. You don't even realize when that happens because there's a complete oneness in it. But that's not happening with my family members or my community members or my one is suffering. To some extent I will do that, but not to the extent where I'll do it for myself.\n\nArjuna said, let me see that oneness. Verse 5 Sri Bhagavan Vacha Pashame Partharu Pani Satasa Athah Sahastra Saha Nana Vidhani Divyani Nana Varana Krutinicha. I will let you see this my form which has hundreds and thousands of forms in it, various types of divine shapes and color. Once you see that, you will see in my own being you will see this hundreds and thousands of forms, the forms which you have seen till now and forms which are not seen in a flash you will see all of that all in one. So you will see hundreds and thousands of form, various colors of various types and various forms. And next one he says Pashya, Aditya, Rudra, Asvinau, Marutahata, Bahuni, Adristha, Purvani, Pasha, Acharyani, Bharada.\n\nHe said, not only that you will see the forms which you are familiar with, you will see the forms which you are not familiar with. Not only the forms and beings which you want to see it in one, but the divine beings which you have been worshipping as someone other than this world. So all these deities which they were worshiping in Vedic time, probably Aditya, Surya, Rudraha, Rudra, basically Shiva, aspect of the Trinity, the destruction, Vasuhu, all these various deities of the nature, Maruta, the wind God, all the gods which you have been worshipping, you will see them also into the same being. Currently your understanding is this is a Mrity Lok. We are the mortal beings, the divine beings, you know. And so we worship the divine beings as the mortals.\n\nAnd they seem to be completely different from myself and the selves of the people in the mortal world. Bhagavan thing, when you see them, those non mortal mortal beings, all will be part of the one self, my own self, your own self. And you will see that then Bahuni Adrishta, Purvani, even before you never imagined or thought about Sacchara and Achara, the moving and unmoving beings you will see or self. Yacha, Anya, Drastum, Ichasi. He says here in this One location, everything complete, everything without leaving anything out. The whole universe centered in one being, including all the moving and unmoving.\n\nAs I said, you will say and whatever else you desire to see all these things plus whatever you want to say. Because see, we always have a conception of divinity. The Hindu will say when Bhagavan will appear to in what form he will come, either Rama or Krishna or Shiva or that also in the same form as we have been seeing in these calendars and pictures. If he comes in a different form, we don't accept him as Bhagavan. He has to have Mugat, all those things. So okay, whatever you want to say, you will say in myself.\n\nHowever, the technical difficulty is you won't be able to see it with your own these natural eyes. I say, natu maam shakya seydrastum anay neva swachakshusa Divyam dadami teksuhu pashame yogameshwaram. No matter how much we are taught new things to look at the world differently, but unless we change our way of seeing things, we'll be always going back to seeing what we're seeing before. To learn new things and to learn to look at this world in a different way, we have to change our perception. So divyam dadami tejaksho. I'm giving you this divine vision means I'm going to change your way of seeing things.\n\nThe way of my seeing things right now may be well, I am this and you are that. After about two generations we call ourselves, we are Indians and they are Americans. Somebody says, are you not American also? You're an American citizen. You had been living here for like 30 years. No, no, I'm an Indian or I'm an American, but I'm Indian.\n\nTill I change my perception of seeing myself as part of this country, as an American, I will never be able to see myself as part of this. Nothing changes, but my perception about seeing things changes. That perception change is very much required for go outside right now. The way you see this world, no matter how much I tell you to see it as one, we can say the space is in the room or room is in the space. I can continue seeing this space in the room till I start visualizing that the space is everywhere in this room. And that visualization has to change.\n\nThe perception has to change for to see what Arjuna wanted to say. So because I'm going to divyadraste. So now Swamiji says that what is that which Right now, between my perception of unity between myself and yourself. These are two things. One is, I am separated from you by the space between us. This conditioned self and that conditioned self has a space between these two selves.\n\nSo as soon as we have this perception of space, we create this world of plurality. This space, just like anything that we can imagine, is an imaginary thing. Is there space in existence? When you put two things, a space is created between two things. If you remove both, there is no space. Space can only be seen in relationship to the objects we perceive.\n\nHow much space is between you and I only can be defined by first defining where you and I are. If you remain you and I, there is no space to be measured. So this space is a conception of my mind. Once I conceived myself as an entity which is separate from you as an entity. The space is created. And then the second thing which separates myself and others is time.\n\nI met such and such person yesterday. But he's not here today. So I'm separated from him by time. My father lived in different time. I'm living in different time. I'm separate by time.\n\nFrom Einstein onward, we know time is nothing but concept of our mind. Time depends on the position of the observer. So when we say we are seeing the same thing at the same time, depending on where you and I are, we see the stars in the night and say star is doing this right now. But we know the light takes many, many years to come here. So what we see today actually existed many, many, many, many years ago. But we consider that in now.\n\nWe consider that in the past. We consider what we'll see tomorrow is in future. Now all this thing is dependent on my station point in life. My time is defined by my conditioning.",
      "reflection": "Sit for a moment with the vastness of existence—billions of stars, billions of years, billions of beings. Let yourself feel small in the face of it all.\n\nThen remember: you are not separate from this vastness. You are the universe looking at itself. Both the terror and the wonder are appropriate responses to ultimate reality.\n\nThe cosmic vision shows that time devours all things. What would change if you held this truth constantly in awareness? Would petty concerns still trouble you? Would you use your time differently?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 11, Vishwarupadarshan. We discussed that after listening to the glories of the divine, we, at least as the seekers, understand how to see divinity in the world of plurality with respect. But at the same token, we all have the exact same issues that even though I can take this thing intellectually appreciate this, I can see the argument about the unity of all things, but that's not my personal experience. My personal experience is something other than that. I do feel very clearly separated from the world as an entity. And that's exactly basically the Arjuna's opening question.\n\nBasically saying that I am completely satisfied with your explanation. Out of your compassion, you give it to me, you explain to me your glory. I also understand that you are the source of everything and you will be the resting place for everything. However, I want to see all that into one. All that vision I need to see. It is a one unified vision where I feel that oneness with this world.\n\nWith that request, obviously Bhagavan said, yes, I can show you that because you are ready. Seeker reaches a point where he really wants to know that that's what I want. Saying that you are at that point that I can show you this. However, no matter how hard I try, you will not be able to see this with this, your normal eyes. In other words, the way you are trained or programmed to see this world as an individual. We are programmed right from our birth as this is me, this individual limited being is me, this body, this mind intellect is me.\n\nOur psyche is programmed to see that way as long as we can see the waves in the ocean as the individual waves, not part of the ocean. Unless you change the perspective, the perception, the paradigm that you will not be able to see. Therefore, for once, you will not be able to see this with your normal eyes. I have to give you a divine Drasthi. Divine eyes, other way of looking at this world than you are used to looking at this. The same thing can be seen by two different people.\n\nOne person sees something in it and other person sees Something else. It all depends on my perspective of how I see things. You know those riddles about what do you see in this picture? You see a glass or you see the two people facing each other? Because either you're seeing the negative space or you're looking at the positive space. So Bhagawan said, I need to change your reason, so I will give you a Divyadrasti.\n\nAnd we obviously know that at the same time, when Arjun gets Divyadrasti, Sanjay automatically gets Divyadrasti because he already had the Divya Drasti given to him where he can see what's happening in the battlefield of Kurukshetra. Not only he can see what's happening physically in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, he can also peep into the minds of the people who are fighting that battle. So you can see what Arjuna sees. He also can feel what the Arjuna feels. But he can see in the narrator to his audience. Once Bhagavan fulfilled his promise and told Arjuna that I will let you see the cosmic form.\n\nIn other words, seeing this entire cosmos as 1, we see the entire cosmos as, at a minimum, 2i and the cosmos. Even though I theoretically know about it, then myself is not outside this cosmos or this world. When I become an observer, I exclude myself from the observed, which is the world. That perception is created. The day I was born, when the first thought about this is me, the I, the ego, was born and associated with this limited being. It excluded me from the anything else which I observe as an observer.\n\nAnd to remove this, I need to first remove the I ness. So the different perception which Bhagavan is giving to him is to combine all these things into one. As we say, the only thing which divides us is the space between you and I, the time between I and the others. You take these two concepts out of my perception. The world becomes a one entity. If there are droplets of water on my table, each droplet has its own existence because this droplet is divided by the other droplet by space.\n\nBut we know it came out of the same glass of water. But once the identification with the droplet is developed, two droplets, individuals and they are apart from each other. Bhagavan said, I need to change your perception. It's not that I'm going to change the world. I'm going to change your perception. With this normal, programmed perception of yours, you will never be able to see oneness.\n\nTherefore, temporarily, I want to take this reason away from you. As long as I'm programmed to see this space as a room space, I will have difficulty in combining this space with the universal space outside. But if I change my perception and look at it from outside, then I can combine this. Good example would be we are walking down the knuckles road and you can see the trees all separated. You go a little further up in the bird's eye view, the streets start coming together. And when you are in 15,000ft in airplane flying from Richmond Airport and look down the Richmond, it looks like one big entity.\n\nEverything becomes part of it. Right now everything is individual. Every building has its own identity, every street has its own identity, every lamp post is own identity. Just going to 15,000ft above and have a view. All these merges into one complex. You go even further up, all things jumbled up into completely one.\n\nBhagavan is taking Arjuna into that 25,000ft view of this cosmos. So then what Arjuna saw, Sanjaya saw through Arjuna's eyes and mind is Sanjay's honest attempt to tell Dhrutarastra what Arjuna is saying. 9, 10 and 11 says evamuktva tatvarajan Maha Yogeshwaro Harihi Darsaya Maa Saparthaya Paramam Rupam Aishwaram. Having said thus that he will not be able to see this with your normal perception. You have to change your perception and I will help you do that. Now say this and oh Rajan O King, the Maha Yogeshwarahari because he was in Mahayogeshwarahari, he could do that to Arjuna because he was the Lord of the Yogas.\n\nRight now I'm connected with my world, with my perception, but the Lord of the Yoga can change my connection with him. So they say that Maha Yogeshwara Harihi Harihi. One who removes the ignorance is Hari. One who is the Yogi who can connect this mundane state of existence with that of this universal state. He is the Lord of the Yoga. He showed Arjuna Dasaya Masparthaya Paramam Rupam Aishwaram showing the supreme form of his being.\n\nBasically it just confirmed that Krishna fulfilled his promise to Arjuna that I'll show you the cosmic form. The next verse is basically his quick attempt to paint what he is seeing through Arjuna's eyes to Dhritarashtra. So therefore he says Anek Vaktra Nayanam Anek Adhut Darshana. When we are overwhelmed by something then we can't really go into detail what's happening here. Oh, I think there's a chaos here. The people are running around.\n\nThe description of 9, 11 the first few hours there is a panic, fear, the cloud, the smoke is coming out. People are running in the streets. Nobody knows what's happening. But generally this is what I can say. First journalist has to narrate to the world what's happening and if it's on radio and not on tv so it says Anek Vaktra Nayanam. I see many mouths and many eyes.\n\nAnek Ad Buddh Darshanam. There are so many wonderful sights. In a sense adhut means something which I have not seen normally. In this one form of the Supreme Being I see many mouths and many eyes and mean many wonderful sights. Anek Divya Abharanam many divine clothes. Divya Aneko Yata Yudham and many divine weapons uplifted.\n\nBecause obviously he's seeing the whole thing on the battlefield. The first thing comes to his mind is the weapons. Many mouths, many hands, many wonderful sights, many different type of clothes and many different weapons lifted. People are ready to kill each other but there are not people here. One being in his Supreme Being. I see all of that all at once.\n\nDivya Mallya Ambaradharam he continues because he doesn't know where to start and where to end. He said many mouse all of this and not only that but I'm saying Divya Mallya Ambaradharam. Typically the things which we notice in this one divine garlands, divine clothes. Divya Gandhanulaipanam with very divine fragrant. All the what you call lepas. Whatever the paste you apply, obviously in our culture you have a lot of paste applying so very different type of the paste.\n\nSarva Ascharimayam Devam Anantam Visuto Mukam Sarva Ascharya Ma', am everything is so fascinating. There's nothing which is normal. I can say they remember last time we went to such and such and it is something similar. I can't really do that. There is no experience which I can relate to this vision of Supreme. That's why he is grabbing word from here and a perception from here and just throwing it at Dhritarashtra and say that's what Arjuna is saying right now.\n\nI don't know whether you can comprehend or not. Divya Mallya Ambaradharam Sarva Aschariyamayam Devam Anantam this divine vision Anantham infinite. It's not something which I can say starts here and ends here. Because Arjuna wanted to see the cosmic form in Krishna. He says, show me your cosmic form. Krishna obviously is finite.\n\nHe stands here and Arjuna stands here and the army is all around him. It's not that this thing is limited in the form of Krishna. Whoever six feet or however tall Krishna was, this is infinite. The reason Arjuna is seeing is infinite. The reason there is no end to it. There is no beginning I can see.\n\nThere is no end I can see. All I see is hundreds and thousands of mouths and legs and clothes and malas and lamps and weapons and wonderful sights. Everything is fascinating. I have nothing I can explain to you. Anandam Vishwa Tomukham facing all sides Vishwa the cosmos it facing everywhere in the cosmos. In other words, this is something cannot be limited to the Krishna's being.\n\nThis vision is beyond any perception that we ever had. We had been discussing Chapter 11, Vishwarupadarsha Yoga of Cosmic Form. So as we had been discussing in Bhagavad Gita that a simple quest in life for any being is to exist. This is a basic instinct. This is what we want to preserve out of everything else is to exist. Therefore, this fear of death, that my existence is temporary, it began at my birth time T1 it will end at my death time T2.\n\nAnd as I always say, those two events are hypothetical. Nobody has ever experienced this too. But I have come to conclusion from the inferences, Anumana. I have seen other people taking birth and I have seen other people dying. Therefore I have come to the conclusion that my existence is temporary. Remember the very old song.\n\nMaybe Anil will remember. Ae zindagi ki mele e zindagi ki melee Dunyame kam nahonge upsource. Hum nahonge upsource. I wish I will be there, but I will not be there. All this wonderful world will continue and I wish I would be there, but I will not be there. That's my biggest fear.\n\nThat's my essential quest in life to exist. And then we heard from Bhagavan in last few chapters.",
      "reflection": "Sit for a moment with the vastness of existence—billions of stars, billions of years, billions of beings. Let yourself feel small in the face of it all.\n\nThen remember: you are not separate from this vastness. You are the universe looking at itself. Both the terror and the wonder are appropriate responses to ultimate reality.\n\nThe cosmic vision shows that time devours all things. What would change if you held this truth constantly in awareness? Would petty concerns still trouble you? Would you use your time differently?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 11, Vishwarupadarsha Yoga of Cosmic Form. So far we have seen in Bhagavad Gita that the quest for each individual is to understand who Bhagavan is. So we try in a different way to conceptualize Bhagavan. And we typically would hear that people want to see Bhagawan as a person. And all philosophers basically tell Bhagavan is not a person, he's not a man, he's not a woman, he's not it, he's not he, he's not she. So how one can conceptualize Bhagavan is a riddle.\n\nIf you see the Abrahamic religions, they forbid any picture of God. What God looks like is not possible. Therefore they say, do not draw. Do not create an image which can falsify the image of God in your mind. Our religion, on the other hand, is a very daring feat to describe bhagawan. So chapter 11, Bhagavan Ved Vyas is a great attempt to describe what Bhagavan would look like if you ever have his darshan.\n\nSo so far we have seen that Arjuna said, I have understood everything you have said that hum Aksaram Brahma Paramam, I am that imperishable being. I am the source of things and beings. I have no doubt he said etat Atha, that means so be it. I understood, no question about it. I'm convinced that this is what your nature is, that you are the source of all beings. But how do I contemplate upon you?\n\nHow do I meditate upon you? Because you told me that meditate on myself, then you will become myself. So Bhagavan Ved Vyas takes us to Arjuna's journey and say, how does he see it? So Arjuna makes a request and Bhagavan grants his request and says, okay, I will show you my total form that nobody has seen before. But you won't be able to see it with your natural vision. So I have to give You a divine vision.\n\nI'll give you a divine perspective. With your perspective today you will not be able to understand this. So I'll give you a divine perspective. Things not changing what it is. When we change our perspective, we see things in a very different light. Things we have only seen from one narrow perspective.\n\nSo right now we are seeing the world from our narrow perspective of I, the limited being. Then conceptualize what would be that greater self. We are part of the plurality. We want to experience singularity. Bhagavan Krishna told Arjuna, I will change your vision. And Bhagavan Bedya has already given that divine vision to Sanjaya.\n\nThat Sanjaya can see everything that is happening on the Kurukshatra. And also everything what Krishna Arjuna sees, he sees. So Sanjaya saw the form and described Dhritarashtra that we have seen in last few verses that he said. Then yes, he granted this vision to Arjuna. He said that Anek vaktra Nayanam, Anek ad Buddha, Darshanam, Aneka Dibya Paranam. Everything I see in my world is included in it.\n\nI see various types of dresses, various types of ornaments, various types of fragrances. All that he is saying is Anek vaktra Nayanam. As we have discussed last time, if I take the concept of space out of my mind by some magic, then everything will lump into one. All hands will be of that one big body of a person. And all hands are his, all mouths are his, all eyes are his. Because now I'm seeing it from my world's perspective.\n\nWe see things always from our own perspective. We see things based on what we already know. So if we have to describe something which you have not seen before, I can only describe to you from the perspective what you already know. Do you know where short pump is? I don't know where short pump is. Do you know where that Walmart is?\n\nOkay, well that's the short pump. You need a short pump to give you a reasonable short pump where to get you to Walmart. And then you can put together in your mind what that short pump should look like. So Bhagavan, now giving Arjuna a reason, Sanjay is putting together in his mind what he has seen in his world. Many mouths and many hands and many different type of dresses and many different type of fragrances. Aneka, Divya, Bharanam.\n\nThen he says, Divya, Mallya, Ambar, Dharam, same thing. Whatever I have seen in my world, I Now see in that form and Sarva ascharimayam Devammanantam everything is very wonderful and infinite. I cannot describe what it is from our perspective. When we try to put together things in one vision, it looks really infinite. We try to find out how wide this universe is. We have to simply say it's infinite.\n\nBecause we can't really imagine. We see the stars, we see the moonkanish. But what is the nature of cosmic infinite Anant? Now if I really take my gaze from my world to the outer world, then he said, what you see is Yadibaha Divi Surya sahasrasya Bhavet Yukpat Uthita. In my world I see one sun rising every morning. And I know the splendor of that sun.\n\nThat splendor is incomparable. In my world, there's nothing I can compare to the sun's splendor. When we design light, designing a surgery room, we have to mimic the sunlight. So you have to come close to the sunlight from your artificial light. You are still only talking about the sunlight. As we experience this far away from sun.\n\nBut to experience the sun where he is and to look at him, it's splendid. We can hardly look at it. See, now you imagine that all the space between all the stars are removed. And all the stars, all the suns in this cosmos, they all come together. The splendor of that entity which is all the thousands of stars together we can look at the sky and look at the stars because they're so far away. By the time the light come to us, it's so feeble, it looks like twinkling stars.\n\nBut if they all come together because you have removed space and time from your mind, they all come together at the same time. Therefore Divi Surya sahasrasya Yadi Bhaha. If the thousands of sun rising in the sky, if you can imagine Sadrusi Sat Basahat Manaha the splendor of that great person Mahatmana, that great soul, great being cannot describe his splendor as like thousand suns are rising in the sky. Because he is stars and he is moonkanish. He is everything that we can think of. Therefore we cannot draw his picture.\n\nBecause everything that I can imagine as part of this cosmos, Bhagavan said, it is me. Then this is my Eightfold prakriti that includes everything they can think of. Bhoomi apah analaha kam vayuhu mana buddhi ahanka. So space is part of that manifestation, everything else I can imagine. Now, if I say that I have Bhagavan's darshan, all that darshan has to come together in one. Therefore it is not possible.\n\nBut what we try to do as human beings, we personify that reason in one person. So therefore he said, bhagavan, I'm seeing this vision in your body. Even in our life, what we do is all the divinity that we can think of or we have imagined of. We assign that to one person. We want to see that in one person. So therefore we say, bhagavan, I see all that in Swami Chinbananda somebody says, I saw all that in Bhagavan Rajneesh, somebody says, because we gather all that conceptualization of divinity into one person, we want to see that in one person.\n\nAnd then we get disappointed because a person by very nature cannot have all the attributes of that entire divinity. But if we change our perspective, then we will be able to see that. So Bhagavan said, yadibaha divi Surya Sahastrasya Bhavet yukpat Uthita Sadrushi saa saad Bhasah Tasya mahat manah. Splendor of that being which represents totality, heirs of thousands of sons. You cannot describe it. Tatra Ekastam, Jagat Krishnam, Pravibhaktam, Anekata, it's all centered into one.\n\nBecause that's what Arjuna asked for. I want to see all that centered into you, all in one. Right now I see them as Pravibhakta, different parts. I know this cosmos exist as nature, as Lord's manifestation, but in different parts I can manage. I can manage to understand. It is your world, his world, her world, my planet, different planets.\n\nThere are different parts of his manifestation. From my narrow perspective, I can understand it. But now he says, Tatra Ekastam is centered into one Jagat Krushnam. The entire Jagat Jagat includes everything. Jagat includes your physical cosmos as well as your emotional cosmos and your intellectual cosmos. Everything that you can think of that the greatness of our Hinduism, it has included in Astra, Prakriti, mind, intellect and ego.\n\nWithout that, your world is not complete. If I can put all this together, one person and what that vision would be, that's what Arjuna is seeing right now. In that Mahatma Deva Devashya Sari re. Arjuna saw in the body of the God of Gods. Krishna is no longer a person. Dhritarashtra can relate to who he knew as the king of Yadavas or Pandava's ally.\n\nBut now he says he's a Deva Devasya, the God of all the gods. So he said, I see the Maruta and I see Rudras, all these Devas, all the deities which he is the God of all those deities. Everything that we have imagined, who has the control over this world, he has control over all of them. Deva Deveshary, Pandavahatada, Pandava Arjuna. Arjuna saw in the body of that God of gods this splendor of thousands of suns blazing at the same time. So what could be the reaction of Arjuna Vishma Yavista overcame by the wonderment?\n\nHe's completely dumbfounded. Rustiroma is here standing on hands. I don't know if the English translation of in our language it's very well used. Goosebumps is the only thing come to my mind in English. He's having goosebumps. He's completely dumbfounded looking at this.\n\nHe asked for it, but did not know what to expect. Now he's seeing in the body of the God of God because he's all that vision is personified in one person. Ristiroma Dhananjaya Dhananjaya again Arjuna Pranasya Silasadvam. Once you have that experience, as soon as you see him, Chamatkar I may not believe anything about when he does Chamatkar, he takes out a Rolex watch and gives you namaskar right there. So Pranamya Sirasadevam, as soon as he realized the nature of this total being is surrendered. We don't surrender right now because we don't think this is all true, even though we kind of learn and all that.\n\nBut when it comes to our life, we say, no, no, I have better control. I have people come to me and say, stop coming to class. I think it was actually giving him less motivation to do things. So right now our motivation in working in a world is we don't have much trust in him. We don't think he can take care of it. I really need to look out for myself, look out for number one.\n\nThat used to be a mantra when I came to this country. Somebody has started and said, think about number one. Number one is you start from thinking about you first, then comes everybody else. Your family, your children, your. Start from you take care of yourself first and then go to. But here he said he realized that he is nobody with whom he is relating to what he is seeing Nobody.\n\nSo Pranaam is Sirasa Devam Dandavat Pranam Only the South Indians do that Dandavat Pranayama Punjabi is doing Mathotic they just put the head on and Gujaratvi yeah Pranamya Sirasadevam, Once you have understood the greatness of who you are relating to, you are completely surrendered to him.",

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 11, Vishwarupadasha Yoga of Cosmic Form. As we have seen so far, in the beginning, Arjuna made the request saying that my delusion is gone now. Out of compassion, you explained to me that you are the source of all the beings. You are the resting place of all the beings. Nothing existing which is away from you. Everything I see is the manifestation of you alone.\n\nSo now my delusion is gone about what is right and what is wrong. However, I would like to see that form of yours in its totality in one place. In the previous chapters we have seen his Prakriti Astada Prakruti. So you can say you can experience, you are seeing it every day. His Eightfold Prakriti, you are experiencing and seeing every day. But I still can't see it in one place.\n\nI basically see as the plurality what I want to see as one entity. Arjuna Singh that's basically what we are all struggling to understand intellectually. We understand what Bhagavad Gita says. When it comes to a day to day life, it is very difficult to comprehend. So Arjuna said, my delusion is gone. I understand Nag, but I want to see it, I want to experience it.\n\nAnd in response Bhagavan said that if you wish to, I will show you, but you will not be able to see it from your present way of looking at the world, the present perspective from your present eyes. You will not be able to see it the way you see the world right now. It will remain divided. Because I see my world right now as I as an individual and everything else individual entities. If I see it that way, I will never be able to see the unity in them. If I change my perspective and see it from the singularity's point of view and include myself into it, then I'll be able to see it.\n\nThat's you have to change your perspective. So I'll give you that perspective. Divyam Dadami te Chakshuhu. I'll give you that vision and then you will be able to see. Having said that, he showed the Swaroopa and Sanjaya was the witness. He confirmed that, yes.\n\nHaving said that, Yogeshwarakrishna showed him his Virata Swarup. And he described on his own what Arjuna Swan said. Aneka Vaktra Bahu, many mouths and many hands, as if there are thousands of suns blazing in the sky at the same time, it's so resplendent and difficult to see. And he also showed us the Arjuna's reaction. And having seen that Arjuna, Pranamya, Sira, Sahadevam, Chamatka Namaskar, as soon as he saw who the Krishna in his real form is, he basically completely surrendered to him. And then what he said is.\n\nNow we are discussing from verse 15 onward, as we have discussed before, the Bhagavad Gita is generally all verses are in Anushtupchanda. Now these verses are in Tristupchanda because they are more to describe. So this is a much longer verses, more words packed into each verse. And this is beautiful poetry or a prayer and describing what is the nature of the Supreme Being. So from Arjuna's perspective, now when he sees that Swarupa, he sees things which are common to his experiences. When we go to any other town, like we went to New York and I say I'll go to Manhattan, what am I going to say?\n\nI'm going to see the buildings, 911 memorial, One World Tower, because that's the world I see is what Manhattan is all about. So now what Arjuna sees in that Swarupa is what he is familiar with. He says, pasyami Devan Tava Deva, Deva Sarvantatham Bhuta Visesanga O Deva. He doesn't say Krishna for Sid, O resplendent Being. I see in your body all the other Devas. In this Puranic culture, we have assigned deities of each sense and those resplendent beings, the Devas, he said, I see in your body all of them.\n\nPasyami Devan, Tava Deva Dehe. In your body I see them all. Tatha Bhuta, we say the Sangana, various groups of other beings, Brahmanam Isam, Kamala, Sanastha, and I see the Lord Brahma. Swamiji looks at it both ways. He said, lord Brahma or say Brahma and Isha Brahma and Shiva, Kamala Sanastha sitting on the lotus. I see the whole creation in you, and I see the Creator himself.\n\nYou are the Creation and you are the creator. I see everything all in one. You Tatahu seems Cha Sarva and all that he sees. So it's like flashing through his eyes. Everything he has learned about divinity in this world, it's flashing at the same time. And also Uragan Cha Divyan and I'll see also the divine serpents.\n\nThe Swami points out here that this is one of the technique the poets use to take you to the most sublime level and then bring you down, all the way down to the lowest of the low. So I see all the divine beings, including the Lord Creator himself, but also all the serpents. So the entire universe, starting from the lowest of the low to the highest of the high. I see in your body at one time. And then he says Aneka Bahu Udar Bhaktanektra. Sanjaya has already described that before to Dhritarashtra.\n\nNow Arjuna himself says that I see infinite hands. Bahu udara, stomachs, Vaktra mouth, Netra eyes, Pasyamitvam Sarvato Anantarupam. I see you facing everywhere. Infinite is now realizing that this is not something I will be able to describe. Infinite mouth, infinite hands, infinite eyes. As we have discussed earlier, once you take the space out of our world and keep all the beings lumped as one.\n\nRight now I have two hands and you have two hands. But when you are together there are many hands. All the hands in this world are his hands. All the legs in this world are his legs. All the mouths in this world are his mouths. He is experiencing that.\n\nBut then he says, anywhere I see, you know, this 360 degree movie, it's projected all over. Oh, you are focused one side and so what happened to the other side? Still the same movie and different parts. But we can't describe where that movie starts and where that picture ends. We actually went to the 911 memorial. They have presentation three sided.\n\nSo people when they enter, they start putting the strollers on those sides as if they're keeping. Then the guy comes and move all those because the movie is going to be in all three sides. Then we are focusing on one wall and then realize, oh, there is some other details I'm missing out on this side. And then okay, what about this side? So then we realized we will never be able to capture all three sides at the same time. It's beyond my capacity to see all three sides at the same time.\n\nSo Arjuna experiencing something even at the much grander scale and say, I will not be able to describe everything that I can see. Pasyami tvam Sarvato Anantarva. I see you everywhere with infinite forms. There is no end to what I see in you. Naantam namadhyam napunah Ta Adim we have learned this before. In previous chapters.\n\nBhagavan himself said that I don't have any beginning, I don't have any end. I am the resting place, everything. Now Arjuna tells him, Bhagavan, that I see you as you are no end, no beginning, no origin. Pasyami Vishweshvara. Vishwaroopa is accepting the fact that you are the Lord of all the universe. And this is your Vishwaroopa.\n\nThis is your infinite form. That which I'm experiencing now is your real nature that you are beginningless. You have no middle and no end. Wherever we stand is ever present. Whatever we left behind is our past. What we have not yet experienced in our future.\n\nBut if we experience all of it at the same time, there is no beginning, there is no end, there is no past, there is no future. So he's seeing this everything in his present. You are the Lord of the whole universe and I am seeing your Viswaroopa Kiritinam Gadhinam Chakrinamcha. And as Swamiji explains here that Arjuna is now recognizing that what he's seeing is not a being outside, but what he always perceived as the Lord is. So Kiritinam Gadhinam Chakri nam Cha Tejo rasim Sarvato Diptim Manantam. I see you with the crown, the club and the discus which is the universal form of Vishnu in his four hands a lotus club, then discus, and then Shankar.\n\nAnd then he is wearing the crown. So one who has the complete control of his self can only wear the crown. Vishnu is the only one who has the complete control of the self. Therefore he wears the crown. That means he has the authority. We wear the crown temporarily.\n\nWhenever I feel I am in authority, I wear my crown. But that only lasts for a limited period of time. My authority slips away before even I realize. Like the cardboard crown in a drama. My authority is like that. Well, I'm on this drama stage.\n\nI have that cardboard crown. As soon as of this stage the crown is gone. Vishnu carries that authority all the time. That's why he is the crown. So he's the lotus which signifies the purity and knowledge. And then he has a conch to wake you up from your ignorance.\n\nAnd if you don't listen to the call for waking up, then he uses his club gada to shape you up. And if you shape up, it well and good. If not, chakra annihilate you, just destroy you. So that's how the creation and maintenance continue. Bhagavan gives you all the chances to shape up. You don't shape up, time will take care of you.\n\nSo Bhagwan said, Arjuna sees that form as the totality, as the kiritinam Gadhinam Chakrinam Cha Tejo rasim Sarvato Diptim Anantam is the mass of radiance. Sarvato Diptim blazing everywhere. The previous verses Sanjaya says, like the thousand suns are blazing in the sky. Here he says the Tejo rasim Sarvato Diptim Manantam Everywhere it's blazing. And Swamiji explains here that what he's seeing is not the light of any sun, but he sees the light of the self, the consciousness, that which illumines everything. Anant Diptim infinite teja.\n\nSo he is experiencing resplendence of the self. Pasyami tvam Durniriksham Samantha. But it is difficult to see. It is difficult to understand the light of consciousness. For me, in light of my consciousness, I understand everything. I see all this thing.\n\nKiritanam Gadhinam Chakri nam Cha through the light of consciousness. But seeing yourself, your splendid being, is difficult to see. From light of my consciousness I can describe everything. But describing my consciousness is not possible. So Dura Niriksham I cannot say it. Duru Niriksham Dipta analar Ka Dtim Aprameyam.\n\nThat light is blazing all around like fire and sun. And it's incomprehensible. He come to the conclusion that what I'm seeing is undefinable. At the same time, whatever I want to see, I'll see in it. Any museum or gallery. We go and see, look at the pictures.\n\nEvery visitor will see something different. In that even in our world, we see what we want to see. We'll never see the things we do not want to see. As soon as we see something which is not conducive, we will run away from that. Many years ago, when I first started working on this forensic lab and medical examiner's office in the first time I met with them and they have statistics about how many people go through the autopsy, how many people who die. And they statistics like one in four persons goes through the autopsy.",
      "reflection": "Sit for a moment with the vastness of existence—billions of stars, billions of years, billions of beings. Let yourself feel small in the face of it all.\n\nThen remember: you are not separate from this vastness. You are the universe looking at itself. Both the terror and the wonder are appropriate responses to ultimate reality.\n\nThe cosmic vision shows that time devours all things. What would change if you held this truth constantly in awareness? Would petty concerns still trouble you? Would you use your time differently?"

      "commentary": "We have completed chapter 10, _Verses_ Yoga, and we'll be now discussing chapter 11, Vishwarupadarshan, the cosmic form of the Divine. So in last chapter, Arjuna had asked Krishna that tell me how I should feel your presence, the presence of the divine, presence of that all pervading self, then how I can meditate upon that. And in response to that, Bhagavan has given him the various examples of excellence in this world from various walks of life for Arjuna, which is also applicable to us, that from our day to day life, from our cultural backgrounds, from our spiritual quest, that we find examples all around us of excellence and feel Lord's presence. As we have discussed in chapter 10, that anytime I see excellence, my mind thinks it is the God's blessings, the grace of God, in other words, the divinity is evident in excellence. So Bhagavan has given various examples for Arjuna and say, when you see this, it will remind you of my presence in all things and beings. I'm not limited to those excellent manifestations, but that's where you will find it easier to experience my presence.\n\nAnd now that Arjuna has heard that, he says that I'm not still experiencing that oneness, that oneness which you talk about all throughout this discourse. I have intellectually appreciated and I've come to the conclusion that that's what it is, that there is a one singular entity pervading this entire universe, which is you, the Supreme Self. But I need to have that experience. I would like to experience that oneness. This is something, as Swamiji explains, is similar to how we scientifically make any concept or a theory knowledge of our own. First I need to gather all the evidences and data.\n\nAnd then once I have gathered all the data, all the evidences, that now I have to demonstrate that that phenomenon exists. I gather all information about how the water is formed. In chemistry classes, two molecules of hydrogen, one molecule of oxygen can create water. But at some point I want to see the demonstration so that in the lab I create that situation and Then see the demonstration how the hydrogen oxygen can create water in a similar fashion. Arjuna has now understood, but he wants to see a demonstration. So the chapter starts with Arjuna Vacha.\n\nArjuna said mat anugraha yaparamam guhyam adhyatma Sangnitam yat tvaya uktam vachasthena Moho ayam vigatomama. With your compassion for me, you have given me this secret knowledge. And as you have said, the that the self is indestructible, imperishable, one who consider himself to be the slayer or the slain in both cases is wrong. There is nothing to grieve over the changes which takes place in this world, including death. Because death is not the end of existence. It is only the existence in the form of this body.\n\nSo moho yam vigato Mama. By this discourse of yours. You have given me the secret knowledge. Bhavapyayohibhutanam srutao vistarsomaya totta Kamal patraksa mahatmya API cha vyayam. And I have also heard the origin and destruction of beings, O lotusaid Krishna from you and also your inexhaustible greatness. I heard the greatness of the self, the supreme Brahman, that which is not limited by anything.\n\nAnd therefore my delusion is gone. I understand it clearly now. Evam etat yatha attha tvam atmanam parameshwara jastumi chami the rupam aishwaram purushottamam. However, I would like to see. Form as you described yourself of that oneness in this world of plurality. I have understood that you pervade the entire universe and therefore there is no existence separate from you.\n\nHowever, at this time I cannot see that. And I would like to see that. I would like to experience that oneness of yours. Manyase yaditatsakyam maya drastum ITI prabhav. If you think it is possible for me to see that divine form, then, O Lord of Yogas, show me you are that imperishable form which includes everything in this world. I would like to see that complete form of yours where everything is in yourself.\n\nIt is easier for me to see your presence in this world of plurality. As Swamiji explains that it is easier for me to see gold in gold jewelry. I can take one look at it, experience it, the gold in it, I can pick up the another one as long as it is the excellence. In other words, the gold is apparent. It's not covered by something. The gold is manifested in the jewelry.\n\nI can see the gold in it. So it is easier to see the divinity in the world of plurality for us. What is not possible for us generally is seeing all the plurality in that one single entity. I can imagine that God is in you. God is in me, God is in He, God is in she. If my mind and intellect has achieved that level of purity, level of understanding, then I start seeing the divinity in all beings.\n\nAnd therefore, in our culture, when we meet each other, we say, namaste, Namah te, I bow down to you. I'm not bowing down to the limited self which is standing in front of me. Because I may have my own opinion about that person, but I still do. Namaste to all of the people I meet, at least culturally. That's what we should be doing or we are doing. Who we are bowing down to is the divinity in that person that I recognize.\n\nThe divinity in me and divinity in you is the same. So I respect the divinity in you. I bow down to you with that recognition. My transaction with you would be always of very friendly, very congenial, and not adversarial. Because I have recognized that myself and yourself has one thing in common, that consciousness, the divinity which makes me who I am. The same divinity, the same consciousness is within you.\n\nWhat I have trouble imagining or trouble perceiving or trouble seeing is the whole divinity is one. And you and I in them. And we have heard in Bhagavad Gita before, Bhagavan says, I am not in them, they are in me. The car is in the space, the space is not in the car. When I see a car which was built in Germany, there was space inside. When it was in Germany, there was German space.\n\nAnd they seal it tight and then transport that car to United States. Now the car is here, the space is still intact which was sealed in Germany. Now, whether the space now in the United States is the German space or American space in the car, obviously the answer is simple. The space inside the car is American space. So what happened to the German space which was in the car when it was still tight in Germany? The answer obviously is in our way of seeing space.\n\nAs long as I see the space in the car, I have difficulty imagining what happening to that space which was German space. When it came to America, the space was inside the car. Car was never opened till it came here. Well, it should have been a German space in it. But if I start seeing that the space was not in the car, the car was in the space, then I do not have any difficulty. Car was traveling in the space.\n\nAnd therefore wherever the car is, that country space is in that car, because car is traveling in the space. For me to imagine that, I have to first have a perception of a space as a totality without any gap. A German space is one space, an American space is another space, I will have difficulty. But if I can imagine a homogeneous, continuous, universal space, now I can see everything is in it. So what you and I have difficulty in recognizing the unity between myself and yourself and herself, and also the objects in this room is because of the distance between us. I am here and you are there, you are there and she is somewhere else.\n\nWhat is separating us from each other is the space. What is separating me from my father is the time. My father lived up to 1975 and I'm here today in 2014 thinking about it. So we are separated from each other by time. So there are two things which creates this world of plurality for me, and that is space and time. We have also heard from sages and scientists that this concept of space and this concept of time is creation of my mind.\n\nSo one can say, well, what is the distance between here to D.C. and so on. So it's too long a journey. And somebody will say it's too close, it's only two hour drive. So my mind creates the valuation whether it's too far or too little, that the conception of space in my mind, same thing. If somebody says I'll be back in half an hour, well, is it too soon for me or too long for me? I can't wait for half an hour.\n\nYou need to be back here in 10 minutes. Because my conception of time is different than his conception of time. For him half an hour is too short, and for me half an hour is too long. Well, anytime somebody goes to India for a vacation and when they come back, and if I ask that person, so how was your vacation? The answer is it was great, but it was too short. And I say, how long were you there?\n\nHe said four weeks for me, too long a time. I only go there for a week or two. So for me a two weeks vacation is good enough for them four weeks is too short, because when you are enjoying their four weeks seems too short. But if you were suffering because of the heat or monsoon and all the other things which we normally complain about, if I'm suffering. I'll say, boy, it was too long when I tried. And then I finally was ready to get out.\n\nSo even time is a concept of my mind. If these two concepts of my mind are wiped out, then I will see the world completely differently. If the concept of space is wiped out from my mind, then I will see you and I and everyone in this room come together as one entity. There is no space between us. We are all joined together and we will be one entity with different limbs, but we are all together. Swamiji uses a very good analogy in his commentary.\n\nThere is a toy maker making toys from clay. And he has various toys and various dolls. Elephant, tiger, baby and a bird. And then he decided, no, this is not good. I need to use this clay for something much larger, more sellable. He takes all those dolls and compresses them into one ball of clay.\n\nAnd when he compressed them together, what he has done is taken all the space away from each other. Previously they were sitting on a table or in a display box as separate entity. Once he gathers them and lumps them into one. And now a big lump of clay. At the same time, I can see the face of the elephant on that surface of that lump. Also see the baby smile.\n\nAlso see the tiger's face. What is taken away from each other is the space. The same way the events in my life has a time value of it was in my past, or it is in my present, or it will be in my future. My childhood is in my past. My youth is in my past. My old age is in my present.",
      "reflection": "Sit for a moment with the vastness of existence—billions of stars, billions of years, billions of beings. Let yourself feel small in the face of it all.\n\nThen remember: you are not separate from this vastness. You are the universe looking at itself. Both the terror and the wonder are appropriate responses to ultimate reality.\n\nThe cosmic vision shows that time devours all things. What would change if you held this truth constantly in awareness? Would petty concerns still trouble you? Would you use your time differently?"

I would like to see that complete form of yours where everything is in yourself.\n\nIt is easier for me to see your presence in this world of plurality.

If my mind and intellect has achieved that level of purity, level of understanding, then I start seeing the divinity in all beings.\n\nAnd therefore, in our culture, when we meet each other, we say, namaste, Namah te, I bow down to you. I'm not bowing down to the limited self which is standing in front of me. Because I may have my own opinion about that person, but I still do. Namaste to all of the people I meet, at least culturally. That's what we should be doing or we are doing. Who we are bowing down to is the divinity in that person that I recognize.\n\nThe divinity in me and divinity in you is the same. So I respect the divinity in you. I bow down to you with that recognition. My transaction with you would be always of very friendly, very congenial, and not adversarial. Because I have recognized that myself and yourself has one thing in common, that consciousness, the divinity which makes me who I am. The same divinity, the same consciousness is within you.\n\nWhat I have trouble imagining or trouble perceiving or trouble seeing is the whole divinity is one. And you and I in them. And we have heard in Bhagavad Gita before, Bhagavan says, I am not in them, they are in me. The car is in the space, the space is not in the car. When I see a car which was built in Germany, there was space inside. When it was in Germany, there was German space.\n\nAnd they seal it tight and then transport that car to United States. Now the car is here, the space is still intact which was sealed in Germany. Now, whether the space now in the United States is the German space or American space in the car, obviously the answer is simple. The space inside the car is American space. So what happened to the German space which was in the car when it was still tight in Germany? The answer obviously is in our way of seeing space.\n\nAs long as I see the space in the car, I have difficulty imagining what happening to that space which was German space. When it came to America, the space was inside the car. Car was never opened till it came here. Well, it should have been a German space in it. But if I start seeing that the space was not in the car, the car was in the space, then I do not have any difficulty. Car was traveling in the space.\n\nAnd therefore wherever the car is, that country space is in that car, because car is traveling in the space. For me to imagine that, I have to first have a perception of a space as a totality without any gap. A German space is one space, an American space is another space, I will have difficulty. But if I can imagine a homogeneous, continuous, universal space, now I can see everything is in it. So what you and I have difficulty in recognizing the unity between myself and yourself and herself, and also the objects in this room is because of the distance between us. I am here and you are there, you are there and she is somewhere else.\n\nWhat is separating us from each other is the space. What is separating me from my father is the time. My father lived up to 1975 and I'm here today in 2014 thinking about it. So we are separated from each other by time. So there are two things which creates this world of plurality for me, and that is space and time. We have also heard from sages and scientists that this concept of space and this concept of time is creation of my mind.\n\nSo one can say, well, what is the distance between here to D.C. and so on. So it's too long a journey. And somebody will say it's too close, it's only two hour drive. So my mind creates the valuation whether it's too far or too little, that the conception of space in my mind, same thing. If somebody says I'll be back in half an hour, well, is it too soon for me or too long for me? I can't wait for half an hour.\n\nYou need to be back here in 10 minutes. Because my conception of time is different than his conception of time. For him half an hour is too short, and for me half an hour is too long. Well, anytime somebody goes to India for a vacation and when they come back, and if I ask that person, so how was your vacation? The answer is it was great, but it was too short. And I say, how long were you there?\n\nHe said four weeks for me, too long a time. I only go there for a week or two. So for me a two weeks vacation is good enough for them four weeks is too short, because when you are enjoying their four weeks seems too short. But if you were suffering because of the heat or monsoon and all the other things which we normally complain about, if I'm suffering. I'll say, boy, it was too long when I tried. And then I finally was ready to get out.\n\nSo even time is a concept of my mind. If these two concepts of my mind are wiped out, then I will see the world completely differently. If the concept of space is wiped out from my mind, then I will see you and I and everyone in this room come together as one entity. There is no space between us. We are all joined together and we will be one entity with different limbs, but we are all together. Swamiji uses a very good analogy in his commentary.\n\nThere is a toy maker making toys from clay. And he has various toys and various dolls. Elephant, tiger, baby and a bird. And then he decided, no, this is not good. I need to use this clay for something much larger, more sellable. He takes all those dolls and compresses them into one ball of clay.\n\nAnd when he compressed them together, what he has done is taken all the space away from each other. Previously they were sitting on a table or in a display box as separate entity. Once he gathers them and lumps them into one. And now a big lump of clay. At the same time, I can see the face of the elephant on that surface of that lump. Also see the baby smile.\n\nAlso see the tiger's face. What is taken away from each other is the space. The same way the events in my life has a time value of it was in my past, or it is in my present, or it will be in my future. My childhood is in my past. My youth is in my past. My old age is in my present.",
      "reflection": "Sit for a moment with the vastness of existence—billions of stars, billions of years, billions of beings. Let yourself feel small in the face of it all.\n\nThen remember: you are not separate from this vastness. You are the universe looking at itself. Both the terror and the wonder are appropriate responses to ultimate reality.\n\nThe cosmic vision shows that time devours all things. What would change if you held this truth constantly in awareness? Would petty concerns still trouble you? Would you use your time differently?"

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 11. Viswarupadarshan yoga, cosmic Form. You all want to know Bhagavan. Bhagavan, if I show you my Roop, it may not be that pleasant as you think. So Arjuna asked for it and he got what he wished for. Both concepts of space and time are wiped out from his mind.\n\nNow he sees this entire Jagat without any space. Also he's seeing it without any time difference. So first he described what he saw and said, I see that everything is within you. I see with many mouths, many hands, many stomachs, many legs. In other words, all the legs and all the mouths which I consider to be individually assigned to individual are all yours. I see them all into you.\n\nHe also saw everything that he has ever encountered in his life. Devas, all the deities, I see all of them into you. So he described what he sees. Then he also sees how what is the condition of other beings just looking at this great form that all these people are entering into you. Some are fearful and some are praising your glory. Some who are not comprehended the reality, they are fearful of the reality.\n\nWhen we are not sure about what is the outcome of my actions in my life, we are fearful of it. Those who are wise enough to not get perturbed by whatever the outcome is, they are blissful and praising the Lord because they have accepted everything. So you see those wise people are praising you, but others are entering into you. They are afraid of you. And then he says, I also see you as Vishnu. I see you as that Almighty Vishnu.\n\nKiritinam Gadinam, Chakri Namcha. With all your attributes, I see you. But then he says, I also don't see any middle, end or beginning. And all the space between the heavens and earth is filled with you alone. Up till now what I consider nothingness, there is no nothing called nothingness anymore. It's everything is you and you alone.\n\nSo I see you all around me and everything in you. And now I also see how the world is Looking at you, how the other beings. He still keeps himself out of this. He is an observer observing an object. His experience is all objective. Right now he is describing what's happening to others.\n\nThis is how we observe our world. We keep ourselves out of it and then say, oh, he is not doing exercise, he is going to be suffering, he is smoking, he is going to have cancer. We keep ourselves out of it. We look at the world and see how they are doing and how they are feeling and how they are behaving. So up to now he is looking at everything and saying, everybody is entering into you. Some are fearful, some are praising you.\n\nI see the deities, I see everything into. You are filling all the spaces. But then he starts having the other side of the experience. It's not all wonderful life. When we say it's not all wonderful life has its positive moments and negative moments. And when you focus on one, you can always give a biography of a person of how great he was and how accomplished he was.\n\nEvery funeral I go to, I realize that there is not an average person in this world. Everyone says how great the person was and what he accomplished and how loving he was. I have never heard somebody saying that he was such an average person. He didn't really accomplish much in his life. He was a terrible husband, cruel father. Because we focus on what is good in that person, so we highlight all the goodness in him.\n\nSo up till now Arjuna was only focusing on the divinity. Then he sees Brahma seated on the lotus. All the deities are praising, all the vasavas and maruts and everybody is praising. And they are all dumbfounded just looking at this great. They're looking in wonderment. Even the wise person also gets awed by the nature.\n\nEven people like Einstein, who are pure scientists, he could not figure out what the God's game is all about. That's why the God doesn't play dice. He has complete faith that he wouldn't be doing something. He had faith in God's laws of nature that I can figure them out. This world is very predictable from our perspective, there's nothing unpredictable in this world. Really with that, so we can plan our life.\n\nI'll get up at 6 o' clock and then I'll do this. Then I'll be at a class at 10 o'. We can plan that because it's predictable. Everything you can predict when I leave my house. Unpredictable part is what will happen during that period. And once we look at that, we start getting fearful.\n\nWell, you can get an accident. You are at a Times Square walking around and somebody just drives car on the sidewalk. It's unthinkable, Unpredictable. Unpredictable things do occur. So there is positive and there is negative. From our perspective, from our relative world there is positive and negative.\n\nNow Arjuna from his perspective says what is also not so pleasant. So he says Nabhas prasam Diptam Manek Varnam Vyattananam Dipta Vishala Netram drastva Hitvam pravatitan amtaratnam Drutimna Vrindami Shammcha Vishnu Having seen your form touching the sky inflaming with many colors that your open mouth and the fiery eyes I am shaken up inside me. I am not having courage, not having any peace. Up till now I had place in this world where I have staked myself and said this is where I am and this is in relationship to the world who I am. The moment I feel insignificant in anywhere in my organization, in my society, in my community, in my family, I start getting depressed. We keep our balance by having that self assessment of ourselves, an important being.\n\nThe moment we drop that we are completely fearful. We do not know where we stand. That's why people retire after they lose their sense of what is important. This guy Roger Ailes he ruled Fox channel for a long time. As soon as they disgraced and ousted died within a year. Had he been still at Fox he probably would have been still doing that for next 10 years.\n\nPeople lose their bearing in life and therefore they lose their stability. So he said Dryim na vindami samamcha Vishnu I do not see what I can do. I don't think I'm capable of anything and I have no peace because of that. Danstra Karalani Chate Mukhane now he gives the other side of the coin. Up till now he was talking about all existence. That he's seeing everything existing in you.\n\nI see that everything is existing in you and everything is supported by you. But now he says Dhanstra Karalani Chate Mukhani Drastva Eva Kala Anala Sanni Bhani that I see in your mouth these terrible teeth, fearsome teeth and this fire blazing in your mouth. Dissona Jana I don't see the directions, direction, my place in life I do not see, I do not see my place in this universe. Up till now I had a complete sense of who I am and where I am. My placement in life I know who I am. In my family there is a placement.\n\nI know who I am in my community I Know who I am in my company. I know who I am as a citizen. There is a bearing where I can describe. I'm at L1537B Knuckles Road. I can tell you how to come to me. There is a complete sense of placement and direction.\n\nI am such and such in the community. So I had a complete sense of my worth and my place in this universe. But once I see the mortality that everything is rushing towards you and so am I. So right now I see my life in a static picture. I always see myself as existing now. So it's a static picture in my head.\n\nEverybody else see me getting old. It's very hard for you to imagine yourself to be growing and deteriorating. You're able to constantly remind yourself, you know, I can't do that anymore. I have to keep telling myself, I'm an old man. Because I don't see myself as old man. I have to remind myself.\n\nThe other day I was reading something. Some psycho analyst says that the difference between a normal person and a psychopath was a psychopath or somebody has to remind that this is not an acceptable behavior. Other person can normally know what is an acceptable behavior in a society. Person is suffering from that mental disease who becomes a sociopath or psychopath. He does not have that bearing. Somebody has to constantly tell him this is not acceptable, this is not acceptable.\n\nThen only he can function in the society. So he said, having seen this mortality, that everything is rushing towards you. And there's the terrible teeth, the blazing fire in your mouth. You are the resting place and everything. The all names and forms, including mine, will be destroyed in your. Therefore, I do not know what is my place in life.\n\nI am fast forwarding my life right now. I am seeing my life in one frame at a time. Therefore it is a static picture I am seeing. I am seeing every moment. I am seeing one frame at a time. I have forgotten the last frame.\n\nI also don't know the next frame when I look at it. It's a static picture and I consider that as my existence. Fast forward my life. We have DVR obviously, though we record all the shows. Sometimes I say, Meena, you have 24 of this sat Nirvana Satya. So when are we going to get rid of.\n\nOh, no, no, I'll finish. I'll do speed watching. I had heard speed reading Speed watching fast forward for three minutes. The whole show is on. So that person comes his whole, whole episode in two minutes is over. If our life is Fast forward the eulogy at the end of your life.\n\nSomebody will give you in two minutes. He was born in Surat, went to high school here, Then I went to architecture school, went to Africa, then taught Bhagavad Gita and died. Entire life summarized in two minutes or less than that. When you fast for your life, the only thing you see is I am rushing towards my death. That's all I'm doing every moment. And we have to keep reminding also to have birthday celebration to say this is not bad so far.\n\nSo he said, I do not know. Dhisona Jane la ve na cha Sharmaha. Having seen my mortality and insignificantness, I can't find any peace. What is the purpose of my life? But we completely realized that all I consider to be my abilities my is of no value 0 when you are sick. And I have explained myself when you are sick, you tell me anything about.\n\nI'm not listening right now. I just can't feel good about. You know, I have fever 105 and you want to talk to me about Bhagavad Gita. Forget about it right now. I can't find any bearing. At that time Arjuna said, I'm in that situation, I can't find it.\n\nSo he said, prasida devesa Jagat ni vasaha. This is Swamiji says, the true surrender surrender. Intellectually I am Bhagawan tera tuzuko or Pon kya lagi mehra. Intellectually surrender means really nothing. Because you still think I am surrendering. That ego is still there very much there.\n\nI am good, I am doing puja, I am doing meditation. I am that I is so solid there that the surrender is of not much value.",
      "reflection": "Sit for a moment with the vastness of existence—billions of stars, billions of years, billions of beings. Let yourself feel small in the face of it all.\n\nThen remember: you are not separate from this vastness. You are the universe looking at itself. Both the terror and the wonder are appropriate responses to ultimate reality.\n\nThe cosmic vision shows that time devours all things. What would change if you held this truth constantly in awareness? Would petty concerns still trouble you? Would you use your time differently?"

      "commentary": "We have completed chapter 10, _Verses_ Yoga, and we'll be now discussing chapter 11, Vishwarupadarshan, the cosmic form of the Divine. So in last chapter, Arjuna had asked Krishna that tell me how I should feel your presence, the presence of the divine, presence of that all pervading self, then how I can meditate upon that. And in response to that, Bhagavan has given him the various examples of excellence in this world from various walks of life for Arjuna, which is also applicable to us, that from our day to day life, from our cultural backgrounds, from our spiritual quest, that we find examples all around us of excellence and feel Lord's presence. As we have discussed in chapter 10, that anytime I see excellence, my mind thinks it is the God's blessings, the grace of God, in other words, the divinity is evident in excellence. So Bhagavan has given various examples for Arjuna and say, when you see this, it will remind you of my presence in all things and beings. I'm not limited to those excellent manifestations, but that's where you will find it easier to experience my presence.\n\nAnd now that Arjuna has heard that, he says that I'm not still experiencing that oneness, that oneness which you talk about all throughout this discourse. I have intellectually appreciated and I've come to the conclusion that that's what it is, that there is a one singular entity pervading this entire universe, which is you, the Supreme Self. But I need to have that experience. I would like to experience that oneness. This is something, as Swamiji explains, is similar to how we scientifically make any concept or a theory knowledge of our own. First I need to gather all the evidences and data.\n\nAnd then once I have gathered all the data, all the evidences, that now I have to demonstrate that that phenomenon exists. I gather all information about how the water is formed. In chemistry classes, two molecules of hydrogen, one molecule of oxygen can create water. But at some point I want to see the demonstration so that in the lab I create that situation and Then see the demonstration how the hydrogen oxygen can create water in a similar fashion. Arjuna has now understood, but he wants to see a demonstration. So the chapter starts with Arjuna Vacha.\n\nArjuna said mat anugraha yaparamam guhyam adhyatma Sangnitam yat tvaya uktam vachasthena Moho ayam vigatomama. With your compassion for me, you have given me this secret knowledge. And as you have said, the that the self is indestructible, imperishable, one who consider himself to be the slayer or the slain in both cases is wrong. There is nothing to grieve over the changes which takes place in this world, including death. Because death is not the end of existence. It is only the existence in the form of this body.\n\nSo moho yam vigato Mama. By this discourse of yours. You have given me the secret knowledge. Bhavapyayohibhutanam srutao vistarsomaya totta Kamal patraksa mahatmya API cha vyayam. And I have also heard the origin and destruction of beings, O lotusaid Krishna from you and also your inexhaustible greatness. I heard the greatness of the self, the supreme Brahman, that which is not limited by anything.\n\nAnd therefore my delusion is gone. I understand it clearly now. Evam etat yatha attha tvam atmanam parameshwara jastumi chami the rupam aishwaram purushottamam. However, I would like to see. Form as you described yourself of that oneness in this world of plurality. I have understood that you pervade the entire universe and therefore there is no existence separate from you.\n\nHowever, at this time I cannot see that. And I would like to see that. I would like to experience that oneness of yours. Manyase yaditatsakyam maya drastum ITI prabhav. If you think it is possible for me to see that divine form, then, O Lord of Yogas, show me you are that imperishable form which includes everything in this world. I would like to see that complete form of yours where everything is in yourself.\n\nIt is easier for me to see your presence in this world of plurality. As Swamiji explains that it is easier for me to see gold in gold jewelry. I can take one look at it, experience it, the gold in it, I can pick up the another one as long as it is the excellence. In other words, the gold is apparent. It's not covered by something. The gold is manifested in the jewelry.\n\nI can see the gold in it. So it is easier to see the divinity in the world of plurality for us. What is not possible for us generally is seeing all the plurality in that one single entity. I can imagine that God is in you. God is in me, God is in He, God is in she. If my mind and intellect has achieved that level of purity, level of understanding, then I start seeing the divinity in all beings.\n\nAnd therefore, in our culture, when we meet each other, we say, namaste, Namah te, I bow down to you. I'm not bowing down to the limited self which is standing in front of me. Because I may have my own opinion about that person, but I still do. Namaste to all of the people I meet, at least culturally. That's what we should be doing or we are doing. Who we are bowing down to is the divinity in that person that I recognize.\n\nThe divinity in me and divinity in you is the same. So I respect the divinity in you. I bow down to you with that recognition. My transaction with you would be always of very friendly, very congenial, and not adversarial. Because I have recognized that myself and yourself has one thing in common, that consciousness, the divinity which makes me who I am. The same divinity, the same consciousness is within you.\n\nWhat I have trouble imagining or trouble perceiving or trouble seeing is the whole divinity is one. And you and I in them. And we have heard in Bhagavad Gita before, Bhagavan says, I am not in them, they are in me. The car is in the space, the space is not in the car. When I see a car which was built in Germany, there was space inside. When it was in Germany, there was German space.\n\nAnd they seal it tight and then transport that car to United States. Now the car is here, the space is still intact which was sealed in Germany. Now, whether the space now in the United States is the German space or American space in the car, obviously the answer is simple. The space inside the car is American space. So what happened to the German space which was in the car when it was still tight in Germany? The answer obviously is in our way of seeing space.\n\nAs long as I see the space in the car, I have difficulty imagining what happening to that space which was German space. When it came to America, the space was inside the car. Car was never opened till it came here. Well, it should have been a German space in it. But if I start seeing that the space was not in the car, the car was in the space, then I do not have any difficulty. Car was traveling in the space.\n\nAnd therefore wherever the car is, that country space is in that car, because car is traveling in the space. For me to imagine that, I have to first have a perception of a space as a totality without any gap. A German space is one space, an American space is another space, I will have difficulty. But if I can imagine a homogeneous, continuous, universal space, now I can see everything is in it. So what you and I have difficulty in recognizing the unity between myself and yourself and herself, and also the objects in this room is because of the distance between us. I am here and you are there, you are there and she is somewhere else.\n\nWhat is separating us from each other is the space. What is separating me from my father is the time. My father lived up to 1975 and I'm here today in 2014 thinking about it. So we are separated from each other by time. So there are two things which creates this world of plurality for me, and that is space and time. We have also heard from sages and scientists that this concept of space and this concept of time is creation of my mind.\n\nSo one can say, well, what is the distance between here to D.C. and so on. So it's too long a journey. And somebody will say it's too close, it's only two hour drive. So my mind creates the valuation whether it's too far or too little, that the conception of space in my mind, same thing. If somebody says I'll be back in half an hour, well, is it too soon for me or too long for me? I can't wait for half an hour.\n\nYou need to be back here in 10 minutes. Because my conception of time is different than his conception of time. For him half an hour is too short, and for me half an hour is too long. Well, anytime somebody goes to India for a vacation and when they come back, and if I ask that person, so how was your vacation? The answer is it was great, but it was too short. And I say, how long were you there?\n\nHe said four weeks for me, too long a time. I only go there for a week or two. So for me a two weeks vacation is good enough for them four weeks is too short, because when you are enjoying their four weeks seems too short. But if you were suffering because of the heat or monsoon and all the other things which we normally complain about, if I'm suffering. I'll say, boy, it was too long when I tried. And then I finally was ready to get out.\n\nSo even time is a concept of my mind. If these two concepts of my mind are wiped out, then I will see the world completely differently. If the concept of space is wiped out from my mind, then I will see you and I and everyone in this room come together as one entity. There is no space between us. We are all joined together and we will be one entity with different limbs, but we are all together. Swamiji uses a very good analogy in his commentary.\n\nThere is a toy maker making toys from clay. And he has various toys and various dolls. Elephant, tiger, baby and a bird. And then he decided, no, this is not good. I need to use this clay for something much larger, more sellable. He takes all those dolls and compresses them into one ball of clay.\n\nAnd when he compressed them together, what he has done is taken all the space away from each other. Previously they were sitting on a table or in a display box as separate entity. Once he gathers them and lumps them into one. And now a big lump of clay. At the same time, I can see the face of the elephant on that surface of that lump. Also see the baby smile.\n\nAlso see the tiger's face. What is taken away from each other is the space. The same way the events in my life has a time value of it was in my past, or it is in my present, or it will be in my future. My childhood is in my past. My youth is in my past. My old age is in my present.",

      "commentary": "What is my purpose and destiny? We had been discussing chapter 11 in October 30th. We have seen Arjuna's description of what he is saying and we have discussed so many times in last few weeks. What he has seen is everything that he can perceive in this world, all coming together as one, this plurality which is separated from each other. Now he sees that as one singularity. He also sees all the divine beings which he has just heard of in his Vedic training or from the cultural training.\n\nHe see all of them, the Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh, all of them into this one entity. But he also sees that all these beings are rushing towards the mouth of that supreme being and getting dissolved into that getting, disappearing into it. And he comes to this realization that just as the river water is rushing towards the ocean, it like intuitively with inherent nature, not that somebody is propelling it, somebody forcing it by its inherent nature. The river water runs from the mountaintops through the plains to the ocean. Just as the moth instinctively rush towards its death into the flame, river rushes towards the ocean, loses its identity. Mighty river, like Ganges or Yamuna or even Patomak or James, once it disappears into the ocean, there is no identity of the river of its own.\n\nIt just becomes part of the ocean. It seemed that the true nature of the river and the moth. So he sees that all the beings are without any hesitation, they're rushing towards the mouth of this great being and disappearing into it. And then he sees that this great being is seemingly enjoying this act of all these beings disappearing into his mouth, some get stuck. He makes sure that nobody is left out when we do some task. And we are so happy about it, that we are so proud of that.\n\nIn the end we try to inspect and say, is there anything left? That's basically equivalent to licking what's going into his mouth. See, make sure that all these beings are getting dissolved into his own being. And now Arjuna says, I don't understand any of this. Akyahi me ko bhavan ugrarupaha. Tell me O being with a very fierce form Namostu te deva or prasida if you want to ask somebody who are you and that person is not smaller than you are, you better be a little respectful first.\n\nIt does ask and say I want to know who you are. But Namostute devara prasida, you are the supreme Lord. So I bow down to you and have mercy on me because I don't understand. I am not capable of understanding who you are and vignatum ichami bhavantam adyam I have completely and clearly recognized that you are the Adi being. You are the original being. All beings are nothing but the manifestation of you.\n\nThey come from you, they go into you. But you are that original Bhavantam adyam. You are that original being. Vigna dummy Charming. I want to know which is in normal terms we say I want to know God. I know he is the supreme being.\n\nAt least from my childhood religious training I understood that he controlled this world. Vigna tam ichami bhavanta madhyam Even after having this global vision, the cosmic vision our intellect is not capable of understanding it. Nahi prajanami tavapravratyam Also I have no idea why you are doing this activity which I see right now. Isn't that something we ask all the time? I don't know why Bhagawan does this thing, why there is tsunami, why there is earthquake or why Bill Gates and Steve Jobs is successful and not every IT person in this country. I do not know what you are doing Bhagwan.\n\nI hope you know what you are doing. Basically Arjuna puts it in his word very respectfully saying I want to know you O supreme Being. I clearly recognize you are the original being But I also don't understand what you are engaged into right now I see all this being going into your mouth and getting crushed. He has also seen we have seen that all Kauravas are going to into his mouth as well as all the great kings on both sides. See anytime we have a reason, we have a reason which is something closer to our own situation. Anytime you have a dream, dream is always something related to what I was thinking about last probably a week or so.\n\nSo even when he sees this whole cosmic reason he focuses on all these Kauravas are going into his mouth. All the kings from the Kauravas as well as the kings from our side going into his mouth they said I don't understand what are you engaged into it right now. And in response to that the Bhagavan Said Kalav asmi. I am time Lokaksha, Kruta Pravrad daha. I am engaged in destroying this world. I can see the world from both perspectives.\n\nEither I can see it from a constructive perspective or a destructive perspective in nature. Actually both simultaneously keeps going on. Something gets destroyed, something gets built. I can fix my perspective only on the destruction part and say why this thing is happening. I can look at the statistics in the newspaper and say how many people die every day and say oh God, billions of people die. I don't know whether millions or billions, but I'm sure there are plenty because every several seconds there's somebody dies in the United States.\n\nI read somewhere if I look and say God, why do you do this? This many people dying every day. Don't you have better things to do than just killing? Right now Arjuna is just seeing this destruction going on. So Bhagavan's answer is also exactly that. Kalaha Asmi, I am all devouring time.\n\nI was born in 1948, in 2012. I'm an old man, but sometimes in 2000 something I won't be around. Lokakshaya krita pravadha. You're seeing me destroying this world. As you know, the world as I know right now, is actually rushing towards its own destruction. All my friends and relatives and all of them, one after the other, they're all rushing towards their own death.\n\nKalavasmi lokaksha Kruta Prabhradha. From your perspective, Arjuna, I am that all devouring time. Right now what you are seeing is I am engaged in destroying these worlds. Lokan sama hartum iha pravrutaha ruteapi tvamna Bhavishyanti swarve e avasthitaha pratyanikeshi odaha. Even without you now coming down very personally to Arjuna, Arjuna said, I don't want to engage in this war. The whole purpose of this divine vision Arjuna wanted to have was all this philosophy you have given me in the argument in the second chapter in the beginning that why I should engage in this war because Bhagavan said, look, whoever takes birth will die.\n\nBeginning they unmanifest, they will manifest for a while, they will unmanifest in the end. So you don't worry about it. Whatever the little role you are given in this drama, you take part and take credit for it and you don't worry about who's going to die and who's going to survive. But Arjuna was not clear. So he said, well let me see this entire vision now. He sees the entire vision and then he says I don't understand what are you doing?\n\nAnd Bhagawan basically said, don't worry about it, I am time. I'm going to destroy everything in time. Whether you take part in it or not. Even without you, none of the warriors in front of you shall live. Whether you take part in this war or not is immaterial. Their destiny is to die in time.\n\nWhenever their time will come, they will die. Because I am that all devouring time. Tasmat Utestha Yashola Basva all you have to do is take credit for it. Everybody says Bill Clinton was the best president in his time. We all thrived and our country has this surplus we never had seen in all these times before. And George Bush came and completely messed it all up.\n\nBut I'll tell you what, if George Bush was the president at the time when the technology bubble was blowing up, he would have the same credit. He just happened to be at that time a president. And we can blame Obama all we want. About 8% or 9% unemployment. But even if Bill Clinton is today, he would have the same problem. Because this thing is driven by this cycle, cosmic cycle, economic cycles, whatever the cycle you want to call it, you just happen to be there.\n\nAnd if you're a smart person, you do your part and take credit. Become that instrument in this giant will of Dharma. So therefore Bhagavan said, look, all these people are already killed by me. Without your help also they will get killed. You just saw that every being is rushing towards their death in my mouth. Get up Yashola Basra and get the fame that you deserve.\n\nJitva Satrun Bhangshvarajam Samruddham get victory over your enemies and enjoy the kingdom. Maya Evey Thai Nihitaha Purva Meva. I have already killed all these people before you decided to start this war. Nimittamatram Bhava Savya Sachin. So you just become the Nimitta Matra. If somebody gives you credit and say why don't you become our group's leader and do this petition to such and such.\n\nIt's not that the guy who is making a petition is the only guy who came up with the idea or we are just giving him a credit. Look we can all go and talk. You become our leader. Arjuna, I'm just giving you this opportunity. To become the Nimitt Matra because you deserve it. We always choose a person who has the best capabilities or the best qualification to become the representative of our group.\n\nWe try to elect the best person who could be our president by looking at his qualifications. So becoming a Nimitta mantra is also is something to be very proud of. That somebody has given us a chance considering us to be worthy of it. So when Bhagavan said, you become Nimitta Matra for something, you should take great pride in it and get up and do it. Swamiji says, in this case it Arjuna. But in our case also we get this chance all the time.\n\nBhagavan gives us the ability, capability and opportunity to do something in at our level in this world. And Bhagavan saying the same thing, look, I have already done this thing. It will be done whether you take part in it or not. But you have this opportunity. Why don't you take this chant and become Nimitta Matra? Become the instrument in my hand and take the credit and enjoy the credit.\n\nBhagavan said to Arjuna, same thing. These people are killed. You just do your part. You had been trained for these wars, tend up for the right cause. Take your credit and enjoy the fruits. Dronam Chabism Cha Jayadratham cha Karnam Tatha Anyanabi Yodavira Maya Hatam Stumhi Jahimam Vyatista.\n\nNobody gives us this kind of, you know, guarantees before we start anything. Neil, go and do this. You are going to win it. Don't worry about it. I already taken care of it. Once in a while somebody does it for us too.\n\nOur father comes to him and says beta, don't worry about it. I already talked to him. They are going to hire you, Right? So Bhagavan said, look, you are worried about the few of them. Whether you admit it or not that I can fight all this battle. But how can I fight in front of this great warriors such as Drona, Bisma, Jayadrata and Karna?\n\nBhagavan specifically mentions them and says I have already killed them.",
      "reflection": "Sit for a moment with the vastness of existence—billions of stars, billions of years, billions of beings. Let yourself feel small in the face of it all.\n\nThen remember: you are not separate from this vastness. You are the universe looking at itself. Both the terror and the wonder are appropriate responses to ultimate reality.\n\nThe cosmic vision shows that time devours all things. What would change if you held this truth constantly in awareness? Would petty concerns still trouble you? Would you use your time differently?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 11, Viswarupadarshan Yoga of the Cosmic form of the Lord. We have seen so far that Arjuna learned from Bhagavan first the nature of the limited self. What is the nature of this conditioned self? And learned that the self is immortal. The conditionings are perishable. Conditionings are this body, this mind, this intellect are perishable.\n\nBut the self is imperishable. And therefore, while working in this world, keep that self in mind, identify with that self. But that is not very naturally happening to people. So Bhagavan talked about how to act in this world, addressed Arjuna, that you should act in this world in the spirit of Yajna. You will be then gradually detach yourself from this ego and will be able to identify with yourself. So then obviously Arjuna wanted to know the nature of that imperishable self.\n\nSo from chapter seven, Bhagavan said that I am the source of all the beings and things. Aham krutnasya jagadah prabhavaha pralayah t. I am the source and dissolution of all things and beings in this world. So that's my relationship to you. I am the source of all the beings, and therefore also I am the source of you also. And then he says, matthaha parataram na asti kincit anyat asti dhananjaya. There is nothing higher than me.\n\nThere is nothing higher than this self. Therefore you should identify with the self. But Arjuna obviously was not ready to take this on its face value. The Bhagavan said, I am the source of all the beings and all the things. He wanted to know more. So he said, I want to know in detail your glories.\n\nBecause he is still identifying with Krishna as Krishna, him as Arjuna. And how can he be the Lord of all the beings? Arjuna identifying with his limited self, is speaking from his ego's perspective and projecting his world. Krishna speaking from his identification with the Supreme. He said, I am the source of all the beings so Arjuna said, explain to me in detail because I actually love hearing from your great glories all powers of this omnipresent omniscient being. So in chapter 10 we have detailed description of Bhagavan saying that you can see my glory in everything that is splendid, wonderful, strong, anything where you can find something which catches your eye.\n\nThat's me at the core of all beings. I am the sweetness in sugar, I am the light in sun, I am the liquidity in water. And even he says Dyutam, Chalaya, Tamasmi, even I am the gambling and the fraudulence. Even that also somebody can only cheat you if he is alive and conscious and consciousness is working through him. Everything that you see in this world, the core of all beings and things, is me and me alone. Nothing other than me exists.\n\nArjun heard all that, but he's still not satisfied. He's still not grasping the whole idea of the omnisciency and omnipotency of the Lord that how Lord can be everywhere. Say I want to see it. I have no doubt you said this and also many others have said before you. So I have no doubt about it. I take it for granted that what you are saying is correct.\n\nBecause time and again the sages after sages from the generations who come and confirm that this is the truth. So therefore I am not doubting it now. You, Krishna, telling me so, I have no doubt, but I want to say it. And therefore in chapter 11 we see that Krishna grants him this great vision of totality that you can see all at once. The past, present and future, an entire universe in your one glimpse, you can see it. And what he sees is that up till now the things which he has been seeing as different entities are all merged into one.\n\nThey're all _part of the one entity. Therefore he describes and says that I'm seeing that you have thousands of mouths and thousands of hands and thousands of legs and thousands of stomachs. Because every stomach is yours, every hand is yours, every mouth is yours. So I see now all of them as _part of the one entity. I'm seeing the wonderful sights and I'm seeing all these forms and colors and all the deities, the things which I have not seen before, I have not even imagined before. I'm seeing all of them.\n\nSo he's enchanted by that form. But then he sees the other side of it. Other side of creation is always destruction. This is the other side of it. He sees that now all those beings which I see existing in him also rushing towards his mouth to get destroyed. Every name and form in this world is helplessly rushing toward its own destruction within the self which is supporting it.\n\nSo he starts getting really nervous about it that everyone is rushing towards your mouth to get destroyed. And I see the great people, the great heroes are helplessly rushing towards your mouth and getting destroyed. And that reason really terrified him. We had this notion about Bhagavan as one who is compassionate. He is serene and he is creative. But the destructive aspect, we never focus on Arjuna while listening to all the discourses before all the glories, all the splendid descriptions given.\n\nI am the light in the sun. I am the fragrance in flower. So he was expecting it will be all well and good. Once I see the totality, it will be wonderful. My mind will be at peace. And after that there will be no problem.\n\nBut he sees the other side of it. He says everything is getting destroyed. Every name and form is getting destroyed in the being of that great Mahatma, the great person, the Purusha, the one entity. So he says, I'm terrified. I can't find my place in life. I don't know where I am and I'm losing my bearing.\n\nSo tell me, who are you and what are you up to? Because I have never imagined your form like this. See, only in our culture, in our religion, we have terrible forms of God also. Kali and Shiva, doing Tanda and Rythya and Pralaya. But most cases we want to see him as very calm and serene and very peaceful God. But when you want to understand God in totality Bhagavan said, you have to know this also.\n\nSo he sees this destruction happening. Bhagavan says, I am the world devouring time. Kalaha asked me that I am that time which devours everything. Within the time, all names and forms will be destroyed. Everything dissolves into time. Things exist in time, get destroyed by time.\n\nIt's I am that I am that all devouring time. What you are seeing me right now is my form which devours all names and forms. What are you up to right now? I'm engaged in destroying the world as you know. The world as you and I know is already getting destroyed by Bhagavan. Every second, every millisecond, it's constantly getting destroyed.\n\nMy reality yesterday is no longer my reality today. My reality today will no longer be my reality tomorrow. So it's constant, constantly destroying my world. And I am on the other end, constantly trying to keep my world in a status quo. I want to keep it exactly as I like. I think I'm right now in a better situation.\n\nLet's keep it that way. So we have a tug of war between the Bhagavan and I. I try to keep it. He wants to destroy it. So when I see him as all destroying powers of Bhagwan, why are you doing this? They say my purpose is. I am the time who devours everything.\n\nAnd right now you are seeing me destroying the world. As you know, and directly addressing. Arjuna said you were afraid that you will kill all these people. You thought that you are so powerful that you will kill all these people. Therefore you were afraid of taking _part in this war. They said, I have already killed them all.\n\nFrom our perspective, we are all alive and trying to survive. But Pagwan says there's time. I have already killed all of you for whatever time it is. You are going to be killed by time. No matter how many cryogenic Linux opens in Richmond. There is one opened, I guess, recently.\n\nThe time may be in years, maybe in millennials or years. But you will be destroyed by time. I've already destroyed you as the name and form you exist. I already killed you. Whether you take _part in this game or not. You think that you don't want to take _part in destroying these people?\n\nThese people already destroyed because we learned. I told you before, what will get destroyed is the conditioning. Only this self is immaculate, permanent, without any limitations. So these people are already destroyed as they exist. Is they Karna and a Bhishma and a Jayadratha. Even though they seem invincible from your perspective, and they have powers so much greater than you are.\n\nBut they are killed by me. So my advice to you, Arjuna, is take charge of your life. Do what you were trained to do. Do what you thought was the purpose of your life. To establish the rule of justice and punish the people who are evil doers. I have already killed them.\n\nYou take the credit and then enjoy this kingdom. And that's where Bhagavan stopped. And then Sanjaya now takes a chance to tell Dhritarashtra what's happening. Sanjaya Vacha etatshrutva vachanam KE sa vasya Krutanjalir vaipamanaha Kiriti namaskritva Bhuya evaha Krishnam Sagad Gyadam Bhite Bhitaha Pranamya. He's just giving him what's happening, a running commentary. And he said Having heard these words from Krishna.\n\nThat I already killed all of them. I am the one who devours everything. I am the one who kills. You just take the credit and enjoy the victory. Only you can take credit or enjoy victory if you take _part in it. If I don't take _part, there is no chance.\n\nThere is 100% chance of me losing if I don't buy a lottery ticket. Guaranteed 100% chance of not winning the lottery. That's at least the surest outcome I can say. But if I think I have a chance to win 1 in 10 million, I have to buy a lottery ticket. I have to take _part in it. The so Bhagawan said, I already decided who the winner is.\n\nYou go ahead and buy a lottery ticket if you think you can. But if you don't take _part, you will have no chance to win this thing. So Arjuna, therefore get up and do your duty. Result is decided by me. But you have a duty to perform your actions for which you are trained, which you thought is purpose of your life. And you must pursue that.\n\nHaving heard this, Sanjaya said that this Kiriti crowned one Gutanjali Rwpamanha, his folded palms trembling because he is still shaken up by this vision of all death and destruction happening constantly in this great self. The self remaining what it is, the names and forms are created in and getting destroyed all the time. Namaskritva having prostrating to him Bhuya Eva Aha Krishnam. He said the following words. He is choked with emotions, choked with the realization that what the self is all about. Up till now I was in control of my life.\n\nI thought I can control it. I have accomplished things. I have acquired abilities and promises. I suddenly realized that those things are of no value unless there is a support from the Almighty. The consciousness functioning through me. I may be the best architect, but if I'm in a coma, it doesn't do any good to anybody.",
      "reflection": "Sit for a moment with the vastness of existence—billions of stars, billions of years, billions of beings. Let yourself feel small in the face of it all.\n\nThen remember: you are not separate from this vastness. You are the universe looking at itself. Both the terror and the wonder are appropriate responses to ultimate reality.\n\nThe cosmic vision shows that time devours all things. What would change if you held this truth constantly in awareness? Would petty concerns still trouble you? Would you use your time differently?"

      "commentary": "As we have been discussing last few times, that now that Arjuna has seen this cosmic form of the Lord, in other words, his mind has comprehended the unity of this plurality, this world which seemingly is divided among this plurality of things and beings, is actually strung by the same entity which manifests as this plurality, beings and things come out of the same reality and dissolve into the same reality. That reality is what he's facing right now. So he's now offering his prayer, his adoration to that. And he has said, you are everything, Vayu Yama, Agni, Varuna, Anything that I can think of, any being my mind can perceive, is nothing, but you alone, all I see in you. And therefore he says, my salutations to you, my salutations to you thousand times I salute you from your front, I salute you in your back, I salute you in your side, because you are everywhere. Wherever I turn around, I see you.\n\nIf we come to the conclusion this world is nothing but the Lord's manifesto, so obviously when we turn around, we see him just as this classical. Maybe it's a folklore, but that Nanak went to Kaaba and he was sleeping with his feet towards Kaaba. And the Maulvi comes and says, you idiot, what are you doing? He said, oh, is that what I'm doing? Well, then move my leg to where the Kaaba is not the moulv in anger moves his leg. Wherever he turns, he sees Kaaba moving around with it.\n\nSo basically saying God is everywhere, because God is everything, therefore God is everywhere. So he said, therefore. Now, whatever I see when I say I bow down in the front, in the back and the rear, whatever I see in front of me, whatever I see in the side of me is nothing. But you and I recognize that in our culture we say, namaste, Namahte, I bow down to you, not you as a person, you the self, which is no other than myself. Once we found that commonality, we obviously can't have animosity or jealousy, for we just give lip service. Namaste, we Never understood.\n\nSo obviously we don't get the benefit of that. But if we develop any commonality with anybody somebody says, Sunil, which university did you go to? Oh, I'm also from Baroda. Then we start feeling comfortable right there. Then he says then which year you are? More we find we have more in common more we like each other more we fall in love with each other.\n\nIn other words, we find more identification with that person. So here now he is finding that everything that he knows is now him. So he is offering his salutation. Then he suddenly realizes that maybe when I was not aware of this fact that I may have insulted people. I may have insulted people who I should be actually respecting in this case. Obviously he superimposed all of that into Krishna Because Krishna is the one who showed me this Vishwaroop.\n\nSo he identifies that as the Krishna's self I am seeing. I Arjuna, seeing Krishna's self as this great cosmic being who is everywhere and everything. Therefore Hare Ram, Hare Krishna which is Swami Prabhupada movement they call it Krishna consciousness Lineage from Sankaracharya is the consciousness self consciousness. Myself and yourself is one and the same. Prabhupada comes from a different lineage which is a dualistic school of thought. They look at the Bhagavad Gita same way except a slight different twist and they will say the Krishna consciousness, my consciousness right now ego consciousness identify the Krishna consciousness.\n\nThen I become one with Krishna, the Krishna, not that historical Krishna but the universal being. So here Arjuna sees the same way as this is the Krishna's great cosmic form. I have known Krishna from my childhood as Devaki's son, Yasuda's son, my cousin but look at his greatness. Sakha, Ithimatva, Prasabham Yad Uktam. Not knowing your greatness I may have addressed you disrespectfully. This may not be appropriate for a great man like you.\n\nWhen I came to this country this is the biggest problem I had Here everybody called everybody first name. Obviously I was trained in India. And I said o', Neil, you can call. I say he's the president of our company of 200 people pharma. I am not going to call him David. No, no, it's okay, call him David.\n\nBut very difficult for us to do that boy, how can I say? Even today after living here for 30 years I have a client named Charles McFarlane and obviously we call him Charles. You know, he's about my age, so much younger than me. His father is 80 something and he used to be our senator Granger McFarlane. But he's also part of this project which I'm doing. So Charles will call my father.\n\nEverybody called him Granger. I said I'm not going to do that. I call him Mr. McFarlane and called Charles Charles. That's how I make distinction. When I call Charles, I call him Charles and I call his father Mr. McFarlane. So now Arjuna realizing he said I must have done not something right, I called you Saka.\n\nSo ajanata mahimanam avedam not that I want to disrespect you but I did not know your greatness that you are that all pervading being. See, till we want to see God, we are not one with him and therefore we are always say oh God, you are so almighty. We never say O my own self which is almighty. Because who is seeking this relief from pain and unhappiness? Actually the sufferer right now is none other than my ego. Something happens who gets hurt?\n\nSo who needs liberation? My ego can never be the God's self. So my ego says oh forgive me Lord. So here Arjuna says O forgive me. In not knowing your greatness I must have called you Saka Yadav Krishna whatever Maya pramadat pranayana maapi pramadat out of my lethargy in understanding you I could have realized what I'm realizing today had I given enough thought to it. But it never occurred to me that I should put enough effort to know you.\n\nSo pramada pranayana vapya Therefore I must have done this thing out of love for you. I liked you, I loved you. Just did not know your greatness. Therefore I could not give you the due respect which you deserve Just continuing that Yacha avaha sartham asat krutosi vihara sayya asana bhujanesho While we are together, roaming around, sleeping in the same room, eating dinner, whatever, eating things together I must have asatkrutosi things disrespectfully to you. Eko athwa API achyuta tat tamaksam tat kshamaye tvam aham aprameyam or when we are just alone and I must have done that. So he said any situation he's just enumerating what situation I must have done this or in a company or we were together with some other people.\n\nSometimes I say oh, it's okay that you insulted me because nobody was here. That's not good that you did that in front of my friend. Maybe I did it alone. But I may have done it even in front of other people. All of the tat shamaye. Please forgive me O Aapramayyam.\n\nBecause you are immeasurable. Basically when an individual recognizing the Lord's greatness in a sense we come to recognize that we are powerless in this world. And everything that we have achieved is because of his presence. Then all credits we have taken, the ego we have developed, all that we feel so bad about it that I must have done all of this, O Lord out of my own ignorance. But please forgive me. He said why he should forgive him.\n\nLet me tell you why you should forgive me. Because I know and I now recognize that you are Pitasi Lokasyachara Acharasya. You are the father of this entire Jagat made up of chara and Achara. That means everything. Then nothing you can leave behind in it. You are the most respectful, worshipable Guru Gariyan.\n\nYou are the greatest teacher of all. I did not know all this. You may take some blame for that. You are the greatest guru living with you also. I didn't learn all this thing. But you are the father of all the beingsamo Asti ABHI Adhikah.\n\nThere is no one greater than you. I now recognizing your almighty power. I thought he is powerful and he is powerful and she is powerful. And I was running after them. But I realized none When I divide this world into plurality again. You are because you are the powerhouse of everything.\n\nIn these three worlds. These three worlds can be defined in many different ways. One is obviously Swarga Lok Patal Lok in this Lok or a Swarga Nark and Prithvi Lok. But three Lokas generally in Vedanta. My three worlds are My waking world is my one world in which I have all these people who are more powerful than I am. And then I'm trying to gain their favor.\n\nI'm trying to be in their company. Anytime we see somebody president comes Here, everybody say Mr. President, very glad to see you sir. President, very glad to see you also. He moves on because there are 5,000 people in a day. Probably tells him that. We put picture in our office.\n\nNeil butt with Obama. Obama probably doesn't care. There are thousands of pictures like that. Pretty close relationship. We all have pictures with Swamiji. We were very close to Swamiji.\n\nWas Swamiji close to us? But that's our ego basically tells us to do. But this also our way of showing respect. There is none greater than you. So in my waking world I have thought there are many. But none has power of their own.\n\nThey all derive power from you. So you are the greatest of all in my waking world. Same is true for my dream world. I derive power in my dream world because I am conscious. I am self aware in my dream. And my own mind creates my own world.\n\nEven there, none greater than you. And when I'm in deep sleep, there is no one. I'm completely ignorant. In my deep sleep there is no thought. In deep sleep, you are the only one who takes care of me at the time. None greater than in these three worlds.\n\nIn the last verse we see Tasmad. Therefore Pranamya Pranidhaya Kayam. Therefore I bow down to with bending my body. Prasaday Tvam Hamishami Dyam Seeking your forgiveness, O adorable Lord. Now knowing your greatness, I adore you. We have learned what adoration is.\n\nIntensive form of love. Intensive love is intense identification. I am now bowing down to you with my body, with my mind and my intellectual Pita Evaputrashya Just as the father forgives his son, no matter what son does, once he says, dad, I'm sorry, that's the end of the story. No matter how bad it was. Okay my son, don't do it ever again. But I'm letting you go.\n\nAnd son knows that that trick works all the time. He said, because there's a love between the father and the son. No matter what it is, he forgives you. So you should do that. You are the father of the whole universe. That's another relationship where forgiveness comes very easy.\n\nYou and your friend are really mad at each other. And the other friend, you know, Neil, I'm so sorry I did that. That's the end of the story. Let's go see a movie together. It's a very different relationship. And then when you're in love, when somebody is beloved to you, no matter what differences you have.\n\nAnd you're mad at each other, as soon as one person.",

      "commentary": "So far we have discussed chapter 11. As we always try to remind ourselves, this chapter is all about cosmic form of the Lord. Cosmic form of the Lord means cosmic form of my own self, the self which I know since I became aware of myself as this me. When that paradigm shifts and I see that as all pervading self, that's the paradigm shift happened for Arjuna. We learn all this through the scriptures and religions and philosophy, that there is a unity in this diversity, but very hard to comprehend. And therefore we crave to have that experience of that unity.\n\nAnd Arjuna vocalizes our urge to see that unity to Krishna and said, I understand all that, but I want to experience it. I want to see that form of yours, O Supreme Lord, that I can understand all of that. And Bhagawan said, I'll show you. You won't be able to see it through your normal perception. The normal perception we have is I and the world exists. And therefore there is a duality.\n\nThere is a constant struggle between I and the world where I define myself as me and the world, everything else in the world, and then this world we divide into two, the world which I like and world which we don't like. So whole our life pursuit is to align with the world which I like and avoid the world which I don't like. Vedanta says, all over life, the pursuit is to avoid which is unpleasant and to gain what is pleasant. And this pursuit creates the friction, and that creates more unhappiness, more dissatisfaction, because almost everyone around me is trying to do the same thing. And then we are in competition to get out of that race. If I can get that vision of oneness, then I can have that everlasting peace that I am seeking.\n\nSo Bhagavan showed this roop to Arjuna. And Arjuna sees this world without any space and time. The dividing factor between I and the world is the space and time. And once that is taken off, I see this world as one entity ever strung into each other by a common thread. But this is an overwhelming picture for Arjunatua. So he said, I'm delighted to see this, but at the same time I am completely overwhelmed and I'm fearful.\n\nSo oh Lord, show me your form which is much gentler and which I am most comfortable with, which is that of Vishnu. We want to see Bhagavan in a form which is most comfortable to us, as we have discussed last time. So he says, show me with your form with the Kiritinam Gadinam, Chakrinam Hastam, with the crown and mace and Chakra which I'm so familiar with. Right from my childhood I've seen Vishnu's pictures and anytime somebody says, have you seen cosmic form? All of us say, oh yes, yeah, I've seen Bhagavad Gita pictures and you know, Shiva. Sure, because we have seen all the paintings of Shiva.\n\nSo we had a familiarity. We have formed an image of God in our head and any image other than that we are not comfortable with the whole understanding that this Almighty is nothing but the source of all these beings and there's all these beings is not really comforting thought. As the Lord, therefore very conveniently we divide the world which is good. Everything good happening is divine, bad happening is evil, Tsunami is evil, earthquake is evil. But in reality it's all part of the whole phenomena called this world. There's nothing evil or good about it.\n\nArjuna asked for that and then Bhagavan said in his response, Maya prasanne tava Arjuna, Idam Rupam Param Darsitam, Atma Yoga, last verse which you have seen. He said, I showed you the supreme form of mine graciously by me, because you are my devoted student, a friend and a devotee. With my Yoga, with my power of changing your perception, I have showed you my rope. Not that the roof was never unavailable. It is always available to those who can see it. Radio waves are always here for those who can tune into it.\n\nIt does not mean that we are not tuning into it. Form was always there. Arjuna did not have capacity to see it. But if my yoga gave you that perception which was Tejomayam Vishwam, Anantam, Yadyam, Yanmetva Anniyana, Drishta Purva, the splendid and all encompassing Vishwam, all pervading infinite form which you have seen and not seen by other before, then there are somebody saying that's not true. Krishna already showed it to Jashoda. This is not an argument about the Puranas saying, who saw it first?\n\nIt's the argument about no one in this state of mind, state of evolution, state of understanding has seen this thing. If I can say, well, I actually saw it while driving down to my work yesterday, well, that's not true, not going to happen. Because then I won't be able to drive because I miss that whole perception. The road in my car and me. I can't have these two together. Perception of me and this world and the me and the world is one and the same all at the same time.\n\nTherefore I say, nobody has seen it before you, you remaining you. Arjuna has seen this form. And then why this is not seen by others? Because others are trying to say this by the means which they find it most convenient and appropriate to them. We are also trying to find that source of happiness which has infinite power to make us happy. So we try our own way.\n\nWe say we will have the best education. We want our children to be the happiest in this world. What are we going to do? We're going to make sure they go to the best schools, we'll make sure they have the best health care, will make sure they will have the best desk. But do they really turn out to be the best as we see it? Because what they are looking for, or let's put it this way, we think we have done the best for them to make them happy.\n\nDo they make them happy? In fact, half the time what we have done to make them happy, make them most unhappy. But because that's the only means which we know to transfer happiness to someone else. Naveda, Yajna, Adhyayan, Nadane, chakriya bhi na tapo bhi ugrahi. Others are trying, not other, all others are trying in this world by the Veda, Veda, Dhyana, by learning Vedas, we want to learn. When I was a teenager and I see people talking about Bhagavad Gita and I used to say, I understand nothing, but someday I really want to know what they're talking about.\n\nSo we want to get the knowledge which we think the others have. So we learn Veda, Yajna, all the things which we think is good. With doing Dana, I remember in my childhood when Surat, when there is eclipse, everybody comes out in a street and then the beggars come and they know that now there's a big business time because people are doing dana at that time. Because if you do that it multiplies so many times. So Dana, we obviously value the Importance of charity. So we have this notion that doing Dana, I get the merits and that merit will earn me to see that source of infinite happiness, the Lord Veda.\n\nYagna, Dhyana Dana, Kriya bhi, Kriya bhi. Now actions, obviously they translate as rituals, you know, because religious actions in traditional sense is ritual. That I have to do this Archana or I have to do this Puja because that gives me merits or do austerities or poas. This many Guru Sukruvar Sahniva will do this, this many, all this. We are doing it to ultimately find what that source of happiness which is infinite. I want that unconditioned happiness, unending happiness.\n\nAnd I want to do that by gaining this Bhagavan very clearly say, na veda nad na kriyabhi na tapobi. It's not that Bhagavan is condemning this. Somewhat in a putting it down tone, I said this. That's not the intention. Those are the means to prepare your mind and intellect to level where he will shine through. We have discussed that a seeker's job is only to do the Antharkarana Shuddhe.\n\nAs per our Veda Vedanta. Our job is simply to make our Antakana internal instrument which is mind and intellect, to clean it up, make it ready for his reflection into it. Because right now it is so clouded with all the layers or the layers of our vasanas on it that the reflection is not clear. We have seen in Vedanta 3 Types of impurities can be. The one is more like smoke in front of a mirror. While you can't see a reflection that is smoke in front of the mirror.\n\nWell, it is very easy to dispel the smoke. But then others leave the dust layer on that. And third, we say, just as in the womb the fetus is enveloped into the matter which is even more difficult. Our job is this mind with these impurities. We need to just clean up the impurities. All this we have discussed is actually just for the Antakarana Shuddhe.\n\nVeda, Dhyana, Yajna, Tapa Dhaana, Kriya. All that is to Antakaran Shuddhi. If you are doing it for Antakaran Shuddhi, it will gain its results. This is all I have to do and I'm done with it. And therefore he says, you are not getting it. So Bhagavan said, evam rupya sakya aham nuloke.\n\nThis form of mind not possible by this in this world of man, our world. Drastum tvat anniena kuru pravera Arjuna is kuru praveer or the best among the kuru. It is not possible in this world other than you to see this by only being doing this because these are the means and not the end which we normally confuse this as an end. Next verse we just seen is mate vyatama. But obviously now this is a verse which shows what state Arjuna was in. Mate vyatama cha vimooda bhavah.\n\nBut don't be disturbed and don't be fearful. I can see clearly on your face that you are disturbed, overwhelmed and fearful by looking at this terrible form of mind. Dristva rupam ghauram idruk mama idham. Having seen such a terrible form of mine, See again there's somewhere in the translation it says terrific form of mind. But say Gauram and say terrible. Whether it is terrible is terrific is who decides that?\n\nFrom our point of view something may be terrible. From some other perspective it is terrific when somebody is taking those pictures of tsunamis from a distance from some satellite and then we are seeing those such a terrific form of tsunami. But guy at that whatever the beach where the tsunami is coming in Japan or wherever that is, it's a terrible form of tsunami. So he said, having seen this terrible form of mind, because you seeing it as a jiva, as a limited being, trying to comprehend this overwhelming nature of the self, it's a terrible form. Vyapeta bhi prithamanah with your fear dispelled, get your fear out and prithvamanah have a loving nature again. Punastvam tadeva me roopam idam prapsya.\n\nAnd now see this roop which will get your fear off and a loving form. And now comes a little bit of a controversy. Bhagavan showed it to Arjuna when he came back from his Virat Swarupa to this. Now obviously he asked for Kritinam gadinam chakrinam Haslam. You know, Vishnu Roop Bhagavad Gita really doesn't say that. Some commentaries have said Bhagavad Gita simply says he came back to his original song form as Vasudev Krishna.",

      "commentary": "We have been discussing chapter 11, Viswarupadarsana yoga. Yoga of Revelation of the Cosmic Form. So we have seen in this chapter that Bhagavan showed his cosmic form. So what does that mean? Cosmic form is that form which includes all the forms in this cosmos, in this world, in this Jagat. So all the forms at one place, from past, present and future.\n\nSo that negates time. If there is no past, present and future, there is no time. If there is only one entity, one supreme being, then there is no time. I don't require any time to meet myself. I am always there, so there is no time required. It is when I have to meet somebody else, then I have to have time.\n\nThe two, it requires time and we can say we'll meet at 10 o' clock every Sunday morning. So as long as there are more than one, there will be time. If there's only one, there is no time. So in this cosmic form, everything is crunched into one. Past, present, future. There is no time also.\n\nIf there is one, there is no space. If there is one dot, the dot doesn't require any space. Instead of two dots, there is a distance between the two and there's space between the two. The space is created only when there are two. So in this, all forms are in one. Therefore there is no space also.\n\nBecause all forms are within that one form, that one form now becomes the form, the cosmic form. And therefore there is no space. So the space and time are both negated. In cosmic form, to have any form, what you require is space and time. Without space and time, there is no form. So the actual vision that Arjuna had was that of a formless space, supreme being.\n\nBut then he describes all these beings in it, I see Brahma, I see Vishnu, I see all the Siddhas, I see all Rakshasas, I see Dhritarashtra, the Sons. So in the supreme, all the probabilities, infinite probabilities, the infinite amount of forms you can imagine, you can create in that infinite. It is something like if one of my Clients come to me and say that Neil, here is a piece of land. Design a building, I said, but what kind of a building? What do you want to use it for? If you leave everything up to me, I have infinite possibilities what I can design, what type of building I can design.\n\nThere I can say it can be hospital, it can be jail. Well, it can be office building, it can be multi storied office building. Maybe it's a single story office building. No, no, it can be residential. Well, maybe multi storage. Infinite possibilities.\n\nTo really design a building I have to eliminate all other possibilities and narrow it down to one. It can be hospital because it's not possible here, not needed here. It cannot be jailed because we have no authority to imprison anybody. So let's not do imprison. Have to come down to negate everything with only one choice and that becomes my choice. So for any form that's necessary that you should negate all other forms.\n\nSo when I say, let's say Prakashji comes to the room and I see Prakash Ji, what I have to do is I have to negate all 7 billion people on this planet. That all remaining 7 billion people is not that, that's Prakash ji. So to create a form from a probability of infinite probabilities in supreme, I have to negate all other probabilities. So here Arjuna can see whatever he wants to see. So is the case with us, because we see from a narrow perspective and we negate things and it comes down to a particular form. So here Bhagwana showed Arjuna the supreme form which is formless but has infinite probabilities and possibilities of forms.\n\nSo that was the reason. And therefore Arjuna could see things which are delightful and those frightful. When it comes to the delightful, when we think about God as divine, it is very pleasant to think about God. But when we think about God who is also responsible or he is also enabling the evil in this world is very frightful. Therefore we say, Bhagavan, I don't want to see that part of yours. Show me something which I can live with.\n\nSo that's what we have seen so far. Arjuna requested, put me back where I was before. So Bhagavan showed him the same Swarupa as Vasudeva, as Vasudeva's son which he was before as his charioteer. And then Bhagavan told him that, look, this form of mind which you have seen, which has all the Forms included in any past, present, future is very difficult to see. It is auspicious but very difficult to see. And therefore nobody has seen it before.\n\nYou have seen it simply because of my grace, Atma, Yoga. By my yoga I could make you see this thing. But it is not possible to see through all the other preparations. Learning Veda, Dhyana, Yajna, their means but not the goal. You cannot achieve the goal by just preparing for it. Na aham vedena tapasa, nadanea, ijya, shakya evam Vidav drastum, as you have seen, is not possible through study of Vedas or austerities, on charities or even sacrifices.\n\nIt almost looks like Bhagavan is discouraging us. None of this is going to be helpful. Bhagawan is actually making statement of fact. We can learn from this verse the secret of success in anything. So just by going to architecture school, I can become a successful architect. Many of my classmates are in the United States.\n\nThey all went to the same school. We all got the architecture degree. None of them are practicing architecture. They're successful in what they are doing. They own motels, they own gas stations and big houses and many cars. But they're not practicing architecture.\n\nSo just by going to architecture school, I cannot become a successful architect. So is this case with the doctors, engineers. So what makes a person a successful professional? The first is his devotion to the profession. He has to be devoted to his profession. When I came to this country, big recession time, 1982, huge recession, I was in Houston.\n\nSo pipe drafting was big thing there because it was all companies there. And then you'll forget about architecture, do pipe drafting, you will make a lot of money. And I said, there's one thing I will not do is leave architecture. I'll find jobs somewhere. Even drafting in architecture acceptable, but not pipe drafting. So unless you are devoted to a profession, so that's the first requirement, that also doesn't make me successful as designer of buildings because I need grace of my clients.\n\nI may be the best architect on this planet, but there is no client that I can convince that I can design his or her building. Then I won't be able to design. So to become a successful architect who can design a building and construct it, I need grace of my clients. So ultimate thing I need is a grace from whom I am seeking that work, all that achievement. But to get there, I have to do a lot more. I can't really just come out and say I'm devoted to architecture and Give me work.\n\nThat's also not possible. You have to train yourself continuously. So that you become proficient and efficient. Then somebody will see that you are capable of doing so. So Bhagavan said, two things I require. One is your devotion to your goal.\n\nAnd then grace from whoever is the fruit giver. Whoever is responsible to give you that work or that achievement. So Bhagavan said, Na aham vedh tapasana Dhaneana ijjaya sake evam vidodrastum drasvanasimyata is you have seen me. I am not possible to be seen through all these things. We think that preparing ourselves is good enough. But once it is not good enough, what you require is Baksyatu Ananya Sakya aham Eva Vidha Arjuna Gnatum drastum Chatatwena Praveshtum chaparantapa.\n\nIt is not possible by just preparation. If you are devoted to me, Bhaktiyatu Ananya. By single minded devotion it is possible the Bhagawan has given you the secret. But what you really require is single pointed devotion. And devotion as we have discussed many times is nothing but love for the divine. And love is nothing but identification.\n\nI love someone because I identify with that person. Because I identify with this class. I like to discuss Bhagavad Gita. You like to discuss Bhagavad Gita. I love people who come to this class. So this identification is love.\n\nI don't love my neighbour's child. As much as I love my own child. I identify with my child, my son. So love is nothing but pure identification. Without identification you cannot love anything or any being. So love for the divine is devotion.\n\nBut I cannot love the divine without knowing the divine. And therefore Bhagavan spent last five chapters to define what the divine is. Culminated into this Viswaroo Pradarshan. So Bhagavan said it is possible. And then Bhagavan gives the steps of that vision. Gnatum drastum cha tatvena praveshtum chaparandapa.\n\nFirst you have to know. For identifying with anyone. I need to know that person. I have to know that person. I can't fall in love with a girl who I never met. I have to know her first.\n\nSo gnatum knowing first. In our studies we say the first is Savannam. Listen to the Scriptures listen to the nature of the Lord. So this is what we are doing. We are listening from Bhagavan. Then you will see me.\n\nThen you will know me. You will see me in my essence. Wherever I see, I see you. So that's the vision Drastram. So in our path of Bhakti Mananam reflection, I create a perception of what I have learned. The Bhagavan's form is like that.\n\nAnd then I reflect on it. Have you seen carry catchers of Vishwarupdarshan? The painters painted the iconic calendars. We all have seen Bhagavan with many heads and many arms and fire coming out of his mouth. Painters and limitations. But if you have listened to the five chapters carefully and then you reflect on it then Bhagavan said, you will see me in my essence.\n\nThe last stage is Praveshtum. Then you will identify with me. Pravisham is to become one. Enter into that self. So I am right now in my limited being. I'm completely identified with this body, this mind, this intellect.\n\nI call me identify so complete that there is no real rivalry between my right hand and left hand, my right leg and left leg. So the complete identification with this limited self I.e. praveshtam entered into that me. Bhagavan said, if you reflect on that Viswaroop then you will also enter into that. You will identify with that supreme as you identify with your limited self right now. Here the operative word is Ananya Bhakti.\n\nWith single minded devotion, you shall be able to know me. You shall be able to see me. You shall be able to enter into me. The last word he gives us how to do that. So first he says, this vision is not possible without my grace. But it is possible if you are single mindedly devoted to me.\n\nBut how can I develop that single minded devotion? If now Bhagavan is saying in the last verse of this chapter, Mat Karma Krat very first thing he said, do everything for me. Continue doing everything you're doing right now. You think you're doing it for you. You're doing it for your family, you're doing it for your country. He said, just think, it's all me.",
      "reflection": "Sit for a moment with the vastness of existence—billions of stars, billions of years, billions of beings. Let yourself feel small in the face of it all.\n\nThen remember: you are not separate from this vastness. You are the universe looking at itself. Both the terror and the wonder are appropriate responses to ultimate reality.\n\nThe cosmic vision shows that time devours all things. What would change if you held this truth constantly in awareness? Would petty concerns still trouble you? Would you use your time differently?"

      "commentary": "We have been discussing chapter 11, Viswarupadarsana yoga. Yoga of Revelation of the Cosmic Form. So we have seen in this chapter that Bhagavan showed his cosmic form. So what does that mean? Cosmic form is that form which includes all the forms in this cosmos, in this world, in this Jagat. So all the forms at one place, from past, present and future.\n\nSo that negates time. If there is no past, present and future, there is no time. If there is only one entity, one supreme being, then there is no time. I don't require any time to meet myself. I am always there, so there is no time required. It is when I have to meet somebody else, then I have to have time.\n\nThe two, it requires time and we can say we'll meet at 10 o' clock every Sunday morning. So as long as there are more than one, there will be time. If there's only one, there is no time. So in this cosmic form, everything is crunched into one. Past, present, future. There is no time also.\n\nIf there is one, there is no space. If there is one dot, the dot doesn't require any space. Instead of two dots, there is a distance between the two and there's space between the two. The space is created only when there are two. So in this, all forms are in one. Therefore there is no space also.\n\nBecause all forms are within that one form, that one form now becomes the form, the cosmic form. And therefore there is no space. So the space and time are both negated. In cosmic form, to have any form, what you require is space and time. Without space and time, there is no form. So the actual vision that Arjuna had was that of a formless space, supreme being.\n\nBut then he describes all these beings in it, I see Brahma, I see Vishnu, I see all the Siddhas, I see all Rakshasas, I see Dhritarashtra, the Sons. So in the supreme, all the probabilities, infinite probabilities, the infinite amount of forms you can imagine, you can create in that infinite. It is something like if one of my Clients come to me and say that Neil, here is a piece of land. Design a building, I said, but what kind of a building? What do you want to use it for? If you leave everything up to me, I have infinite possibilities what I can design, what type of building I can design.\n\nThere I can say it can be hospital, it can be jail. Well, it can be office building, it can be multi storied office building. Maybe it's a single story office building. No, no, it can be residential. Well, maybe multi storage. Infinite possibilities.\n\nTo really design a building I have to eliminate all other possibilities and narrow it down to one. It can be hospital because it's not possible here, not needed here. It cannot be jailed because we have no authority to imprison anybody. So let's not do imprison. Have to come down to negate everything with only one choice and that becomes my choice. So for any form that's necessary that you should negate all other forms.\n\nSo when I say, let's say Prakashji comes to the room and I see Prakash Ji, what I have to do is I have to negate all 7 billion people on this planet. That all remaining 7 billion people is not that, that's Prakash ji. So to create a form from a probability of infinite probabilities in supreme, I have to negate all other probabilities. So here Arjuna can see whatever he wants to see. So is the case with us, because we see from a narrow perspective and we negate things and it comes down to a particular form. So here Bhagwana showed Arjuna the supreme form which is formless but has infinite probabilities and possibilities of forms.\n\nSo that was the reason. And therefore Arjuna could see things which are delightful and those frightful. When it comes to the delightful, when we think about God as divine, it is very pleasant to think about God. But when we think about God who is also responsible or he is also enabling the evil in this world is very frightful. Therefore we say, Bhagavan, I don't want to see that part of yours. Show me something which I can live with.\n\nSo that's what we have seen so far. Arjuna requested, put me back where I was before. So Bhagavan showed him the same Swarupa as Vasudeva, as Vasudeva's son which he was before as his charioteer. And then Bhagavan told him that, look, this form of mind which you have seen, which has all the Forms included in any past, present, future is very difficult to see. It is auspicious but very difficult to see. And therefore nobody has seen it before.\n\nYou have seen it simply because of my grace, Atma, Yoga. By my yoga I could make you see this thing. But it is not possible to see through all the other preparations. Learning Veda, Dhyana, Yajna, their means but not the goal. You cannot achieve the goal by just preparing for it. Na aham vedena tapasa, nadanea, ijya, shakya evam Vidav drastum, as you have seen, is not possible through study of Vedas or austerities, on charities or even sacrifices.\n\nIt almost looks like Bhagavan is discouraging us. None of this is going to be helpful. Bhagawan is actually making statement of fact. We can learn from this verse the secret of success in anything. So just by going to architecture school, I can become a successful architect. Many of my classmates are in the United States.\n\nThey all went to the same school. We all got the architecture degree. None of them are practicing architecture. They're successful in what they are doing. They own motels, they own gas stations and big houses and many cars. But they're not practicing architecture.\n\nSo just by going to architecture school, I cannot become a successful architect. So is this case with the doctors, engineers. So what makes a person a successful professional? The first is his devotion to the profession. He has to be devoted to his profession. When I came to this country, big recession time, 1982, huge recession, I was in Houston.\n\nSo pipe drafting was big thing there because it was all companies there. And then you'll forget about architecture, do pipe drafting, you will make a lot of money. And I said, there's one thing I will not do is leave architecture. I'll find jobs somewhere. Even drafting in architecture acceptable, but not pipe drafting. So unless you are devoted to a profession, so that's the first requirement, that also doesn't make me successful as designer of buildings because I need grace of my clients.\n\nI may be the best architect on this planet, but there is no client that I can convince that I can design his or her building. Then I won't be able to design. So to become a successful architect who can design a building and construct it, I need grace of my clients. So ultimate thing I need is a grace from whom I am seeking that work, all that achievement. But to get there, I have to do a lot more. I can't really just come out and say I'm devoted to architecture and Give me work.\n\nThat's also not possible. You have to train yourself continuously. So that you become proficient and efficient.

But once it is not good enough, what you require is Baksyatu Ananya Sakya aham Eva Vidha Arjuna Gnatum drastum Chatatwena Praveshtum chaparantapa.\n\nIt is not possible by just preparation. If you are devoted to me, Bhaktiyatu Ananya. By single minded devotion it is possible the Bhagawan has given you the secret. But what you really require is single pointed devotion. And devotion as we have discussed many times is nothing but love for the divine. And love is nothing but identification.\n\nI love someone because I identify with that person. Because I identify with this class. I like to discuss Bhagavad Gita. You like to discuss Bhagavad Gita. I love people who come to this class. So this identification is love.\n\nI don't love my neighbour's child. As much as I love my own child. I identify with my child, my son. So love is nothing but pure identification. Without identification you cannot love anything or any being. So love for the divine is devotion.\n\nBut I cannot love the divine without knowing the divine. And therefore Bhagavan spent last five chapters to define what the divine is. Culminated into this Viswaroo Pradarshan. So Bhagavan said it is possible.

You will identify with that supreme as you identify with your limited self right now. Here the operative word is Ananya Bhakti.\n\nWith single minded devotion, you shall be able to know me. You shall be able to see me. You shall be able to enter into me. The last word he gives us how to do that. So first he says, this vision is not possible without my grace. But it is possible if you are single mindedly devoted to me.\n\nBut how can I develop that single minded devotion? If now Bhagavan is saying in the last verse of this chapter, Mat Karma Krat very first thing he said, do everything for me. Continue doing everything you're doing right now.

      "commentary": " Shri Purohit Swami did not comment on this sloka\n\nWhat is my purpose and destiny? So we had been discussing chapter one, Arjuna's Grief. Arjuna, Vishada, Yoga. This is a contradictory term, Vishada and Yoga. Grief cannot be in Yoga, we are always in Yoga. When we are in grief, this is the one time we really align ourselves to our own self, seeking for an answer, how do I get out of this grief?\n\nSo grief also is one form of Yoga. In fact, it aligns you more to your own reality than when the time is good, then we are more outwardly seeking things outside. When we are in grief, we are seeking inward and say, how do I get out of this sorrow and find peace? So therefore this chapter is also called Yoga, Yoga of Arjuna's Grief. And the grief basically started with his looking at his situation. So so far we have seen that Dhritarashtra was curious what's going on out of his ignorance about what's happening.\n\nCuriosity is the manifestation of ignorance. Unless we are ignorant, we cannot be curious. We can only be curious about something we are ignorant about. We cannot be curious about something we already know. So Dhritarashtra, being ignorant about what's going on, he's curious about what's happening at the battlefield of Kurukshetra, he asked Sanjaya. And then what we have seen is Sanjay's narration.\n\nSanjaya first narrated what Duryodhan was doing. Duryodhana has gauged his situation, came to the conclusion we may not have enough resources. And then Bheeshma declared the war by blowing his own conch. And once he blew his conch, everybody blew their own conch. Now we have seen that the situation is such that everybody blew their own conches. And there was so much sound, there was so much chaos that everybody were trembling with fear.\n\nNow we are coming back to what Arjuna is doing. So the last three verses we have seen, it says Vyavasthitan, Dhrushtva, Dhatrastra and Kapit Dvajaha. Having seen this, the army of Duryodhana, Dharatarashtra, the Kauraval army assembled in the battlefield Kapit dwajah. One whose flag has a monkey, Hanuman. We don't say Kapidwajahai here. Basically Hanuman is a symbol of air, Maruta shyaputraha.\n\nSo basically his symbol says my chariot flies like wind, that powerful chariot, that's his symbol. So the one whose symbol is Kapidrajah Arjuna pravrutte hai Sastha sampathe Dhanur udyamaha pandavah. He saw that the people are ready to discharge their weapons, war is declared, everybody is anxious and as I said, always the first person has to do something. Then this everybody, one person blew conch, everybody blew conches. First person shoots an arrow. Everybody starts shooting.\n\nNobody has shot the arrow yet, but everybody anxious to discharge their weapons. So Arjuna also picks up his Gandhi. And then he says, rushikesam tada vakyam idam aha Mahipate O King. Sanjaya addressing to Dhritarashtra. Now that Arjuna has seen this army assembled in front of him, ready to discharge weapons, he picked up his Gandhi. Basically he's ready.\n\nHe probably wants to be the first one to shoot an arrow, picks up the Gandhi. But then as any good commander, he wants to make sure that he has a complete understanding of what's going on. So then he says, He said the following sentence to Hrishikesh Krishna, one with the short hair. Now this is a half verse. This is where the half verse Sanjay stops. Then we go straight to Arjuna.\n\nSo sometimes we hear Sanjay's commentary, sometimes Sanjay just puts it directly to listen to what Arjuna is saying or Krishna is saying. Arjuna oacha senayoho ubayoho madhya ratham sthapaya me Achyuda O Achyuda, another name of Krishna, one who never fails you as Achudha O Achuda, take my chariot and station it right in the middle of the two armies. Which is basically something any general would do. When we ready to attack Iraq or Iran, we'll say, oh no, we know they have wmd. Well, we have the satellites to figure it out. We saw it that Saddam Hussein has all those WMDs, weapon of mass destruction.\n\nAnd now therefore we are ready to attack him, as you know, at his level. He said, well, let me be in a position where I can gauge the complete situation of who I have to fight so that I can strategize accordingly. Anxious soldier, anxious warrior, very confident, ready to discharge his arrow. He just wants his chariot to be in a proper location. And as Swamiji says, he shows his confidence. He says may ratham my ratha.\n\nSo he is a commander who is ready to give his command and do his duty. Yavat etan niriksheham. Why I wanted to do that because I would like to see Yudhung kaman, avasthitaan, which generals, which warriors are assembled in the other army. Obviously they didn't have satellite pictures. You have to have eye contact to figure out what's happening. So you need to a station point where your perspective is panoramic, where you can see everybody.\n\nSo therefore it's a put me in a position where I can panoramically see who are assembled here. Duryodhana has already done that. Duryodhana went through who are on the other side. We haven't heard from Arjuna. Now Arjuna says I want to say Kair maya saha yuddhavyam asmin ranam samuddya me who are desirous of fighting at the eve of this battle. Eve of the battle, at just the beginning of this battle.\n\nLet me know with whom I must fight, who I'm going to fight. Yotsya manam avekhseham etihtra sama gataha Dhartra Rashtra Siddhur buddhehe Yudde priya. He shows his disgust for the people who are in the durabuddehe in their wrong notion Yotsyamanam avekshe aham. Because I would like to desire to observe those who are assembled. Ya ethe atra sama ga taha. They're assembled here Dhartra Rashtrasya Durbuddehe priya Savah who are here to fight, vising to please in battle the evil minded son of Dhritarashtra.\n\nThey are pleasing somebody who has evil mind Duryodhana. So they are not really using their own judgment what is right and wrong. They just want to please somebody, whether he is wrong or right, just because he is in power, just because he is someone they need to align with. So I want to see who those people are. Verse 24 onward says Sanjaya Vachana. We are getting back to Sanjay Evamuktva rushike saha Guda kena bharata senayoho Ubayoho madhya sthapa yitva rathutamam.\n\nJust as he said, Krishna established the chariot thus addressed by Gurakesha. Just as instructed by Arjuna. Shikesha situated the best of the chariots between the two armies. This is where the turning point is. Here is how he sees what the situation is. Sometimes in our ignorance we are very comfortable in what we are doing because we do not know the rest of the story.\n\nSo we are very gung ho on doing something. It is suddenly when we have the complete picture that what am I doing is not just truly good it can also affect people. Go ahead and have this gas pipeline or whatever. The fractured gas looks very good. It's when you have a complete picture of how many people get affected by it. What is the effect on the natural resources.\n\nThen you start questioning whether that is a right thing to do or a wrong thing to do. Till he did not have the clear picture he was very gung ho that I want to fight this battle. I'll kill those people who are aligning with this Durbuddhya. We will see what happens. We completed chapter 11, Vishwarupadarshan. Now we have started discussing chapter 12, Bhakti Yoga.\n\nSo we have learned so far in Bhagavad Gita about our limited self in the first portion of the Bhagavad Gita up to chapter five. Then it culminated into Dhyana Yoga. Once you know about the makeup of your being, you have to contemplate upon who I am. Then everything we learned in that portion says that that which I consider myself so far is not me. Everything I have considered so far as me is this body, this mind, this intellect, my accomplishment, my relationships. All this I considered to be me.\n\nAnd it turned out it is not me. I is something other than all these things. So contemplate upon the idea about who I am, that I am something other than this body, other than this mind, other than this intellect. And in that contemplation, what I find is myself. When I negate all the things which I currently consider as me, but turned out to be my equipment, my achievement, my accomplishment, my relationship, you negate all of that. And then what is left is Me.\n\nAnd that I is no different than the Supreme I. That's what we learned in that segment of Bhagavad Gita. So the next segment, which we embarked on learning was to know about the nature of the Supreme Self and how I can relate myself to the Supreme Self. So we have learned that his nature is imperishable, immutable, all pervading, omnipresent, omniscient. And everything in my world that I know is strung into him like the beads and necklace. So that segment, after discussing the nature of the self, ended into a chapter 11 which showed the totality of that reason.\n\nIf I have that identification not with the limited Self, but with the Greater Self, what will be my vision of that Supreme Purusha, the Ultimate Being? That everything will be included in it. Once I have that understanding of the relationship between my limited self and that supreme Self, it has to end into devotion toward the Supreme Self. So once I identify with the supreme Self. I'll be devoted to that supreme self. So the next chapter, Bhakti Yoga, Yoga of devotion.\n\nBut most of us really get scared by the very word bhakti. Because unlike the Gnanayana Karma where I have some control over it, I have control over actions. At least I know that when I want to act, I will have ability to act. And it will be my will to engage in actions so I can motivate myself to act. So there is something I can do about it. Same way I think I have some control over it, I can learn when I want to know.\n\nIf I think I'm ignorant about something and I really want to become knowledgeable, there are means available to me. And if I can engage in it, then obviously I will get the knowledge. So Gnana and Karma, we feel somewhat comfortable because we have something to say about it. How I engage into it, when it comes to bhakti, we are completely lost. Bhakti is an emotional response. And emotions are not something I have control over.\n\nThat's what I learned all my life that why did you do that, Neil? Because I couldn't control my emotions. I cried in public or I got angry in public. Emotions is something we are afraid that we may not have control over. So bhakti is an emotional response to something or someone I identify with. When I identify with someone, my emotional response is to like him or her or it.\n\nSo that's an emotional response and that we are very unsure about. That's what we get afraid of. Everybody says love God. Every religion says love God. Every teacher says, you should love God. But how should I love God?\n\nNobody has been very clear about love does not come because I try hard. Try to love someone is very difficult thing. Neil, you should love him, but I don't like him. So we are very unsure about how I can engage myself in Bhakti Yoga. So therefore the many, many teachers have defined Bhakti in different ways. There is a very authoritative book called Narada Bhakti kshatra.",
      "reflection": "Consider the qualities of the ideal devotee described in this chapter: free from ego, equal toward friend and foe, steady in all circumstances. Don't judge yourself against this standard—just let it serve as a direction.\n\nWhich quality feels most needed in your life right now? How might you nurture it? The path of devotion isn't about achieving perfection but about orienting the heart toward what is highest.\n\nNotice the moments today when you feel most connected to something greater than yourself. What conditions support that connection? How might you cultivate them?"

      "commentary": "What is my purpose and destiny? So we had been discussing chapter one, Arjuna's Grief. Arjuna, Vishada, Yoga. This is a contradictory term, Vishada and Yoga. Grief cannot be in Yoga, we are always in Yoga. When we are in grief, this is the one time we really align ourselves to our own self, seeking for an answer, how do I get out of this grief?\n\nSo grief also is one form of Yoga. In fact, it aligns you more to your own reality than when the time is good, then we are more outwardly seeking things outside. When we are in grief, we are seeking inward and say, how do I get out of this sorrow and find peace? So therefore this chapter is also called Yoga, Yoga of Arjuna's Grief. And the grief basically started with his looking at his situation. So so far we have seen that Dhritarashtra was curious what's going on out of his ignorance about what's happening.\n\nCuriosity is the manifestation of ignorance. Unless we are ignorant, we cannot be curious. We can only be curious about something we are ignorant about. We cannot be curious about something we already know. So Dhritarashtra, being ignorant about what's going on, he's curious about what's happening at the battlefield of Kurukshetra, he asked Sanjaya. And then what we have seen is Sanjay's narration.\n\nSanjaya first narrated what Duryodhan was doing. Duryodhana has gauged his situation, came to the conclusion we may not have enough resources. And then Bheeshma declared the war by blowing his own conch. And once he blew his conch, everybody blew their own conch. Now we have seen that the situation is such that everybody blew their own conches. And there was so much sound, there was so much chaos that everybody were trembling with fear.\n\nNow we are coming back to what Arjuna is doing. So the last three verses we have seen, it says Vyavasthitan, Dhrushtva, Dhatrastra and Kapit Dvajaha. Having seen this, the army of Duryodhana, Dharatarashtra, the Kauraval army assembled in the battlefield Kapit dwajah. One whose flag has a monkey, Hanuman. We don't say Kapidwajahai here. Basically Hanuman is a symbol of air, Maruta shyaputraha.\n\nSo basically his symbol says my chariot flies like wind, that powerful chariot, that's his symbol. So the one whose symbol is Kapidrajah Arjuna pravrutte hai Sastha sampathe Dhanur udyamaha pandavah. He saw that the people are ready to discharge their weapons, war is declared, everybody is anxious and as I said, always the first person has to do something. Then this everybody, one person blew conch, everybody blew conches. First person shoots an arrow. Everybody starts shooting.\n\nNobody has shot the arrow yet, but everybody anxious to discharge their weapons. So Arjuna also picks up his Gandhi. And then he says, rushikesam tada vakyam idam aha Mahipate O King. Sanjaya addressing to Dhritarashtra. Now that Arjuna has seen this army assembled in front of him, ready to discharge weapons, he picked up his Gandhi. Basically he's ready.\n\nHe probably wants to be the first one to shoot an arrow, picks up the Gandhi. But then as any good commander, he wants to make sure that he has a complete understanding of what's going on. So then he says, He said the following sentence to Hrishikesh Krishna, one with the short hair. Now this is a half verse. This is where the half verse Sanjay stops. Then we go straight to Arjuna.\n\nSo sometimes we hear Sanjay's commentary, sometimes Sanjay just puts it directly to listen to what Arjuna is saying or Krishna is saying. Arjuna oacha senayoho ubayoho madhya ratham sthapaya me Achyuda O Achyuda, another name of Krishna, one who never fails you as Achudha O Achuda, take my chariot and station it right in the middle of the two armies. Which is basically something any general would do. When we ready to attack Iraq or Iran, we'll say, oh no, we know they have wmd. Well, we have the satellites to figure it out. We saw it that Saddam Hussein has all those WMDs, weapon of mass destruction.\n\nAnd now therefore we are ready to attack him, as you know, at his level. He said, well, let me be in a position where I can gauge the complete situation of who I have to fight so that I can strategize accordingly. Anxious soldier, anxious warrior, very confident, ready to discharge his arrow. He just wants his chariot to be in a proper location. And as Swamiji says, he shows his confidence. He says may ratham my ratha.\n\nSo he is a commander who is ready to give his command and do his duty. Yavat etan niriksheham. Why I wanted to do that because I would like to see Yudhung kaman, avasthitaan, which generals, which warriors are assembled in the other army. Obviously they didn't have satellite pictures. You have to have eye contact to figure out what's happening. So you need to a station point where your perspective is panoramic, where you can see everybody.\n\nSo therefore it's a put me in a position where I can panoramically see who are assembled here. Duryodhana has already done that. Duryodhana went through who are on the other side. We haven't heard from Arjuna. Now Arjuna says I want to say Kair maya saha yuddhavyam asmin ranam samuddya me who are desirous of fighting at the eve of this battle. Eve of the battle, at just the beginning of this battle.\n\nLet me know with whom I must fight, who I'm going to fight. Yotsya manam avekhseham etihtra sama gataha Dhartra Rashtra Siddhur buddhehe Yudde priya. He shows his disgust for the people who are in the durabuddehe in their wrong notion Yotsyamanam avekshe aham. Because I would like to desire to observe those who are assembled. Ya ethe atra sama ga taha. They're assembled here Dhartra Rashtrasya Durbuddehe priya Savah who are here to fight, vising to please in battle the evil minded son of Dhritarashtra.\n\nThey are pleasing somebody who has evil mind Duryodhana. So they are not really using their own judgment what is right and wrong. They just want to please somebody, whether he is wrong or right, just because he is in power, just because he is someone they need to align with. So I want to see who those people are. Verse 24 onward says Sanjaya Vachana. We are getting back to Sanjay Evamuktva rushike saha Guda kena bharata senayoho Ubayoho madhya sthapa yitva rathutamam.\n\nJust as he said, Krishna established the chariot thus addressed by Gurakesha. Just as instructed by Arjuna. Shikesha situated the best of the chariots between the two armies. This is where the turning point is. Here is how he sees what the situation is. Sometimes in our ignorance we are very comfortable in what we are doing because we do not know the rest of the story.\n\nSo we are very gung ho on doing something. It is suddenly when we have the complete picture that what am I doing is not just truly good it can also affect people. Go ahead and have this gas pipeline or whatever. The fractured gas looks very good. It's when you have a complete picture of how many people get affected by it. What is the effect on the natural resources.\n\nThen you start questioning whether that is a right thing to do or a wrong thing to do. Till he did not have the clear picture he was very gung ho that I want to fight this battle. I'll kill those people who are aligning with this Durbuddhya. We will see what happens. We completed chapter 11, Vishwarupadarshan. Now we have started discussing chapter 12, Bhakti Yoga.\n\nSo we have learned so far in Bhagavad Gita about our limited self in the first portion of the Bhagavad Gita up to chapter five. Then it culminated into Dhyana Yoga. Once you know about the makeup of your being, you have to contemplate upon who I am. Then everything we learned in that portion says that that which I consider myself so far is not me. Everything I have considered so far as me is this body, this mind, this intellect, my accomplishment, my relationships. All this I considered to be me.\n\nAnd it turned out it is not me. I is something other than all these things. So contemplate upon the idea about who I am, that I am something other than this body, other than this mind, other than this intellect. And in that contemplation, what I find is myself. When I negate all the things which I currently consider as me, but turned out to be my equipment, my achievement, my accomplishment, my relationship, you negate all of that. And then what is left is Me.\n\nAnd that I is no different than the Supreme I. That's what we learned in that segment of Bhagavad Gita. So the next segment, which we embarked on learning was to know about the nature of the Supreme Self and how I can relate myself to the Supreme Self. So we have learned that his nature is imperishable, immutable, all pervading, omnipresent, omniscient. And everything in my world that I know is strung into him like the beads and necklace. So that segment, after discussing the nature of the self, ended into a chapter 11 which showed the totality of that reason.\n\nIf I have that identification not with the limited Self, but with the Greater Self, what will be my vision of that Supreme Purusha, the Ultimate Being? That everything will be included in it. Once I have that understanding of the relationship between my limited self and that supreme Self, it has to end into devotion toward the Supreme Self. So once I identify with the supreme Self. I'll be devoted to that supreme self. So the next chapter, Bhakti Yoga, Yoga of devotion.\n\nBut most of us really get scared by the very word bhakti. Because unlike the Gnanayana Karma where I have some control over it, I have control over actions. At least I know that when I want to act, I will have ability to act. And it will be my will to engage in actions so I can motivate myself to act. So there is something I can do about it. Same way I think I have some control over it, I can learn when I want to know.\n\nIf I think I'm ignorant about something and I really want to become knowledgeable, there are means available to me. And if I can engage in it, then obviously I will get the knowledge. So Gnana and Karma, we feel somewhat comfortable because we have something to say about it. How I engage into it, when it comes to bhakti, we are completely lost. Bhakti is an emotional response. And emotions are not something I have control over.\n\nThat's what I learned all my life that why did you do that, Neil? Because I couldn't control my emotions. I cried in public or I got angry in public. Emotions is something we are afraid that we may not have control over. So bhakti is an emotional response to something or someone I identify with. When I identify with someone, my emotional response is to like him or her or it.\n\nSo that's an emotional response and that we are very unsure about. That's what we get afraid of. Everybody says love God. Every religion says love God. Every teacher says, you should love God. But how should I love God?\n\nNobody has been very clear about love does not come because I try hard. Try to love someone is very difficult thing. Neil, you should love him, but I don't like him. So we are very unsure about how I can engage myself in Bhakti Yoga. So therefore the many, many teachers have defined Bhakti in different ways. There is a very authoritative book called Narada Bhakti kshatra.",
      "reflection": "Consider the qualities of the ideal devotee described in this chapter: free from ego, equal toward friend and foe, steady in all circumstances. Don't judge yourself against this standard—just let it serve as a direction.\n\nWhich quality feels most needed in your life right now? How might you nurture it? The path of devotion isn't about achieving perfection but about orienting the heart toward what is highest.\n\nNotice the moments today when you feel most connected to something greater than yourself. What conditions support that connection? How might you cultivate them?"

      "commentary": "What is my purpose and destiny? So far we had been discussing the bhakti yoga chapter 12, and there are 20 verses in this chapter. It's a pretty small chapter because there is not much to tell you. Everything that has to be told is already told in the chapters before. So as we have discussed from chapter six to ten we saw the Bhagavan Sri Bhuti, his glory, his identification, how to find him in this manifest world. We saw on 6 to 10 where he said, I am in the fragrance of flower, I am the sweetness of honey, I am even in the cheating power of the cheats.\n\nWhatever you can think of is the essence of a thing or a being. The Dharma of that being or a thing is me. Thing only exists because its inherent quality to be its own Dharma. We are human beings because we have this basic qualities necessary for a human being. You take that away, you are no more human being. If a person looks like Michael Jackson, you go near, but he doesn't move.\n\nWe know you are a Madam Two Sides Museum. That's not Michael Jackson. Because that statue does not have inherent qualities required to be Michael Jackson. So that which makes you, you an I, I and it it is, Bhagavan said, is me. We have seen that from chapter six to ten, and from that we should have developed a reason to say it. But obviously that's not that simple.\n\nSo Arjuna asked bhagavan in chapter 11 that I understood all of it, but I want to experience it, I can't experience it. So with Lord's grace, he gets a divine reason to comprehend this oneness in this manifest world, which is what we had been talking about. We just can't connect it with that. And Arjuna gets connected to that where he sees this manifest world as nothing but a one being with many mouths and many hands and many legs and many things happening. With that understanding, one should develop the devotion to that being, that one supreme Being who is nothing but my own self. So the chapter 12 is the yoga of devotion.\n\nOnce you contemplated who I am, realize the nature of the supreme and realize that myself and the supreme selves are not two different selves. I must instantaneously develop identification with that supreme self, which we call it a love for the Divine devotion. So this chapter is about all the Bhakti Yoga, how to unite with yourself by devotion. And we had been talking about various paths to attain that oneness with the Supreme. And we have talked about three different three distinct paths. Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Gnana Yoga.\n\nAnd we always get because our cultural baggage. We have understood bhakti as something which happens in a temple or during bhajan time that we can associate. I'm not that kind of bhakta. Well, I don't really wear a mala and then keep kirtan and do all the kirta. I'm not a bhakta like that. So here is our chance to understand what bhakti is.\n\nSo the chapter opened with Arjuna's two obvious question. Should I be devoted to you in the form which I have seen you as Krishna or Rama or Shiva, Jesus, whatever, whom I have now developed a sense of divinity, that you are divine, I'm a mortal, that I can put my faith into that one manifestation and achieve that oneness. Or like others discussed in Vedas and Upanishads, as that being which has nirguna Niraka has no qualities, no shape and form, and that all pervading being in its unmanifest form that I should be worshipping or devoted to. And obviously Bhagavan's answer was one who gives his mind to me and then do have me as the supreme goal and do it with faith, he comes to me quicker. But the others who want to devote to the unmanifest, and if they can do the following Sam nyam indriyagram, all this sense is under control, equanimous to all. Where he can see the equanimity in this entire manifest world, he can see that there is the underlying thread in this world of plurality and this diversity which binds this entire universe into that thread which we already discussed in previous verses.\n\nSutre Eva, Maniganaha Eva, just as a thread in the necklace of the beads, we can see that. And then I, sarvabhutahi tera taha, I'm constantly engaging myself into the welfare of all the beings. Not my group of people, my family, my people, other people can go to wherever Sarvabhuta hitherta. Then he also comes to me, Bhagavan said, and then obviously the question is, then which one is better? I devote to a Particular deity being whom I feel most closer and inspired. And Bhagawan said, both are fine.\n\nBut kleso adiktarahatesham, those who devote to the unmanifest, it's a harder path. There are more obstacles on your way to achieve that. For dehavadbhee, those who are attached to the body, first qualification required for that is to have samnyam, indriya grammam, all. The senses to be under control. But if I'm not in that and have attachment to these senses in the body no matter how intellectually I consider myself non dualistic that duality will bring you down. And therefore Bhagavan says for them it is more difficulty if you are deha vadvi.\n\nNot just the indwell of the body but one who is attached to this body. I never understood the meaning of samadhi. They talk about in meditation in this. But one time Swami Tejamanda explained to. Me in one simple term. He was not addressing just to me, but an audience.\n\nBut I got it, you know, he said, you are in this state of samadhi all the time. A reference to your body. There is never a time where I am not identified with my body. Nobody has to wake me up and say, Neil, that's not you, that's you. I'm always in a state of samadhi, a reference to my body. That's actually dehavad beh.\n\nI'm attached to this body. For me, attaching to this body as an ego I and then trying to establish myself into the supreme unmanifest. Bhagavan says kleso adhiktarhatesha for them there. Are lots of difficulties. Therefore he said, easy path is maiyeva mana adasva. Give your mind to me and then do everything for me.\n\nAnd I will become the savior of you. To save you from this ocean of samsara. This ocean of experiences we have which seems infinite. I don't see the end of it. So many times I thought I got it that we told Bhagavan that oh Lord, just give me this, just give me green card and I'll be fine. When you didn't have green card, I don't know.\n\nOh Lord, give me green card. Because the green card these days takes about like eight to 10 years. I have somebody with me who has been here with me like six years now. And I applied his green card about three years ago. And we are renewing for third time. So believe it or not, his prayer to Lord is what?\n\nOh Lord, give me a green card. After that I'm taken care of, right? Green card lets you stay here. Do whatever you want to do. And as soon as you get green card. What oh Lord, Find a right partner.\n\nSo now I can settle down. And then it continues. Many, many times we found that there is an end to this difficulties. I have the sorrows I have. But the moment we get there we realize no, no. The infinite experiences which gives me joys and sorrows.\n\nIt never comes with a pure joy. I really want to achieve that. There is no sorrow but this Sansar Samsarati. The constantly changing life of mine. Where this infinite experience is, I don't see the end of it. One thing ends, the new thing starts.\n\nYou know, Bhagavan says, for those who have given their mind to me. Have supreme faith in me, I become their savior. They are not capable by themselves to cross this ocean of infinite experiences. Infinite experience of finite world. I will make this savior for them. To save them and take them to the other side.\n\nWhere there is no sorrow. Where there is pure happiness. What you are looking for. There is no ignorance about who I am. And there is no death. There is no end of me.\n\nThere is no ignorance and there is no sorrow. So it's all about mind that we figured out. Bhagavan never said give me your intellect and body. Intellect is nothing but a memory bank of my experiences. I think I know based on only my experiences. My mind takes the flight into unknown and then keeps on going.\n\nThere is a story about a sexchalli. One who can't control his imagination. I'd heard a story in my childhood that a Brahmin's son who obviously makes his living by getting bhiksha One day he got more vixa than he can consume. He got this flower more than he said. Well, today was a good day and I got a lot of this vixa. I cannot consume all of it.\n\nSo what I'm going to do is take the part which is left and. I'm going to sell it and make some money. Then what I'm going to do with that money? Well then I'll buy this and then I'll do this little business. Then I'll make more money and then I will have a worthy partner. Then I'll get married.\n\nAnd then I will have children. And then children will come to me. And he Kicked and he kicked that pot which has the flower in it and broke it and it all gone. So his flight of imagination of his mind took him away with it and. He lost everything which he was thinking about. So he said, that quality of the mind which we have seen is Sankalpa Shakte.\n\nYou need to curb that and put it in me. Saya nivasashi Maya Ayva ata Urdhumna Sansaya. Fix thy mind in me, place thy intellect in me too. See right now we are so much dependent on our own intellect. Doubt came to my mind. Almost everybody who learned Bhagavad Git and said all this is great but I don't think you can succeed if you just continue.\n\nYou have to have passion and thus to do this then only you can succeed in life. So if you don't succeed in life, learn this but don't get hung up on it. Because you know why I'm relying on my own intellect which is nothing but a finite experiences which says what succeeds, what doesn't. We have seen the people like Steve Jobs and they did and that's why they are succeeding. Well, I should be like that. Bhagwan said, no, don't rely on your intellect.\n\nIt will misguide you. Because it has not a capacity to go beyond the realm of your experiences. What you are trying to cross is the realm of your experiences. How can you rely on your intellect? You need to plug into the global database, Cosmic database. If I don't know anything, what do I do?\n\nI go on Google and see if I can find it. If I find it on Google, I'm fine. That entire database of the supreme intellect, that cosmic intelligence, I need to rest in that. I have to rest my intellect into that. Plug into not only my hard drive which is my intellect to the cloud computing connected to that Bhagavan. Not only give your mind to me but rest your intellect into me.\n\nRealize that there is a guide who will guide me once I put faith in him.",

      "commentary": "We have been discussing Chapter 12, Bhakti Yoga Yoga of Devotion. So in our scriptures, generally there are three paths prescribed. Karma Yoga, Gnani Yoga and Bhakti Yoga. Most people consider Bhakti Yoga to be the easiest path because it requires no special training. It does not require any special arrangement. You can just go and worship the Lord.\n\nYou go to the temple, you sing Bhajans. So we find that most people feel it is more comfortable and much easier to practice Bhakti Yoga than Karma Yoga or Gnan Yoga. That's our general understanding. But it turns out Bhakti Yoga is the most difficult path to follow because Bhakti is the emotional response to something we adore or something we worship. Devotion, as we have discussed before, is nothing but love for the divine. Narad Ji defines Bhakti in his Narad Bhakti Sutra is Satasmin Premarupa.\n\nIt is of the nature of love. It is the nature of immortality. Yatlab DVA Puma, Siddho Bhavati. Once a person achieves that Bhakti established in Bhakti Yoga, Pumane person becomes Siddha. He becomes accomplished. Amrutva Bhavti, he becomes immortal and Tripto Bhavati, he becomes completely satisfied.\n\nSo to achieve that state is not very simple. So what we find actually is it is easier for me to practice Karma Yoga. Karma Yoga is something related to my actions. I consider it is in my control. How I act in this world is something I can control. So Karma Yoga is related to my organs of actions and how I perform my actions in this world which I consider I have some control over it.\n\nAt least I can attempt to practice Karma Yoga. And then Gnana Yoga is related to intellect, acquire knowledge. So that again I find is something in my control. I can make a choice that I want to now learn this or that. If I want to learn about physics, I can make a resolve. I can go to the physics department, learn physics.\n\nSo the knowledge is something I find it within my choice. To pursue actions I find within my choice to pursue. Bhakti is related to mind. It's an emotional response. Nobody can say that I'll fall in love in 2025. You cannot plan falling in love.\n\nIt really does not go by your planning or your calendar. The love will only come if I know the divine. And therefore, we have gone through five chapters in this segment, from 7th through 11 to know the Supreme Lord. In chapter 10 and 11, Bhagawan has given Arjuna all required information, and 10 has given all the Vibhutis in the manifest world, then he gave him the total representation of his nature. If you have been equipped with that level of knowledge, then Bhakti actually becomes an automatic response. However, it is still related to the mind.\n\nAnd therefore Bhagavan starts this chapter by saying, fix your mind onto me. No matter what amount of knowledge I may have intellectually or how much activity I have performed, but it is the mind which decides what will be my next destination. It is the mind which will have desire to explore new things. So Bhagavan said, attach your mind to me. So we have seen in last few verses, Bhagavan has clarified that focusing your mind into one particular form is the easiest way to do it. That does not mean that Bhagavan is simply saying, idol worship is all that you have to do.\n\nSo we have discussed last time that idol worship is acceptable or not acceptable. It is one form or one means to achieve bhakti. So most of the time when we consider Bhakti simply, he is going to the temple and he sings bhajan. So that's the sum total of bhakti. And Bhagavan said, that's not true. It is your mind, not your activity, going to the temple, it is not singing.\n\nSwamiji used to say bhajans with noisy instruments. He said, that's not Bhakti. Bhakti is where mind penetrates the nature of the Lord and fixes itself to that form. Bhagwan said, first requirement, fix your mind onto me. So your mind and intellect should be firmly established in that supreme knowledge. So we've been learning all throughout this last five chapters.\n\nNothing exists other than his self. What I see through my senses is his lower nature. What I do not see but feel as my own existence, my own consciousness is his higher nature. I cannot vouch for any other person's consciousness, but I can vouch for my own because I Feel I exist, that nobody can take away from me. This consciousness cannot be displayed in any other way other than when I act outside. Then you can say, he's speaking, he's talking, he's alive.\n\nSo that is higher nature. Consciousness which is making this equipment which is inert to function in this world is the higher nature. If you understood these two, then first for focus your mind onto me, constantly think about me does not mean that you have to drop everything and start thinking about him. But whatever you think in the back of your mind, you should think that he is the enabler of this thought. Without his presence, without this consciousness, this mind just cannot even run away in different directions. At least you should have that as a background thought.\n\nJust as in music you have the Shruti playing in the background. Nobody pays attention to the Shruti. But you miss Shruti, then you are done with your Bhajan. So if you attention to the shruti, then the entire music falls in place. Once you miss Shruti, everything is haywire. Our Shruti should be that I am that Satchitananda, this consciousness is me.\n\nBut when we miss that and ignore that, then the music of our life falls apart. Bhagavan said, therefore my Aveshimana and then my intellect Buddhi Nivesha have placed your intellect into me. So now that intellectually we appreciate it, the Bhagavan is everywhere. There is nothing that exists without Bhagavan. Everything I see is Bhagavan alone. Now my intellectual reminds me every time I transact in this world.\n\nThen no matter what I think about, the opposite party which I'm dealing with is nothing but his own representation. And Bhagawan said, if you keep that in mind, you will never be able to do anything wrong. You will not be able to perform any crime. And therefore he says, Nivasyasi Maiyeva Ata Urdham na Sansaya. If you constantly keep this thought in your mind and have your intellect constantly remind you that whatever you are dealing with in this world is nothing but his Prakriti, then you will come to me. You will reside in me.\n\nThere is no doubt about it. So Bhagavan had clearly clarified. The Bhakti is all about mental control. Having their mind focused onto the supreme reality. We find that actually very difficult. Because we all have admitted that controlling mind is not that easy.\n\nSo Bhakti is actually a destination. You start your journey from Karma Yoga. If have no other training in spirituality and somebody says this is the path, then easiest path is Karma Yoga. Because you can control your action with that. When you purify mind and intellect, your intellect becomes ready for knowledge. Then once you get knowledge, you really have to do nothing.\n\nYou don't have to do anything. Bhakti will reveal itself automatically in your mind. It's like when you fell in love. You didn't even realize when you fell in love. You started knowing about her at some point. You didn't realize when you fell in love.\n\nThere is no timeframe you can say on such and such date, I fell in love. I went to a music teacher when I was in my late 40s. And I kept saying Subhashi, I really have trouble understanding what you are saying. I understand it, but I don't feel it. You're telling me you're out of rhythm. But I don't know when I'm out of rhythm.\n\nWhen I stopped going to the class at some point I started understanding it that I'm out of scale, I'm out of rhythm. And when that happened, I cannot pinpoint when the knowledge of scale and rhythm came. There is no timeline for it. But it is because of the music classes I took. This is what is called skill. So Bhagavan said, all you have to do is purify your mind and intellect.\n\nPut your mind and intellect in me and this will happen automatically. Once you achieve Bhakti, as Narad Muni said, it is amruta Swarupa. You will have no fear of death. You will feel Trupta. You will have nothing to achieve anymore in this world. Bhagavan is very kind and said there are alternates.\n\nIf you don't think that is possible for you even after going through last five chapters, then he said, if you are not capable of controlling your mind then just perform Abhyasa Yoga. Abhyasa Yoga is simply to keep reminding yourself that I am deviating from what I have learned and try to bring it back to to. Your goal is Abhyasa Yoga. It's constant practice. But practice makes you perfect. By practice, you can train the wild animals in circus.\n\nSo obviously you can train your mind. If wild animals can be trained, your mind can be trained. That's given it is how much practice you perform. Bhagavan says, just keep practicing. But somebody like me says, Bhagavan, even that's really difficult. Because I get so distracted by my thought that I even forget to remember that I have to bring my mind back where it should be.\n\nAnd Bhagawan has already said in chapter seven that all my duos at Udaraha, they are noble people. No matter what level they are. Udara, Sarvaevethi, they are all good people. They are performing good actions. No matter how incomplete they are. No matter how incapable they are to realizing their own self.\n\nBut they're good people. At whatever level you are, you are at a KG level or at a high school level. But you can start your journey towards your goal. Abhya sahibi sambar tha piya matkarma paramao bhava. Then perform actions for me. But keep in mind that I am doing it for the Lord.\n\nIn a sense that if I have come to realize that there is nothing but the Lord alone. Whoever I serve, I'm serving him. In your profession, when you serve your clients, you keep in mind that the client is nothing but his own representation. You serving him, he's serving the Lord. You serve other people. They are also formed the same Lord.\n\nAnd therefore I'm serving Him. So keep that thought in mind that I am performing all actions for him only. Mother sama, bhi karmani kurvan siddhi mabashe. Even just by performing actions for me, you also can achieve that perfection. So you don't have to meditate. You don't have to do any kind of tapas.\n\nBut if keep performing your actions for me alone. But keep in mind that you're not doing it for yourself. This limited self has to be removed from this equation. Now I want welfare of all beings. But even that is not possible. You are so selfish that you can think about anybody but yourself.\n\nWhat I'm doing is for myself or I am the doer. The ego is so strong. Bhagawan says atha etad API asaktavasi. If you are even incapable of doing so, then kartum udayoga masritah sarvak karma falatyaga. If you cannot perform all actions for me, perform actions for whatever purpose you are performing before. For accomplishing things, achieving things.\n\nGet respect in the society. Your big bank balances, all that is good. Continue doing the same thing you are doing. But give up the anxiety for the fruits.",

Don't judge yourself against this standard—just let it serve as a direction.\n\nWhich quality feels most needed in your life right now? How might you nurture it?

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 12. This is Bhakti Yoga, the Yoga of devotion. And as we had been discussing that Bhagavad Gita is the science of self improvements. So we started out with the first. Section of the Bhagavad Gita to understand who we are and how our body, mind and intellect functions, and how you can get the most effective actions. So that segment ended with meditation.\n\nOnce you understood what is myself and what is not myself, you have to contemplate on it, meditate on it. To move this identification from this limited self which is very natural to us. You consider this is me to that supreme Me, the self which is all pervading. And then we have seen the Lord's nature. Once you identify with the self, what is the nature of that self? What I need to meditate on.\n\nSo the chapter seven through 11, we have seen the nature of that self, that all pervading self and that segment ended in Bhakti Yoga, the Yoga of devotion. The identification with that supreme self is devotion to that supreme self. We have many, many times discussed devotion is love. For divine love is nothing but identification. Identification only comes by finding our common traits, common ground. Our common ground with the supreme self is I want happiness, unlimited happiness, unlimited existence and unlimited bliss.\n\nThis is where I'm looking in my life. Scripture says, the only way you can do it once you identify with that self. So the Bhakti Yoga is the yoga of devotion. How to achieve that identification? We have seen there are two types of way of meditating upon the supreme, either with the form or without the form. And the Bhagavan said, with form is easier for the one who is associated with the body, one who is more attached to this body, this limited ego.\n\nIt's easier to identify with the Lord with the form, whatever form that you and I can assign for our own personal God. And then he says, what is devotion? He said, devotion is the complete surrender of my mind to Him. Right now, my mind is surrendered completely to my ego. My mind and intellect have identified completely with my ego. And therefore I am one with my ego.\n\nMy identity is my ego. And therefore all the limitations of my mind and intellect are now the limitations of myself as identified with the ego. The sorrows which I'm experiencing in life, the unhappiness which I'm experiencing in my life are because of these limitations. My inner self is seeking complete happiness, unending happiness, unbound happiness. But I am identified with my ego. And therefore the limitations of my mind and intellect are creating the unpleasant situations.\n\nSo to get out of this situation, the only way I can achieve that perfect happiness is by identifying with that supreme self, the self which is residing in me, residing in you, residing in him, residing in her. And everything that we perceive, think. Consider as our world and Bhagavan. Therefore, in the last seven verses of this chapter, starting from verse 13 enumerates the qualities of a true devotee. A true Bhakta who has surrendered his or her mind and intellect to the supreme self. So now the mind and intellect have become the instrument of the supreme Self, the Lord we have seen.\n\nIn last two verses we discussed verse 13 and 14 where Bhagavan has enumerated 11 qualities of a true devotee. Where we are saying Advaishta, Sarvabhutana, Maitra, Karuna Yevacha, Nirmama, Nirahankarah, samadu kaksha kakshami. He hates no creature, he is friendly to all beings, he's compassionate, he has no ego, he has no sense of attachment. He is balanced in pleasure and pain. Santustha Satatatam, Yogi, Yatatma, Dhrinisthayaha. He is ever content, steady in meditation about who he is.\n\nHe is self controlled and he possessed firm conviction with mind and intellectual, dedicated to the supreme self. Bhagavan says, such a person is my Bhakta and he is dear to me. Continuing the same description of true devotee Bhagavan Describes in verse 15. Yasmaat na udvijate Lokaha. He by whom the world is not agitated. If my presence makes the world around me agitated, then obviously there is something I need to correct.\n\nWe have experienced this all the time. Some people can just enter the room and suddenly the room will be in a very positive mood, in a very joyful mood. That he will bring that joy, that enthusiasm, that excitement in the room. And some people come in the room and there is a gloom and doom is what we experience. Now we have experienced this or we can feel about this about our day to day acquaintances and friends. But truly we have experienced this in presence of a Mahatma.\n\nI obviously have experienced in presence of Swami Chinmayananda where people used to sit for hours, including myself, without doing anything. Just sitting in front of him and just watching him. And it gives you such a peace in your mind that you just don't want to leave. I tell people that for long time when Swamiji comes, all the devotees will get together. Those who are close to him, who gets a chance to be with him and just be in his room. And Swamiji is doing whatever he's doing.\n\nHe's watching tennis. Because Swamiji used to love watching tennis after lectures. Somebody has taped his Wimbledon or whatever the tournament, and he will be watching that. And other people are just watching Swamiji but feel peace. In a very early days of this exposure to spirituality. My mentor at the time was a chief architect where I used to work as an intern architect.\n\nAfter the first year of architecture school and a vacation, he took me to St. Morta in Surat. And at the time I didn't understand much. But because my chief architect was telling me that you should come with me, I went along with him. And somebody asked Santamurta a question and said, murta, how do we know that a person we are meeting is a sadhu, is a saint, is a true saint or a true sadhu? Because he could be a cheat. He could be just putting up a show and cheating people.\n\nAnd Samatamhurta said, there is only one test for it. If in his presence you feel peace, he is the true sadhu or a sanyasi. If in his presence your mind gets agitated, consider that that person is not a saint or a sadhu at that age. I was only about 17 at the time and I couldn't understand how that can be. But over the years I've experienced that in presence of a Mahatma, a peace prevails in your mind. Automatically he projects his peace into your mind and everyone around him.\n\nSo Bhagavan said, yasmatna udvijate lokaha. He by whom the world is not agitated, his presence bring peace and joy to the people around him and the world around him. We obviously have heard that in presence of Lord Buddha and Sach Mahatma, even the animals will just sit down in front of him and feel peace. Lions and tigers have been calmed by Lord Buddha. So Lokat na udvijate chayaha, neither he agitates the world nor the world can agitate him. As we had seen that in presence of great Mahatmas like Lord Buddha, even the Animals feel peace and they will come down in front of him.\n\nSo this is a test or these are the qualities you find in a true devotee of the Lord. That in his presence you will experience joy. And your agitation in your mind will not affect him. Sometimes everything is going good. But as soon as I come from my office, I create the agitation in the house. Because I bring my agitation from the office to the house.\n\nAnd now my household which was peaceful without me is now agitated because of my presence. Therefore we typically have the threat to our children. Well, you just wait, dad is coming. That means there will be now a turmoil and agitation in the house. So you behave and not add any more agitation to his agitation. So we put a lot of burden on our children to calm down their parents.\n\nObviously I'm joking. So Bhagavan said that my devotee is such a person who brings peace to this world and does not get agitated by this world. Harsh Amarsh, Bhaya, Udvega, Muktaha is free from joy. Harsh Amarsh, envy, Bhaya fear and udvega anxiety. Such a person, Bhagavan says Yah Sacha me priyah. His closer to me does not mean that now Bhagavan is partial to him.\n\nBut he feels the peace prevailing in the supreme self as his peace. And therefore he is closer to him. Continuing in the same vein, the next two verses form the third segment of the qualities of a true devotee. And it says Anapekshaha, Shuchi, dakshaha, Udasinaha, gata, vyatah. So so far in the previous stanza we have seen about 14 characteristics of a true devotee. In this stanza we see six more.\n\nThey say Anapekshaha, he is free from all wants. He has no expectation from this world. Now these are very difficult concepts for you and I to understand. Because we live in a world where expectation and anticipation and performing to the one's expectation. And all these things are a normal part of our vocabulary in the business world, in our regular world we live in. But what we are talking about is my internal world.\n\nWe are not talking about the world outside. And I dealing with the world of my peers and my superiors and my enemies and my competitors. That's the world my ego has created. Now the world we are concerned about is the world for myself, my inner self. For that inner self there is no real enemy or there is no real competitor. Because the same self which is pervading the entire Jagat is also residing in me.\n\nAnd I'm trying to get in contact with that. Once I am in touch with that Bhagavan said, you will have no apeksha. I am satisfied by my own self. And therefore I have no other expectation from the world. Up till now my expectation world will make me happy. My children will grow up and then will do this and they will make me happy.\n\nMy wife will do this and that will make me happy. My friends will do this and that will make me happy. I have mortgaged my happiness with all the people which I know but have not left anything for me to do. So now I have no control over my happiness. I have to rely on the people who mortgage my happiness. So they have to do something to make me happy.\n\nMy children have to perform well in their studies or in their sports or whatever I expect them to do. My wife have to perform according to my desires. My friends have to behave the way I want. When they do that, I'll be happy. So I mortgage my happiness. And therefore I apeksha expectations from the world to make me happy.\n\nBhagavan says my devotee is Anapekshaha. There is no expectation because he is the reservoir of his happiness. Someone who is devoted to the Lord. He cannot be filthy and dirty. Both in his own mind, intellect and also in his surroundings. He will live a clean life both inside and out.\n\nWhen your mind is clean you automatically will make your environment around you clean. It has a reverse effect also. When my environment around me is clean it will calm my mind down and my mind will be clean too. There is no laziness in him.",

      "commentary": " Shri Purohit Swami did not comment on this sloka\n\nWhat is my purpose and destiny? We have been discussing chapter 12, Bhakti Yoga, Yoga of Devotion. The first six chapters described Karma Yoga or taught us Karma Yoga, the Yoga of action, who we are as individuals and how our actions function and how we can make our actions more efficient. We have seen two definitions of Yoga, Samatvam Yoga Ucha there, then we also send Yoga Karma Sukhav Salam. The equanimity of mind is Yoga. And also the dexterity in action is Yoga.\n\nYou can only be dexterous in your actions if your mind is quiet. So that was the technique we learned in first six chapters. And then in the end of those chapters we had Dhyana Yoga, Yoga of Meditation. Bhagawan said, I consider Yogi to be higher than even a Gnani, even Tapasvi. So therefore he said, you become Yogi Arjuna. He said, how do I become Yogi?\n\nHe said, you offer your mind and intellect to me, focus your mind and intellect to me, synchronize your mind and intellect to me, and you become a Yogi. Bhagavan has defined a perfect Bhakta. Bhagavan defined his devotee as the one who offers his mind and intellect and considers him to be the supreme goal. Now here we discussed that Bhagavan, the supreme self which is pervading everywhere, is the same self as you consider yourself. Right now I consider myself to be identified with this body, mind and intellectual. Bhagawan said, when you tune your mind and intellect to me and align with me and identify with me, you become my Bhakta.\n\nSo that's the definition of bhakta we learn up front in this chapter. Mai Arpit Manobuddhe, one who has offered his mind and intellect to me. Swamiji used to joke about it that in all our temples, the Bhagavans are standing there with the hand extended, hoping that some Bhakta will come someday and offer his mind and intellect to me. I'll fix it and give it back to him. But he says they're all unemployed. When no Bhakta ever goes to offer his mind and intellect.\n\nThey go and offer them coconuts and flowers and prasads, but nobody interested in giving their mind or intellect to Bhagavan. So Bhagavan has defined in this chapter, the devotee is the one whose mind is fixed on him and his intellect is aligned with him. We started this chapter with Arjuna's question the two types of Bhaktas. One who consider God to be manifested in a particular form and worshipping him as his goal, and one who considers God to be Nirakar without any attributes, only all pervading. Which one is better, which one is closer to him? And Bhagawan said, both are closer to me.\n\nBut for somebody who considers himself to be embodied, who identifies with his body as him, for him, it is very difficult to focus on God without any attributes. Therefore, it is much easier for you, Arjuna, to focus on someone or something you consider as the representation of the supreme reality. In this case, Bhagavan said, krishna as me, if you focus on me as the representation of the supreme reality. So you basically say the entire divinity in that person. Swamiji explains, just as we see my entire patriotic feelings are assigned to the flag of my country. When that flag is raised in that stadium in the time of Olympics medal giving, all the citizens of that country feel elated because that flag represents their identification with their country.\n\nBhagwan said, in the same way, when you can identify in one person, in one thing, the entire supreme reality, then it is easier for you to worship that one. Then Bhagawan has given us choices that if you cannot offer your mind and intellect to me, at least do Abhyasa. There are two ways to interpret. One is to constantly trying to offer your mind an intellect to Bhagawan or other is to learn about the nature of God through the Scripturesan. Then that you come to realize what is the supreme reality is and then offer yourself to it. You see, if that is not possible, offer all your actions to me that you are working for me.\n\nSurrender to me, and then I'll take care of everything. It's like when you work for a large company. Whatever you do in your position, you're actually doing it for the company. When you go for a meeting with your client, you don't say I am such and such. You say I represent such and such company. The whole entire power of that company is behind you.\n\nNobody knows better than me because I used to work for large companies. The last firm I used to work had 2100 people. So when I represent myself and Sam from Dubai and Davis, they obviously know that I represent 2100 people firm. When I left that firm and started my own firm, I had five people. When I go and say I'm NBG Architecture, first I have to explain what NBG Architecture is, who owns it and how it came into existence. Then I say I'm the same person used to meet.\n\nBecause the power of that company is what you're representing. Larger the company, the larger power you have. So if you identify with this limited mind and intellect, you're projecting the limited power of this mind and intellect. But if you identify with that universal mind and intellect, then when you work in this world outside, you're projecting the power of the supreme in this world. The Bhagavan said, do all your actions for me, consider me as your employer and then work in this world. And you will have the supreme power behind you to be successful in everything you do.\n\nThere's even that is not possible. Then give up the anxiety for the fruits of your actions. The Karma Falada, the Prakriti that will give you peace instantaneously. All those things may not give you peace instantaneously. But this one thing, if you give up the anxiety for the fruits of actions will give you peace instantaneously. No Achiraat right away you will get this peace.\n\nSo therefore Bhagavan in the end said Karma filth Yaga is the greatest devotion to me. In other words, you have given up the sense of ownership that I am the doer and I control my destiny. Once you have given up that all your anxiety will be gone and then you will be aligned with me. So but once he is my greatest devotee who gives up the anxiety for the fruits of actions. In the last few verses, Bhagavan has been defining perfect devotee perfect bhakta. From verses 13 onwards till verse 19, Bhagavan is defining a perfect devotee.\n\nThese qualities described for a perfect devotee are no different than the Muni we have seen in chapter two. The qualities are exactly same. They are presented in a different way. But they are exactly the same qualities which we are learning when Bhagavan consider such a person as his Bhakta. And Swamiji categorized these qualities into six categories. So after every other, every verse, Bhagavan said Samay Priyaha, such a devotee is closer to me, is dear to me.\n\nWhen you say dear to me, Bhagavan is not partial that if you have this quality. And if you don't have this quality, I don't like you. But that person is identifying much closer the qualities which we have been seeing from verse 13 onward. It says that Adhvista Sarvabhutanam Maitra Karunayevacha, he does not hate anyone in this world. Now that is something we find it very difficult for us to do because we hate many things and many beings in this world. I hate cockroaches and I hate snakes.\n\nBhagawan said, you may not want to associate with them, you may want to stay away from them, but you do not hate them. It's not like Parasuram is, I'm going to go and make this earth. Nakshatri means no Kshatriyas on this planet. I'm not going to go and say I'll make this earth without any cockroaches because they have survived the longest. As we know, we will be gone, but they will be there. The Bhagawan said, one who is not hating anyone, then we have seen several qualities.\n\nAnd then we are coming to the verse. Yasmatna dwijate Lokaha. This is a very important verse, Lokatna Dvijatechayaha. One who is not disturbed by others, he is not disturbing the world outside. My behavior, my presence should not agitate others and nor should I be agitated by others. I used to work for the company.\n\nI had moved from Dallas from another company, wzmh. They gave me a project and said there was already a project manager. But they said they were looking for replacement. So they gave me that project. I went to the first meeting and the contractor said, neil, I'm glad that now you are going to be the project manager. The last project manager we have a guy named Howard Johnson.\n\nHe said he may not say anything, he may not do anything, but as he walks into the room, everybody will be tense and agitated. It's somehow the way he handled people, it just didn't make people comfortable. They say, you shouldn't be that type of a person. People should calm and comfortable in your presence. I remember one incident. My chief architect where I was interning in first years, architecture student who introduced me to Swami Chinmayanda.\n\nHe took me to another Sant Mota. He somehow was on a mission to introduce me to all great sages. And I kept telling him, padna, I have no interest in spirituality. But anyway, he introduced me to Sant Mota. He Founded this Moun Mandira. His concept was that you stay alone in a room as long as you can.\n\nSo people sign up for one day, two days, one week, one month. And the condition was that you just go there, do whatever you want to do. You chant, you read Bhagavad Gita, read even novel if you want to. But you are not connected with the world outside. No phones, no newspapers. Take what are the books you want to take.\n\nBut other than that you stay there. People used to come from all over the world to sign up for that Mount Mandir. I'm not sure whether it's still there or not. But he was called Sant Mota when Padya took me to him. Somebody asked Muta a question and I was only 17 years old. I hear all about some are fake sadhus who are genuine teachers.\n\nHow do we differentiate? Because we don't know how to differentiate between a fake guru and a real guru. What I say is very simple. If you come to that person and if you feel peace in your mind, he is the right Sadhu. In his presence you get agitated. Consider him to be not good for you.\n\nI still remember that answer after all these years. And it is such a profound statement. Because I'll tell you what we have experienced ourselves in presence of Gurudev. No matter as many questions and as you went then I'm going to talk to Swamiji and tell him that these people are doing this to me and all that. You go there, you forget everything. You forgot what you were going to go and complain or even your own.\n\nPeople used to just sit in front of Swamiji for hours. Swamiji keeps doing whatever he was doing. He was actually in those days watching. Swamiji always liked to watch tennis because he was a tennis player. So people will record all those Wimbledon matches and all that. And when Swamiji is relaxing, he will watch tennis.\n\nWe will have like 15, 20 people just sitting there for hours without any words exchanged.",

      "commentary": "What is my purpose and destiny? We've been discussing chapter 12, Bhakti Yoga. Devotion is love for the Divine. Love is nothing but identification. When we identify with someone more, we identify more. We like that person more.\n\nWhen identification becomes complete, we say we fell in love with that person. So Bhakti is nothing but the love for the Divine. The love cannot occur without knowledge of that person or knowledge of that thing. So in this case, loving God is not possible without knowing God. So knowledge is as important as my desire to love God. So the knowledge about God or knowledge about the Supreme Being is what we had been learning from Bhagavan.\n\nIn last five chapters. From chapter 7 through 11, Bhagavan elaborated what is the nature of the Supreme. In chapter seven he says, there is nothing greater than Me. And then he has explained that everything that you see is nothing but me. That the Prakriti you see is nothing but my lower Prakriti, my lower nature which is manifest Prakriti. So he has described his lower Prakriti as the manifest world which we see.\n\nWe complain that we have not seen Bhagavan. But Bhagavan said, you see me every day. You deal with me every day. You just do not know that you are dealing with Bhagavan because there is nothing other than me in this world. Then he had described many aspects of this Prakriti. How we can identify his presence in Prakriti which we have seen in chapter 10 in Vibhuti Yoga that anything which you see which is excellent in this world, consider that to be my presence.\n\nI am the strength in strong and the intelligence in intellect. I am the fragrance in flower. Everything that right now I consider is something other than me. Bhagavan said, it is me, the supreme alone. So right now my identification is so complete with this limited self that I am. I consider this body, mind and intellect is me.\n\nSo this identity is so complete they allow myself. Loving myself is very easy. In spite of all my shortcoming that I am aware of, I Never hate myself, because the identification is so complete that I'm in love with myself. But once again, the quest in life is to change this identification from this limited self to the supreme self. For that to happen, I obviously didn't know Bhagavan. As we have seen in last five chapters, Bhagavan has been telling us what is the nature of the supreme.\n\nIn chapter 11, before this chapter, we have seen that Bhagavan has demonstrated that everything comes out of me and everything is merging into me, whether you consider good, bad or ugly. Because it's very easy for us to associate divinity with something which is very pristine and sattvic. But it's very difficult for our mind to associate divinity with something which does not work with me, which is not conducive to me. Therefore, in this chapter, when Bhagavan explaining Bhakti describes the nature of the perfect devotee. From the beginning of this chapter we have seen Arjuna's question, which is better? One who worships this manifest Prakriti, the manifest nature of the God, those who worship supreme without any attributes.\n\nBecause in the end we have learned that he does not have any form. He is not a man, he is not a woman, he is not it, he is not she, he is not he, he's everything. So without any form, it is very difficult for us to grasp his nature. That higher Prakriti of mind, Bhagawan said, is very different than the manifest Prakriti which you see. But to focus on that higher Prakriti, my mind may not be capable of. The Bhagavan said, for those who consider them to be identified with this body, the embodied ones who consider this is me.\n\nAs we said we, our identity is so complete with this body, mind, intellect. Nobody is to tell me that this is me or that's me and this is not me. Rest is the world outside. It's a one who considers that for him to focus his mind on unmanifest is very difficult. Klesa, Adhiktara, Tesha. For them the difficulty is much greater.\n\nSo for them it is easier to focus on one form which you find Divine Ramakrishna or Gurudeh Swami Chinmayanda in his presence, you don't have to figure out what the God looks like. Many children in our neighborhood, when Sadhguru Deva came to our house, the God came to Bhatt's house. Because we associate the divinity with God, Bhagawan said, this may be easier for you, Arjuna, at your level the easiest way for you to worship me is give your mind and intellect to me. In other words, synchronize your mind and intellect with me. As we have discussed last time, wwkd, what would Krishna do in this situation? The Christian bracelets called wwjd.\n\nIt's for teenagers who are facing this peer pressure and see should I smoke or not smoke? You say, Think about it. Look at the breast lights in wwjd. What would Jesus do in this case? Synchronize your mind and intellect with me. Give your mind and intellect to me and make me supreme goal.\n\nI'll take care of myself. If that is not possible, Bhagawan gives another option. Constant practice or constant learning of the nature of Lord from the scriptures. If that is not possible, give me all your actions, work for me and do all your actions for me. My employer is Lord Krishna. Everything I do is for him.\n\nBecause even that is not possible. Then just do Karma Falath Yaga. Don't expect anything from what you do. In the end he said, Karma Falath Yaga is the greatest of all because it gives you peace instantaneously. As soon as you give up the anxiety for the fruits of actions, your mind will stop agitating about it. Most of my agitations about the fruits fear of what will happen in future.\n\nBhagawan said, once you give up, that peace will come automatically. Therefore it is greater than anything. So Bhakti is like a hov lane on highway. It takes you to your destination much quicker than other paths. Karma yoga, Nana yoga, Dhyana yoga. Those are slower paths.\n\nMargaret, there are several entry points you can have. Either you are ready and give your mind to me. If you're not ready, keep practicing. If not, keep working for me. If not, just give up fruits of actions and you will be my Bhakta. And then in last few _Verses_ Starting from verse 13, we've seen the nature or the characteristics or qualities of a perfect devotee.\n\nAll our preconceived notion about a bhakta, that he has given up everything and he is just doing nothing but bhajans all day long. And as Swamiji used to say, with those noisy accompaniment, he said, no, that's not bhakti. Bhakta is the one who has these qualities. So Bhagawan has given the litmus test of who is a perfect devotee. And Swamiji enumerates 36 qualities of a perfect devotee starting From Adwaishtaha Sarvabhuta Ram Maitra Karunayevacha. One who does not hate anyone.\n\nAs I said, it is so difficult for us to even have that concept. Because so many things we don't like in this world we have seen. As long as you have the identification with this bodyman, intellect within the realm of this body, realm of this mind, realm of this intellect. And therefore anything which is not conducive to the body, I'll hate. It's too hot, it's too cold, you know, because it's not conducive to my body. When I used to live in Nairobi, you don't need air conditioning, you don't need heating.\n\nBecause city by nature is perfectly air conditioned. The temperature remains between 65 and 75 all throughout the year. So I find that very conducive. Good city to live in. Till we found out that Meena and my son Neeraj both had asthma because of the high altitude. So now for me it is very conducive.\n\nFor them it is completely not conducive. So Bhagawan says, as long as you identify this body, mind and intellect. There is something which is mentally conducive. Sometimes mentally not conducive, intellectually conducive, intellectually not conducive. But one who is not identified with this, for him it is okay to worship the God without any form. But in true Bhakta reaches that point.\n\nSo we have been seeing these qualities from last few _Verses_. Sama satra uchamitrecha tatham mana apamana yoho sita ushna sukha dukeshu sama sanga vivarjitah. One who is not now considering this body, my intellect to be me, but my equipment. For him, his relationships are very neutral in all aspects. Nobody is my friend and nobody is my foe. But there is a Vyavaharik relationship I will have.\n\nThe people who help me are my friends. The people who hinder me are my enemies, not my. But that's a Vyavaharik relationship. But the core of my being. I remain equanimous to them. As long as I identify with my mind, there will be honor and dishonor.\n\nObviously we architects put out our buildings for all to see. They saying that doctors bury their mistakes. We put out for the world to see. And I avoid passing by those buildings, the ones which I like. I make sure that I pass by that building because that's intellectual level. Honor and dishonor is what I perceive.\n\nBut you see the True bhakta. For him, both are equal. Sita, ushna, Sukha, Dukhyadeshu and the body level, hot and cold. That does not mean that I don't feel hot. Somebody asked Swamiji Gurudev, why do I always say that you go in the best car? Because people go to pick up Swamiji at the airport.\n\nSomebody's a Mercedes or BMW or Lexus. There are people who have Toyotas. You don't go in those cars. Swamiji said, I'm not stupid. If there is best car available, which is more reliable, it is not going to break down on the way. Why should I take a chance and go in an old Subaru with my breakdown highway?\n\nSo when it is available to me to mitigate the discomfort I have at the bottom, I will do it. But if it is not available, I persevere and continue. Sita ushna, sukhaduka, agama apa. You know, Anityaha, they come and go. I remain constantly at peace because Samaha, sangha, vivarjitah. I remain constant, constantly in the state of bliss or equanimity because I'm not attached to any of these worlds of mine.\n\nPhysical, mental, intellectual. Tulya nindah tuthi mauni tulya Nindahast is equanimous to criticism and praise. Because no matter what you do, somebody will praise the same act and somebody will hate that act. Supreme Court took a decision on those abortion pills. Democrats are rejoicing. They did the right thing.\n\nRepublicans are saying, what is this court doing? So Ninda and Stuti both I consider to be not my doing, but their mental environment. Somebody will like what I say because it is conducive to him or her. Somebody will criticize what I say because it is not conducive to them. So therefore, a true devotee of the Lord, in other words, one who has identified himself with the supreme, he remains okay in all situations, Mauni. He becomes silent, not just physically or at the speech level.\n\nAt the mind level, I may be silent, but fuming inside. And that's very dangerous. You can end up in mental asylum if you don't vocalize your anger. You don't vocalize your ideas. You don't vocalize what's going on in your mind. But this silence at the mind level.\n\nWhen Mouni, the true devotee, becomes silent. Santusta eena kena chit is content with this or that.",
      "reflection": "Consider the qualities of the ideal devotee described in this chapter: free from ego, equal toward friend and foe, steady in all circumstances. Don't judge yourself against this standard—just let it serve as a direction.\n\nWhich quality feels most needed in your life right now? How might you nurture it? The path of devotion isn't about achieving perfection but about orienting the heart toward what is highest.\n\nNotice the moments today when you feel most connected to something greater than yourself. What conditions support that connection? How might you cultivate them?"

      "commentary": "We concluded chapter 12, Bhakti Yoga Yoga of Devotion. Now we'll be starting Discussion on Chapter 13, the Kshatrakshatragna Vibhaga Yoga Yoga of differentiation between the field and its knower. So far we have seen the two segments of the Bhagavad Gita which discussed DHA and that from the Mahavakya Tattvamasi. First six chapters we learned about Dao, Next six chapters we learned about that. Now we will be discussing about the correlative verb asi, the connections between the two and how to differentiate between the two. Therefore it's called Kshetra Kshatragna Vibhaga Yoga Yoga of the field and its knower.\n\nIn other words, how to differentiate between what I am not and what I am. There is a granth written by Bhagavan Shankaracharya or at least attributed to him called Drishya Viveka, which is similar in nature but more logically explained. Drek Drasya Viveka, discrimination between the seer and the seeing. Who is the seer and what is seen? If we can differentiate then we know the both. So the same way here it says Kshatrakshatragna Vibhaga how to differentiate the fuel from its knower.\n\nSo that's the theme of this chapter. In other words, we will be learning how to navigate through Maya. Maya is the entity which creates this confusion for me, who I am and what is my real nature. Maya creates this illusion of plurality where the only singularity exists. One exists, but it appears to be many. So the chapter now discusses this aspect of Maya in detail.\n\nSwamiji explains here that this chapter suddenly after devotion, Krishna took up a theme which is completely different and therefore some interpolar has added this one verse. The very first verse, Arjuna Vacha, which seemed to be not there in previous commentators commentary such as Bhagavan Sankaracharya, he did not comment on the first verse Arjuna Vacha. He starts from the second verse, same as Naneswari starts also from the second verse. Not the first Sri Bhagavan, not from Arjunaja but because it is a subject which seemed like suddenly Bhagavan has taken up a different topic. Somebody thought it is appropriate to add a connector between what we have discussed so far and what we'll be discussing. So what we will be discussing is actually the continuation of the theme.\n\nBhagavan started in chapter seven and chapter eight. In chapter seven he talked about the Eightfold Lower Prakriti and the Manifest Prakriti. And then in chapter eight he talked imperishable Brahman. And then chapter nine, 10, 11 was somewhat of a distraction from the theme because Arjuna kept asking question. He wanted to know in what different forms to be thought about Bhagavan. So he gave the Vibhuti Yoga.\n\nThen he wanted to know the Bhagavan in its totality to give him the Vishwarupadarshan. And then obviously it culminated in Bhakti Yoga. So Bhagavan picked up that theme again from chapter 7 8. In chapter 13 we want to continue the theme of how to differentiate between the Jiva and Paramatma and what is their connection. So as we have learnt in that great statement that thou art that which you are seeking and you who consider who you are are one and the same. But right now I don't see the connection.\n\nOnce I know the nature of both then I will be able to connect them both. So that's basically the theme of the chapter 13, Kshitrakshatragna Vig Yoga. The very first verse Arjuna Vacha basically gives you what we're going to discuss in this chapter. So as we've discussed many times, best presentation is when you go and tell them what we're going to talk about. You know, tell them what we are talking about and then tell them what you told them. This is what we discussed.\n\nSummarize it, put an agenda up front, make the presentation and then summarize. So here the first verse which was attributed to Arjuna, it says Prakrutim Purusamcha Eva Kshetra Kshatragnam Eva Cha etat veditum ichami Gnanam Gnayam Chakishava. These are the things I want to understand clearly. So we pick up the themes from 7 and 8 chapter Prakrutin Purusha I want to know Prakrutin Purusham. We have discussed before, we need to brush up our knowledge what is Prakriti and Purusha and also Kshatra Nakshatra Gna, the field and its Knower, you talked about the field of my actions. This world currently is clear to me that this is the field of my actions.\n\nFor me it is very simple. I am the actor and this world is the field of my actions. So I am the knower of the field of my actions. But when it comes to knowing who I am, I have to go further down there. So we will talk about that. Kshatrakshatragnam evacha e titit vedutu mi cham I gnanam gneam cha KE So I also want to know what is knowledge and what is to be known.\n\nSo we clarified by this first verse what we'll be discussing. To know myself, I have to be very clear about what is Prakriti and what is Purusha, what is manifested, what is unmanifest. I also need to know what is the field of my activity, who is the actor. Also I want to know what is knowledge and what is to be known. Just simple curiosity. I want to know doesn't mean anything.\n\nI need to know what is there to be known. So Arjuna asked this question to put the agenda forward for this chapter saying we want to know about these things. So the next verse where it changes the paradigm for us. Idam sariram konteya Kshatram ITI abhidhiyate. This body or kantea is called the field. Completely different than what I thought all along.\n\nWe thought that this world is the field. And I as this limited being is the knower of this world. I, I know my world, I know my field, my field of my profession, field of my activity. So right now I have considered this body to be the knower, this me, this limited being to be me. The knower Bhagwan said, no, this body itself is the field. This field which I consider to be the world and this body, mind, intellect to be me.\n\nHe said, no, this body belongs to the field, the Prakriti. You then knower is somebody different than that. This body is called the field. He who knows is called the Kshatragna. One who knows this body is the Kshatragna. Once I have established what the field is, who knows the field is the knower.\n\nSo from the perspective of the world, the I is the one which is the seer of this world. When I see the colors and forms, my eye is the seer, the world is the seer. When it comes to my eye, the mind is the seer and I is the seeing. When I see and say what is happening to my eye, who is seeing my mind is seeing my eye. So I took a step backward and put the seer in the field of the sea. And if I keep receding, then everything that I consider today to be me will belong to the field of Prakriti.\n\nThat which I consider to be me so far is my mind, my body, my intellect. That's what I define myself to be. But when seen from the perspective of what do I know, I know about my body. If I know my body, then I am the the knower. Somebody other than my body. Same goes for my mind.\n\nI'm very aware that my mind is upset. So I am the knower of my mind. My mind is not, you know, calm today. Somebody who sees the mind to be not calm or calm. There is some other entity which is seeing the mind. That some other entities also can judge whether my intellect is sharp or dull.\n\nI don't know about it. So there is somebody other than this body, mind and intellect who is the knower. One who knows all these three. So in short, Ibhagavan says the body is the field. The one who knows that is considered to be the knower. That's basically simple.\n\nBut because of my identification, I always considered this to be the seer. As I give the example that my eye can see but only with the aid of my glasses. So I consider the glasses to be as important as my eye. If I want to read without glasses, I cannot read. So glasses are as important for me to read as my eye is. But I don't consider my eye and glasses in the same category.\n\nBecause I know I can go to Lens Crafter and get replacement glass in one hour. I least today, is not that easy to replace. Someday it will be probably as simple. Till that time, I consider eye to be something very special. I consider _part of me without which I cannot see. But glasses I can replace.\n\nBut if I can now learn that even I can be replaced anytime, then I will also put the eye in the same category as my glasses are. So sometimes through which we see, we identify so closely that we forget the differentiation between the seer and seen. So Bhagawan changes this paradigm and says this body is the field through which the seer is functioning to manifest. Electricity needs all these lamps and gadgets. Electricity is present in this room when we can vouch for it. Because the lights are on, the air conditioning is on.\n\nBut you remove both air conditioning and the light. We will not know whether the electricity is in the room or not until you put finger in that outlet. So the seer is present, but its presence is felt through the equipment. Knower is only there as long as the knowables are there. If there's nothing to be known, the knower is not needed. The proverbial saying, whether a tree falling in jungle makes a sound or not, unless there's somebody to listen to that sound, the world of sound does not exist.\n\nAnd unless there are objects, no knower can exist. In my deep sleep, there is no knower because the world does not exist for me. Therefore there is no knower. If there is no knowables, the knower does not exist. So if you remove the knowables from the knower, Bhagwan says, what remains is pure knowledge, not knowledge of what it is, knowledge by itself, which we call it pure awareness. That's pure awareness.\n\nRight now I exist as. Then everything else follows within. As Neil Butt, as an architect, as a father, as a community member, whatever it is. But I have to attach something to it as I exist. And if you remove all of them, what remain is I exist. So the knower and the known go together.\n\nSo it says, idham saryam kaunteya Kshatramiti vidhiyate. This body is to be known as the field, and the one who knows the body is the knower of the field. Now these are the arguments for us to navigate through Maya so that you can contemplate on what is the nature of the self. So now you can start to contemplate saying, okay, if this body is not me, who knows this body? So next verse says, kshetragnam chapimamviddy sarvakshetreshu bharat. Once we have discussed that this body is the field and the knower is the Kshatragna, then we may have one another confusion that in my body I am the field and my consciousness is the knower.\n\nIn your body, the same thing for you. There are so many knowers in this world, as many beings are there that many knowers are there from our perspective from just learning the second verse. So Bhagavan clarifies this.",
      "reflection": "Today, practice distinguishing the field from the knower of the field. When emotions arise, notice: 'This is happening in the field, and I am aware of it.' When thoughts arise, the same.\n\nYou are not your thoughts, not your emotions, not your body. You are that which is aware of all these. This simple shift in identification—from the observed to the observer—is the beginning of liberation.\n\nPay attention to the moments when you forget this distinction and get lost in experience. Can you notice the moment of forgetting? The moment of remembering?"

      "commentary": "So we have started discussing chapter 13, Shatrakshatragna Vibhaga Yoga, Yoga of knowing the difference between the field and its knower. So we are basically learning how to navigate through Maya. So as we have seen before, we have four great Vedas, Rick, Saam, Yajur and Atharva. Each one gave us one great statement which summarizes the entire philosophy of who I am, the end of the Vedas, a section called Vedanta, literally end of Vedas, which consists of Upanishads. Upanishads discuss about who we are, what's our relationship to that Almighty, and whether I have an existence before and after my death. So each one has argued this point logically and came to a logical conclusion what the truth is, and that is summarizing one great statement in each Veda.\n\nSo in Rugveda from Ayutary Upanishad, we get Prajnaam Brahman. In the end, he says, the real truth is that the consciousness alone is that Almighty, all pervading self. From this Sama Veda in Chandogya Upanishad came Tattvamasi, that thou art, you are that that which you are seeking as the Supreme Lord is your own self. From the Atharva Veda came I am Atma Brahman. After the inquiry about what the self is, it says, my self is Brahman. The self which I consider to be myself is Brahman.\n\nSo that comes from Authoritya Mandukya Upanishadha. The last one is aham, Brahmasmi, I am Brahman. The final realization that Brahman is none other than my own self comes from the Yajurveda, from Bhradharanyaka Upanishad Gita, as we have seen, is Bhagavan. Krishna has collected all those ideas from Upanishads and put in one discourse called Bhagavad Gita. So we had been discussing Bhagavad Gita. We are learning the essence of these great statements.\n\nAnd many commentators have said, as we have discussed, many, many, many Times before that. Tattvamasi is the statement which Gita elaborates upon. So we have learned so far about Dhat and Dao in first 12 chapters. For six chapters we learn about Dao, that is you and I as limited beings. And that segment culminated in Dhyana Yoga, Yoga of Meditation. Once I know who I am as a limited being, now I have to contemplate upon who I am.\n\nThe next six chapters we discussed about that, that Almighty, the Supreme. What is the nature of that? And that culminated into Bhakti Yoga, Yoga of devotion. Once I know myself in that Almighty, I will have nothing but devotion for that self. Once I identify with someone, I will be in love with that person. I love something when I know something.\n\nOnce I know the nature of the supreme, then only I can develop devotion for it. So chapter 12 was Bhakti yoga, yoga of devotion. Chapter 13 now connects the two. So that thou art that correlative verb art is, is what we had been discussing how to make the connection between this limited self which I consider to be myself to that which is Almighty, all pervading. So as we have discussed in Self Unfoldment and before that, this self which I consider is a conditioned self, conditioned in my body. And I consider this is my body.\n\nThis is a gross body which I consider to be my body which is perceived by everybody else. Everybody can see how tall I am, how short I am, how old I am. But then there is a subtle body which I am very aware. You may have inkling about it, but you can't perceive it. That's my mind and intellect. That's like a software in this hardware called body.\n\nBut both of these are in existence because of the third body which is called causal body which is the cause for these two to come into existence. These two cannot come into existence if there is no cause for it. These two came into existence as they are. Why you are not so so powerful, why you are not so smart. He said that's because this is what that cause considered the most appropriate form to transact all the desires and vasanas which I have. So that's causal body.\n\nThe causal body is nothing but the leftover tendencies in vasanas from my past experience experiences from my past experience of buying a house in this area. If I made mistake last time, don't do that again. Next time when I buy the house I look for, well, let's find a good school district because that's what is more important. Let's find which has Best resale value. Now that's more important. Don't fall into the trap of this is the most economical area.\n\nYou need to find something where the resale value is more important. All these are my past impressions of last time, which I made mistake. So the same way Bhagavan says that this body and this mind is also ordered by me, custom designed by me. Like you online and fill out which color car you want and then what shape, what size and what brand and you put together a customized package. I heard somewhere that at Starbucks, the combination of coffee like 5,400 and something that many different varieties of coffee you can order at Starbucks so you can customize your coffee. It's the same way I have customized this existence of mind which I call my limited self.\n\nTotal impressions of my past experiences and tendencies created these two bodies. Subtle body and gross body. That's at my micro level. The total tendencies and impressions of all the beings and things in this Jagat, this universe create the total causal body. And in Sankhya philosophy it's called Mola Prakriti. The original nature of this Prakriti, Mula Prakriti.\n\nIn Vedanta, we call it Maya. That means Yama Samaya. That which is not, but appears to be, that is Maya. These limitations on me as my body, my mind, my intellect are not there. Actually there is no limitations on myself of my mind, my intellect, my body. But it appears to have this limitation.\n\nI feel these limitations when I think about myself. That's because of Maya. Then Maya is nothing but my identification with this body, with this mind, with this intellect. As long as they are there, all the limitations of my body, mind and intellect will be there. Once I get out of that identification, those limitations only remain for the body, for the mind, for the intellect, but not for me. Swami Viranda used to say, I as a Swami has all the problems.\n\nBut I as I has no problem. I as an architect has all the problems, all limitations. But when I remove all those, the I which remains has no problem because it has no limitation. So how to migrate from this limited I and identification to that unlimited I is. Now we'll be discussing from chapter 13 through 18. And therefore the last chapter, chapter 18 will culminate into Moksas and Yoga of liberation to renunciation.\n\nSo we started discussing chapter 13. And we have indicated that the very first verse, Arjuna Vacha, is not in many texts. But it very appropriate that it is interpolated by some commentator. Arjuna said I want to know the nature of these things. What are the things you want to Prakruti? I want to know the nature of Prakriti.\n\nI want to know the nature of Purush also. In addition I want to know Kshetra, Kshatra Gna what is the field and who is the knower of the field. I want to know what is knowledge and what is to be known. So these are the topics we'll be discussing going forward. Somebody put in Arjuna's mouth so that we know. We'll be talking about Purusha and Prakriti, Kshatrakshatragna, Gnanam Ganeyam.\n\nIf I can differentiate between these two, what is Chetranshetraguna? What is Purusha and Prakriti? What is knowledge and know about? Then I have accomplished my task. So from the next verse Bhagavan basically changes the paradigm for us. Up till now I considered the I the knower and the world is the field of my actions.\n\nSo I've included in I the knower. My body, my mind, my intellect is the knower part. Neel, do you know this? When I say I know it I mean my mind, my intellect, my body are included in it. But once I know Idam Shariram, Kaunteya Yakshetram Ithiyabhidhiyate. You want to know what the field is?\n\nThis body is the field. One who knows this field is the knower of the field. So this body is the field of activities for the consciousness to function through. But it is not I this is the field. So in this field all the activities take place. So this field is nothing but part of the Prakriti.\n\nI have borrowed from the Prakriti this body. All the food which I have eaten from this day of my birth till this morning breakfast is my body. So I actually borrowed from outside. So Bhagavan said this is filled. One who knows this field say I am aware of my body. I'm aware my leg is broken.\n\nI'm aware I'm short, I'm aware I'm tall. That entity which is aware of the limitations or the quality of the body, Bhagavan said he is the knower. So he defines what is Kshetranshetragna. But he included this body in the field. So body is part of the Prakriti so is mind, so is intellect. They do not belong to me.\n\nThey are the equipment borrowed from this Prakriti and I use them. Then Kshetragnam Chapimam Vidhi Sarvakshatriya Subharat. I the knower of this body is a very distinct and individual. Then you, the knower of your body sees the knower of her body. Bhagawan says no, only there is one knower. He knows all the bodies.\n\nAll the fields of actions is known by only one entity. Bhagawan says that's me. Kshatragna is only one. Kshetra may be many, the field of activities may be many. But the knower and the actor is only one. Be clear that I'm the only knower in this world.\n\nI the all pervading self is the only knower. And then the next verse, verse 4 says Tatkhetramcha yatcha Yadrukcha Yadvikh Tatsamase. Once again he told us what we are going to be discussing and then we'll be discussing. Then in the end we'll say this is what we discussed. So this is what we're going to discuss. What is the field and what is its nature?\n\nWhat are its modifications? Because sometimes we don't recognize the thing which gets modified. We may know it's in a raw form but when modified we don't recognize. So you should also know the modification of Bhagavan and when it is and also who it is and what his powers are. So he basically said we'll be discussing this. What is the nature of the field?\n\nWhat are its modifications, where it is, how it functions, what are the field's powers? So we are talking Maya. What is Maya's powers are how it deludes you into thinking who you are not is what Bhagavan said. I'll be telling you in a brief, so please listen from me. Rusihi Bahudaha Gitam Chando ABHI vivihi Pruthak Brahma Sutra Padehi cha Eva Hetu Madbihi Vinish Chittai he even Bhagawan Krishna. I cannot say that this is my own idea.\n\nIn our culture there is nothing called original idea even for an idea. Who Bhagavan is you cannot say this is my idea has to be validated by many seers before you. And many people must have attested that this is the truth. Then only that truth is validated. Our culture is Veda bound culture. So we have to have the proof of the idea which we are propagating or promoting.\n\nHas to have proof in Vedas. So Bhagawan Krishna said, I'm not going to tell you anything new.",
      "reflection": "Today, practice distinguishing the field from the knower of the field. When emotions arise, notice: 'This is happening in the field, and I am aware of it.' When thoughts arise, the same.\n\nYou are not your thoughts, not your emotions, not your body. You are that which is aware of all these. This simple shift in identification—from the observed to the observer—is the beginning of liberation.\n\nPay attention to the moments when you forget this distinction and get lost in experience. Can you notice the moment of forgetting? The moment of remembering?"

      "commentary": "So we have started discussing chapter 13, Shatrakshatragna Vibhaga Yoga, Yoga of knowing the difference between the field and its knower. So we are basically learning how to navigate through Maya. So as we have seen before, we have four great Vedas, Rick, Saam, Yajur and Atharva. Each one gave us one great statement which summarizes the entire philosophy of who I am, the end of the Vedas, a section called Vedanta, literally end of Vedas, which consists of Upanishads. Upanishads discuss about who we are, what's our relationship to that Almighty, and whether I have an existence before and after my death. So each one has argued this point logically and came to a logical conclusion what the truth is, and that is summarizing one great statement in each Veda.\n\nSo in Rugveda from Ayutary Upanishad, we get Prajnaam Brahman. In the end, he says, the real truth is that the consciousness alone is that Almighty, all pervading self. From this Sama Veda in Chandogya Upanishad came Tattvamasi, that thou art, you are that that which you are seeking as the Supreme Lord is your own self. From the Atharva Veda came I am Atma Brahman. After the inquiry about what the self is, it says, my self is Brahman. The self which I consider to be myself is Brahman.\n\nSo that comes from Authoritya Mandukya Upanishadha. The last one is aham, Brahmasmi, I am Brahman. The final realization that Brahman is none other than my own self comes from the Yajurveda, from Bhradharanyaka Upanishad Gita, as we have seen, is Bhagavan. Krishna has collected all those ideas from Upanishads and put in one discourse called Bhagavad Gita. So we had been discussing Bhagavad Gita. We are learning the essence of these great statements.\n\nAnd many commentators have said, as we have discussed, many, many, many Times before that. Tattvamasi is the statement which Gita elaborates upon. So we have learned so far about Dhat and Dao in first 12 chapters. For six chapters we learn about Dao, that is you and I as limited beings. And that segment culminated in Dhyana Yoga, Yoga of Meditation. Once I know who I am as a limited being, now I have to contemplate upon who I am.\n\nThe next six chapters we discussed about that, that Almighty, the Supreme. What is the nature of that? And that culminated into Bhakti Yoga, Yoga of devotion. Once I know myself in that Almighty, I will have nothing but devotion for that self. Once I identify with someone, I will be in love with that person. I love something when I know something.\n\nOnce I know the nature of the supreme, then only I can develop devotion for it. So chapter 12 was Bhakti yoga, yoga of devotion. Chapter 13 now connects the two. So that thou art that correlative verb art is, is what we had been discussing how to make the connection between this limited self which I consider to be myself to that which is Almighty, all pervading. So as we have discussed in Self Unfoldment and before that, this self which I consider is a conditioned self, conditioned in my body. And I consider this is my body.\n\nThis is a gross body which I consider to be my body which is perceived by everybody else. Everybody can see how tall I am, how short I am, how old I am. But then there is a subtle body which I am very aware. You may have inkling about it, but you can't perceive it. That's my mind and intellect. That's like a software in this hardware called body.\n\nBut both of these are in existence because of the third body which is called causal body which is the cause for these two to come into existence. These two cannot come into existence if there is no cause for it. These two came into existence as they are. Why you are not so so powerful, why you are not so smart. He said that's because this is what that cause considered the most appropriate form to transact all the desires and vasanas which I have. So that's causal body.\n\nThe causal body is nothing but the leftover tendencies in vasanas from my past experience experiences from my past experience of buying a house in this area. If I made mistake last time, don't do that again. Next time when I buy the house I look for, well, let's find a good school district because that's what is more important. Let's find which has Best resale value. Now that's more important. Don't fall into the trap of this is the most economical area.\n\nYou need to find something where the resale value is more important. All these are my past impressions of last time, which I made mistake. So the same way Bhagavan says that this body and this mind is also ordered by me, custom designed by me. Like you online and fill out which color car you want and then what shape, what size and what brand and you put together a customized package. I heard somewhere that at Starbucks, the combination of coffee like 5,400 and something that many different varieties of coffee you can order at Starbucks so you can customize your coffee. It's the same way I have customized this existence of mind which I call my limited self.\n\nTotal impressions of my past experiences and tendencies created these two bodies. Subtle body and gross body. That's at my micro level. The total tendencies and impressions of all the beings and things in this Jagat, this universe create the total causal body. And in Sankhya philosophy it's called Mola Prakriti. The original nature of this Prakriti, Mula Prakriti.\n\nIn Vedanta, we call it Maya. That means Yama Samaya. That which is not, but appears to be, that is Maya. These limitations on me as my body, my mind, my intellect are not there. Actually there is no limitations on myself of my mind, my intellect, my body. But it appears to have this limitation.\n\nI feel these limitations when I think about myself. That's because of Maya. Then Maya is nothing but my identification with this body, with this mind, with this intellect. As long as they are there, all the limitations of my body, mind and intellect will be there. Once I get out of that identification, those limitations only remain for the body, for the mind, for the intellect, but not for me. Swami Viranda used to say, I as a Swami has all the problems.\n\nBut I as I has no problem. I as an architect has all the problems, all limitations. But when I remove all those, the I which remains has no problem because it has no limitation. So how to migrate from this limited I and identification to that unlimited I is. Now we'll be discussing from chapter 13 through 18. And therefore the last chapter, chapter 18 will culminate into Moksas and Yoga of liberation to renunciation.\n\nSo we started discussing chapter 13. And we have indicated that the very first verse, Arjuna Vacha, is not in many texts. But it very appropriate that it is interpolated by some commentator. Arjuna said I want to know the nature of these things. What are the things you want to Prakruti? I want to know the nature of Prakriti.\n\nI want to know the nature of Purush also. In addition I want to know Kshetra, Kshatra Gna what is the field and who is the knower of the field. I want to know what is knowledge and what is to be known. So these are the topics we'll be discussing going forward. Somebody put in Arjuna's mouth so that we know. We'll be talking about Purusha and Prakriti, Kshatrakshatragna, Gnanam Ganeyam.\n\nIf I can differentiate between these two, what is Chetranshetraguna? What is Purusha and Prakriti?

And then the next verse, verse 4 says Tatkhetramcha yatcha Yadrukcha Yadvikh Tatsamase. Once again he told us what we are going to be discussing and then we'll be discussing.

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 13 and first we have seen what is the definition the kshatra. And the kshatra is defined in everything that I can see, perceive, think is my field. And the knower is the next subject of discussion, where the last few _Verses_ we have been seeing give the quote, qualities of a seeker who wants to know. The knower needs to develop or will develop in the seeker because of his Mumukshatam, his desire to liberate himself from this limitation. So all the qualities which we are seeing are the attribute which becomes the cause for that revelation. The last quality we have seen, Putra dar gurua adishu.\n\nThe one should be even non attached to not identifying with the putra dara Guru Adi. That which we commonly consider is something which I need to be attached to, I need to be identified with. Here Bhagavan says, you shouldn't be identified with, you know, in Nityamcha sama chittatvam ista anista apapatisha, that he becomes equanimous in all situation, whether ishta or anishta, whether that is conducive or non conducive. In other words, we have been given a pointer that because we have defined nakshatra, we define nakshetra as that which I can perceive is Nakshatra is not the knower. Right now, my identification with my family, my possessions create this notion that that's _part of me. Therefore, the prescription here is you need to develop non identification.\n\nIt did not say not have relationship with. They are my relationship. Putra, dara, gruha, all these are my relationship, my possessions, my acquisition, my achievement. All these I should see. That is something other than me. So my identification remaining with me, I now can relate to them.\n\nAnd that right relationship forms the right sort of dharma for the relationship. And I follow that dharma in the relationship without identifying myself with it is basically the prescription. And therefore it will remain same all the time. Because you realize it's my relations. Relationships are constantly changing. And therefore, no matter what the situation is, I Remain constant in my identification and see this relationship developing and changing.\n\nAnd sometimes this may be ishta. Sometimes which I think is conducive to me. And sometimes it is not. When children come to us, we consider that as ista. But they want to move away from you. We don't consider it ishtar.\n\nBut knowing that it is for their own good, we feel good about letting them go. But if I have not understood that concept about that I need to let the children go for their own good. I will be in the path of their progress. That close identification may cause a person not to achieve his or her full potential. So the non identification is very necessary. Bhagawan says whether the condition is ista or an istha is conducive or non conducive.\n\nThen we continued into few more qualities which Bhagavan says are very essential to understand the nature of the knower. Who is that which is perceiving. Me is this mind and intellect. And then creating this ego. So the prescription here is given because if I have developed the other qualities we discussed, then as Swamiji says, that you have conserved lots of energy, lots of mental energy, lots of intellectual energy. Now you have to apply that somewhere so that it has its own field of actions.\n\nSo the next verse is maiicha Ananya Yogina, Bhaktihi Avyabicharyani. I take all this identification I have right now in this world. Which grounds my personality, it grounds my self esteem. It grounds my identity about who I am. You take all this away from me. I forget I'm an architect.\n\nI forget I have a house and I'm nothing. My grounding in this world is because of my identification with my family, my friends, my organizations, my accomplishment, my profession. Now up till now, you heard that. Take all that away from you. Where is all that energy which I had been putting into the identification can go? And Bhagavan says, maiicha, Ananya Yogina.\n\nYou now shift all that identification to me. There I have an identification. Here I have relationship. Previously I thought my identification is my relationship. My relationship is my identification. Because I identify, I have a relationship.\n\nTake that identification _part and assign it to me. Just leave the relationship. So, Ananya, none other. Identification with none other and then relating to the world as the field of your activity, field of your actions, field of performing your duties is basically Bhagavan says will relieve you from that burden. The bhaktihi avyabicharyani bhakti. Devotion, love for the divine and love.\n\nWe talked about taking this identification. And assigning to the one supreme entity. Who I consider my own self. Which is other than this body, this mind, this intellect. Everything that I know right now is not that. Move all that identification to that.\n\nAnd it should be Ananya. No other identification lingers around. Somebody says, are you faithful to your wife? I'm very faithful, except that I have a couple of love affairs now. Is he really faithful? The very fact that you have other affairs, you are not faithful.\n\nBut people do convince themselves that I'm faithful. Because I'm taking care of. Bhagavan said that kind of identification with me will not be very helpful. Therefore, bhakti aa vyavicharyani vyavichary. In our normal context, when somebody is doing something which is disloyal to his own relationship. On his own, you know, duties is vyabichar.\n\nWe do that to something, to gain something. Just to gain something very frivolous. You are performing their act for a momentary pleasure. You know, identification. No real relationship, but to get some pleasure time being. That relationship is called vyabi charva.\n\nWe can relate that as our identification to the supreme. Are you devoted to Bhagavan? I am very devoted to God. However, this is very important to me. This relationship very important. Well, first is my wife and then my bhagavan.\n\nYour bhakti says avyabicharian for small gain. You will not shift your identification even for a moment to something other than me. You'll be quite constantly identified with me. And then functioning in this world. We have seen standard examples from Swamiji actor performing his _part on the stage. He's never ever identified really with the role.\n\nHe's truly identified with him. Knowing fully who he is. He's performing his role very effectively. That the only reason he can perform his role effectively. Because he knows that he is not the beggar that he is playing. He is a house in Beverly Hills.\n\nTherefore, he can act that beggar so effectively. If you forget he is an actor who is multi millionaire. He will not be able to perform that act. So Bhagavan said that you will be more effective in your relationship. One year bhakti with me is avyabicharini. Never leaves that for small petty gains.\n\nWe identify with things for our small pleasure, small gain in this world. And Bhagavan said, that's what causes you for not realizing yourself so maiicha Ananya Yogyana. Swamiji says, like the new word coined by Krishna in Bhagavad Gita, Ananya Yoga. He said, there's nowhere in those scriptures the word Ananya Yoga is there. But Krishna, in rejuvenating this whole knowledge, is coining new words. So Ananya Yoga, not other.\n\nMy union with him is so firm that there is no other identification. Vivekta desa sevitvaha. So now, if I am the only one in this room, then am I by myself? I'm in solitude or I'm in a company? Well, I say, well, of course, Neel, you're in solitude because there's nobody else here. He said, vivek Tadesha Sevitvam.\n\nI should be practicing to be in solitude, not loneliness. As Swamiji points out, you don't want to be lonely. You don't want to be in solitude. So everybody said, well, that means that I had been thinking about it all along, that this is not going to work. I want to work my profession, have family, friends, all that. And then I'm trying to understand Bhagavad Gita.\n\nBhagavad Gita itself says, go into solitude, then only you will know. Bhagawan said, not really. Solitude is when I identify with that self that alone exists. Then nothing exists other than that. Very, very the other's company. Everything else is nothing but my own manifestation.\n\nEverything else is nothing but my own Leela. Then obviously I'm in a complete solitude. When I'm here by myself, everything I do is just me. Say something, I hear that. But it's solitude because it's all me. That's why I said, in Surat, when I was growing up, there was a Moun Mandir for Sant Morta.\n\nAnd Sant Morta is Moun Mandir. He doesn't even say that. You have to take Bhagavan's name when you go there. He said, you just go into that room, Moun Mandir, they called it, and. And do whatever you want. You can take the books of your profession and read it.\n\nYou can take radio or you can take anything outside. There is the conditions. But you can take books, any type of books, and you can read there, but you are by yourself. Whatever I do is echoing my own thoughts, echoing my own. So I'm in a complete solitude because I'm identifying with nothing other than me alone. That sense of being, establishing yourself, create this solitude.\n\nWorld is going around me, but it's like a dream and therefore I'm in a complete solitude. Vivektadesa sevytvam aratihi janasansa de and he created distaste for the company of other people. Well, obviously once I'm identified with him I obviously see everything else is just a temporary relationship. So I will not be craving for their company. I'll be craving for being in my own self. I may have relationship and therefore I have duties to perform.\n\nI get together with them, I talk to them, I But I'm always in my solitude. So I'm not craving for their company because my identification is gone. What do we really crave for? Where we identify with and say I really need to go and see my mom or I need to go and see such and such only because we have an identification. Once the identification is shifted from this field to the knower of the field then obviously there is no craving for this field. So Bhagavan continues.\n\nNow he says what is the purpose of all these things? Adhatmagna nittvatum Tattvagna. For the purpose of knowing the Tattvagna, that knowledge which I am seeking. As we say, my true nature is sat chit and Ananda. The chit is seeking the knowledge. But it's gaining right now knowledge which is actually in my way to know my knowledge by doing all that which is prescribed in few _Verses_.\n\nNow I will build a tattvagna arth darshanam. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. I can see what is my goal to achieve. Swamiji explained that even we go to the station and we say which is the train is the Madras. That's because the train is not in Madras right now, but it is going to Madras. So right now I may not be there but I see what is the goal for my being where my identification will be established.\n\nThat's why Tattvagna arthadarshanam. I will know the essence of the knowledge about me. Adhyatmagna Nityatvam constancy of the self knowledge. See, in our case we get glimpse about who I am. But then we constantly shift that identify something else which is also temporary and therefore no time. We have a constancy of identification about who I am, what I am.\n\nAt some point I thought I'm a very good student. Some point I thought, well, I'm a very good worker.",
      "reflection": "Today, practice distinguishing the field from the knower of the field. When emotions arise, notice: 'This is happening in the field, and I am aware of it.' When thoughts arise, the same.\n\nYou are not your thoughts, not your emotions, not your body. You are that which is aware of all these. This simple shift in identification—from the observed to the observer—is the beginning of liberation.\n\nPay attention to the moments when you forget this distinction and get lost in experience. Can you notice the moment of forgetting? The moment of remembering?"

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 13, Kshatra Kshatragna, Vibhag Yoga, Yoga of differentiation between the field and its knower. So the quest in our life is to know, is there an entity which knows that I exist? I know I exist as this body because of the identification with this body. I exist as my mind and I exist as my intellect. But is the existence beyond this existence of this body, mind and intellect? So that's the quest in our life, which is what we call immortality.\n\nAfter this body is destroyed, mind is destroyed, intellect is destroyed, will there be existence? So we had been learning from Bhagavan. From chapter one through 12, we have learned that yes, there is something which remains in existence even when these three are not existent. And that we called our supreme self. And this we call a limited self all. And through we have learned one thing and one thing alone.\n\nBhagavan continue to saying that no matter whichever way you look at it, it is my existence alone. Even this limited existence is none other than my own existence. Everything which you see is nothing but me alone. In chapter 10, which was Vibhuti Yoga, the divine Glories, Bhagawan said that everything that you see in this world is me, but my presence can only be felt in perfection. Everybody can be a singer, but I only recognize the good singing. When somebody is singing in a perfect shruti and perfect, that's the time I enjoy the music.\n\nBhagawan said that's where you will recognize my presence. But in the same chapter he came back and said that all these qualities which are contradictory to each other, you see in this world, they're all mine. It is not that I am in fear, but not in fearlessness. So in chapter 10 we have learned in verse 4 and 5, he defined that Buddhi, Jnana, Asammoha, Ksham, Satyam, Dhamma, Shamah, Sukkam, Dukkham, Bhava, Abhava, Bhaya, Abhaya, they all contracted each other. Ahinsa Samatha tustihi tapa dana yasaha ayya saha bhavanti bhava bhutana matte evaputagvidaha. They manifest in people different ways.\n\nBut they're all my qualities. I am the efficient cause. And all the qualities and things and beings which you see are the effects. Depending on the equipment, the effect may be different. We have been discussing this classical example of electricity involved. Depending on the bulb, the manifestation will be different.\n\nBut all the manifestations are of the same source. So we had been learning that everything which I see, the hunted and the hunter both are expression of the same entity. But he said, not only the hunter hunted. The savior of the hunted from the hunter is also me. Hunter is exhibiting the lower qualities. The savior is exhibiting the higher qualities is the only difference.\n\nThere is none that is not me. We want to divide our world into divine and devilish. This is good, this is bad. But one continues to tell us that that's not the case. The world, as you see, is my own expression. So in this chapter 13 we are going a step further.\n\nIn chapter 10 he said, all qualities are mine. Yasa, apayasa, fear, fearlessness. Now he says there is a difference between the two which is what this chapter is all about. Kshetra, Kshatra Gna. The field is this Jagat. The field is the world of my experiences.\n\nAnd there we included everything that we know. My body, my mind, my intellect, idam Sariram. The 24 expressions of Prakriti that he included in the Idam sariram. Then he says the modifications of them, modification expressions as we experience. All these are expressions of the field with the vikras. Vikras in the modification elements in their own form.\n\nWhen they come together with each other. All these 24 which are seen as 10 senses. Five sense objects, mind, intellect, buddhi, five great elements. All this when they're interacting with each other. What comes out are the vikaras are the modificator which we experience. So they are part of this field.\n\nThey are inherent in the field and cannot be avoided. So that famous Gujarati poem said Sukhadukha, Manamanaani, Ghatta, Satyre, gadiya. They are embodied in the field itself. That the very expression of the self that cannot be avoided. As long as we are part of this world, they will be there. But then it says you can recognize the knower who is distinctly different from the field.\n\nSo then we have seen these 20 qualities which are the qualities of the Knower, as we have seen previously, there are divine qualities and devilish qualities. Divine are expressing this higher self. Others are expressing the lower self. But both are belonging to the same supreme being. Here we are going a step a little further in our analysis and say, what is it that makes me unhappy? He said, that's part of the Prakriti.\n\nAs long as they are bound by this Prakriti, in other words, as long as I'm identified with this body, this mind, this intellect, these are bound to occur. It cannot be avoided no matter how hard you try. We have all these mitigating plans. Invest in your 401ks. Well, no, put in mutual funds and then no, put some in the bonds. Eventually we realized that there was no really a foolproof formula.\n\nNo matter what you do, you are going to lose somewhere. You are going to win somewhere as long as you keep equal minded. That's what they said. Monthly contribution. Even mindedly, no matter where the market is, you put your 401k in it. As long as you have that discipline.\n\nHe said, in the end you will be the winner. Bhagawan says same thing. Even mindedly you keep doing your work. No matter what the circumstances are. Then you will be the winner. In the end you will be okay.\n\nSo we have seen these qualities of the fields. And now we know what the field is. The knower we have defined by 20 qualities. These qualities can be considered as prerequisites to recognize the self. On the other hand, these are actually the qualities of the Knower himself. When knower is shining through you, all these qualities which we have been learning for last few weeks will be exhibited.\n\nSo when you see these qualities, recognize that this is the manifestation of the knower who is distinctly different from the field. So I get attached to my moonkanish gmail com. The attachment is created by Prakriti. But detachment is created by the knower. Therefore, all of us who came here, our parents are too attached to us, you know, as children. But they gladly, even though they were sad that you're going to leave their home, they gladly let you come.\n\nProbably they knew we will never go back. We will probably not write to them on a monthly basis, but because their true love for you, which is the expression of the knower, attachment wants you to keep with them. Let him make his own progress as an individual. So these qualities we have been looking at are the Noah's quality. One binds you to this Prakriti, other liberates you from this Prakriti. But the field is no different than the knower.\n\nField is also my expression. And in the verse 12 we say Eithat gnanam iti proktam. This is what are called as the knowledge. So in the end he defined the knowledge as Adhyatma gnana nithyatvam. Constant awareness about the self is the knowledge. Constantly aware that I am not this limited being.\n\nThis limited being is an instrument through which I function. That's the knower Tattvagna arsadarshanam. These are the two basic definitions of the knower we came across here. Tattvagna artha Darshanam. Why do I really want to know the truth? The goal should be in my mind.\n\nUnless I have a goal in mind, I won't have the enthusiasm. It is like if I am working hard all year, I have to have some goal. What I am going to achieve at the end of the year? Well, when my review comes, maybe my supervisor will recognize I have been working hard. You need to have a goal, the end game, so that you have an enthusiasm to pursue the path. So all these 20 qualities if I consider as my prerequisites and want to develop, I need to have a goal in mind and more, I have the goal in mind.\n\nThese qualities by themselves will manifest because my goal is now the correct goal. This is called knowledge. Bhagwan said, everything contrary to that is Agnanam. Everything contrary to that which I consider to be me is ignorance about my own self. I told you the knowledge Yajnatva amrutam asnute. Having known this knowledge, you will attain immortality.\n\nBecause the mortality is in reference to this body, this mind, this intellect. As long as I am not identified with it, those mortalities are not mine. Body's mortality mind. They are my equipment. And they will have its own use. And once the use is complete, I will have no use for it.\n\nImmortality I am beyond. This mortal being is immortality. Having known which you will know that Anadi matparam Brahma nasat nasat. So we want to be immortal. He said no, that doesn't happen that way. No being can be immortal.\n\nAs long as you are a being, you'll be birth and a death. But that immortality is neither a being nor a non being. It's not that because it's not a being, it has no existence. He said it is neither a being nor not being. It is neither a being because it does not have any qualities of a limited being. Therefore it's not a being can be defined by shape, color, form, need.\n\nTherefore it's not a being also not non being. It's not non existent, non being, non existent. It exists and therefore it's also not non being. And then we have seen the verse which says now I need to know. I know what the knowledge is. But what is to be known that being neither a being nor a non being is?\n\nWe have seen this description before in chapter 11 in Virata Swarupa. And I see thousands of mouths and thousands of hands and thousands of eyes and thousands of years. As we have also discussed that in Purusha Shuktam dug Veda it is Sahasra Sivasa, Purusha, Sahasraksha Sahasrapat. Thousands of hands and thousands of mouth. Once again he repeats that Sarvatha hani padam. Everywhere the hands and legs, Tat sarvath akshihi shiramukham, sarvatham.\n\nAll hands and legs are his. All eyes and head and mouth are his. Sarvatha smriti matloke. All the years are his. Sarvam avrutyati sthati. He remains pervading all, pervading everywhere.\n\nEven though he does not have any qualities, he pervades in all the years. All the hands, all, all the mouth, all the heads, everything that I can think of, he's pervading all. Tarva Indriya guna abhasham. It is shining through all the senses. Its presence is felt through the senses. When I can see, I know I'm alive.\n\nWhen I can hear, I know I'm alive. The proof of my existence is it's shining through my senses. As long as my eyes are seeing and my mouth is speaking, people can vouch for it. I think he's okay when it is not. Then simple life is gone. He is shining through all the indriyas.\n\nSarva Indriya vi varjitam. But he is devoid of all indriyas. Here comes the conundrum. This is only taught dichotomically because we cannot understand the subtlety of it. We try to explain, but we can't explain. Therefore now we have to explain in a dichotomy.\n\nNeither it was the night nor was the day.",
      "reflection": "Today, practice distinguishing the field from the knower of the field. When emotions arise, notice: 'This is happening in the field, and I am aware of it.' When thoughts arise, the same.\n\nYou are not your thoughts, not your emotions, not your body. You are that which is aware of all these. This simple shift in identification—from the observed to the observer—is the beginning of liberation.\n\nPay attention to the moments when you forget this distinction and get lost in experience. Can you notice the moment of forgetting? The moment of remembering?"

      "commentary": "We have seen in this chapter that in verse number three, Bhagavan has given us a formula for liberation where he basically says that knowledge of the field plus the knowledge of the knower of the field equals to the knowledge of the supreme self. So to find this enlightenment, Bhagavan said, you need to know both _part and _part _part, the field of experiences. And the experiencer and Bhagavan in the same verse told us that _part is only one. I am the supreme Lord, the experiencer in all the fields. I am the knower in all the fields. As we have discussed before that the consciousness is one and all pervading, but it manifests through the equipment which we call it body, mind and intellect.\n\nAnd we feel that this consciousness is within me. But in last few verses Bhagavad has described that that conscious all pervading, but I feel it is within me because it is within and without all things and beings. So all things and beings are in the consciousness, but we feel the consciousness is within me. Very similar to our analogy of space. It's in the space in the room, but actually room is in the space. So we have been given detailed explanation about the Kshatram _part.\n\nSo we have seen the definition of kshatra from verse 6 to 6 and 7. What is the field of experience? It says this body is the field in that has included the five great elements, all the way up to the modifications of mind, up to the fortitude, the dhruti. So everything that I consider as part of my world is included in the field of experiences. And then from verse 8 through 12, Bhagavana has described qualities to be developed starting from humility, Amanitvam, ending with _part, _part, _part, _part, the goal of knowing the knower of the field. What is the purpose of having this knowledge that Bhagavan has described?\n\nAnd these qualities are the means to achieve the knowledge. So Bhagavan called it _part _part is developing these qualities or having these qualities in knowledge. Anything other than that is ignorance. Opposite of all those qualities is ignorance. All these things are limiting me. This showing off high opinion about myself.\n\nCause of that when I hurt other people knowingly or unknowingly, that's the expression of ignorance. So anything other than these 20 qualities, Bhagavan called it ignorance. And then Bhagavan has described what is to be known in very contradictory terms. Starting from the verse 13 Anadi Matparam Brahma. That Brahman which needs to be known is beginningless and _part _part na uchate. It is neither _part nor _part.\n\nIt is also not nothing. So in this contradictory terms, Bhagavan has been explaining the nature of the supreme Brahman that is to be known. That is the goal of knowledge. We came to the last verse we have discussed. We say Bahihi anthasch bhutana _part _part evacha. That supreme Being is within and without all beings.\n\nIt is easier for us to think that he is within me and within all the sentient beings. Very, very difficult for me to imagine that he is also outside of me. It appears to be within me, but actually my equipment is within this supreme conscious. Space seems to be within the room defined by its conditionings, four walls, ceiling and floor. But actually space was always here and it will always remain here. Even when you remove this conditionings.\n\nEven though this equipment I call myself as identified with the body, mind and intellect. It seems it is the container for this consciousness. But once it is actually within the consciousness, _part _part evacha. So it is not just limited to the beings. Also things which are achara within a pot and also is outside the pot. But however, I have no experience of this.\n\nSo Bhagavan says it is because suksma twat on vignam. It is so subtle that it is not easy to know. So things which are within the capabilities of my senses, I can perceive them. So I can see the visible light. Light is the form of an electromagnetic wave. But within the capabilities of my eyes I can see the visible light.\n\nBut any other electromagnetic wave beyond that, I'm not capable of seeing them. Radio waves are all over in this room, but I'm not capable of detecting them. But the right equipment, it can be detected because they are so subtle that my senses are not capable of grasping them. That does not mean they do not exist. Bhagavan says Sukshma Tvat of Vignayam because the supreme Self, the supreme consciousness which is everywhere, it is not known to us because of its subtlety. _part for those who are ignorant about its nature, it is too far to find that right now.\n\nIt is very overwhelming for me to even think that consciousness is everywhere. Therefore it is too far for me that is also very close to those who understand its very nature. So one who understands its very nature and experience, for him it is so close because it cannot be any further than my own self. How far I am from my own self, there is no distance to be measured there. I am who I am, where I am. If that I am is the same as the supreme Consciousness, if that understanding takes place, Bhagavan said, very, very close to you.\n\nIt is far for the people who have not understood its real nature, but very close to the people who understood its nature. Bhagavan continues in the next verse and says, Vibhaktam Ivachasthitam Even though it is indivisible, it is undivided, ever present, all pervading. It also remains in people as divided selves. So it is something similar to the space we have discussed. Even though the space is indivisible, space cannot be divided, cannot be cut, cannot be separated, cannot be made into pieces. But I feel it is divided among all the rooms and buildings and huts and whatever the type of containers that I can imagine in this world.\n\nSo space is divided into small box, big box, small house, big house. However, its very nature is indivisible. So these days, repurposing the old building is a big trend. Because as we, as we call the greenest building is the one which is not built. The second greenest building is one which is repurposed, which is existing. When you repurpose the building, it's always old, really messy.\n\nBut if you are trained in that profession, then you will visualize the space without all the distractions you have from the existing walls and floors and ceilings. Then you figure out that if I can combine all this space and repurpose it, I can make it useful for whatever the purpose. We are using this building because the space is always indivisible. It is I as the architect who put those divisions in it. So Bhagavan seat for all the people who feel that the concept within them, he remains as the knower within them, but he remains same for everyone. Aviv Bhaktam never gets divided, never gets polluted, never gets chained never gets affected by all the qualities of all those things and beings.\n\nBut he remains as he is, but appears to be divided in beings. Bhuta Bhartrucha Tatgneam Bhuta Bharat Rahu is the supporter of all. When I exist in my present state, he is a supporter of my existence. I exist because I'm conscious. My consciousness is the supporter of my existence with Bhuta Bhartra. So the same supreme being which is no qualities, neither Sat nor Asat.\n\nWhen he sustains this world, he becomes Vishnu Bhuta Bhartra _part. When he devours that, when that existence ends, he is the devourer. When the time of Pralaya he devours the whole world, goes back into that unmanifest state so that he is _part. He is also the devourer of all things and being. When I'll die, my consciousness associated with this limited self will not be there. So he is the devourer of my existence as it exists today.\n\nPrabha Vishnucha When I come into the existence in a new form or when I came into existence in this form, he was the generator. Without that awareness that I exist, I do not exist. That awareness started right from my birth. The very breath you take, you realize that I am so. Bhagavan said Tat Ganeyam _part Prabhupishnucha. I am the sustainer of this universe and all things and beings.\n\nI am also devourer of all things and beings. I am also the generator of things in being. _part, you need to know that. _part so if I cannot know that right now, then the question would be whether that's darkness. The things which are unavailable to me, I consider that to be its ignorance. Bhagavan says in the next question.\n\nNo, that is not the case. Jyoti Sam Apita Jyoti hi. It is the light of all lights. You know, the sun is self effulgent. But to see the sunlight I have to be conscious. If I'm not conscious, the sun does not exist for me.\n\nSunlight does not exist for me. Therefore my consciousness is actually the illuminator of the sun which is self effulgent. Tamasah Jyoti Tamasah Paramuchya beyond darkness, where there is knowledge, there cannot be ignorance. Where there is light, there cannot be darkness. Therefore this self which is very aware of its own self, it is the light of all lights. It is the source of all knowledge.\n\nIt is the source of all my experiences _part Gneanagamya it resides in all hearts in a very special way _part not just that it stays there as inactive entity in a very special way it participates in all its activities. All that person's activities. So Rudhi Sarvasive Sisthitam he stays in the hearts of all hearts the core of my consciousness, my intellect, my mind. _part _part Gnanagamyam that is knowledge also that is to be known There is also _part it is the object of the knowledge. So all three Bhagavan said is the one and the same, the supreme Self, the knowledge, the purpose of the knowing, the knowledge and the means for the knowledge is the supreme Self. ITI _part Tatha _part _part Cha Uktam sama Sataha so Bhagavan is concluding the topic saying look, I told you in the beginning we're going to talk about _part and _part _part.\n\nWe'll talk about the knowledge and what is to be known. I explained to you what the _part is. So explained what _part? _part is the one which pervades everywhere. But it seems like divided into all things and beings. Also explained to _part what is knowledge?\n\nKnowledge that enables me to know the supreme self is the knowledge. Therefore we have seen those 20 qualities from Amanitvam to Tatvagnan Orthodarsanam and also explain to you what is to be known. My devotees knowing these will come to my being. As we have said in the beginning Bhagavan has given this formula the knowledge of the field plus the knowledge of the knower of the field equals to the knowledge of the supreme Self. But once now I told you what is the goal? The goal is to know the Supreme Self and the formula is to know the _part and also know the who is the knower of _part?\n\nWhat is my field of experiences and who is the experiencer? Once you have understood both then you are my _part that you have dissolved your individuality in that supreme self. So mad _part, the one who has surrendered his individuality, one who has surrendered his sense of agency. Once I realized that _part in me I considered to be my ego. So when I considered my consciousness, I am the knower of my experiences, the experiencer, the perceiver, feeler, thinker actually refer to my ego.",

Even when you remove this conditionings.\n\nEven though this equipment I call myself as identified with the body, mind and intellect. It seems it is the container for this consciousness. But once it is actually within the consciousness, _part _part evacha. So it is not just limited to the beings. Also things which are achara within a pot and also is outside the pot. But however, I have no experience of this.\n\nSo Bhagavan says it is because suksma twat on vignam. It is so subtle that it is not easy to know. So things which are within the capabilities of my senses, I can perceive them. So I can see the visible light. Light is the form of an electromagnetic wave. But within the capabilities of my eyes I can see the visible light.\n\nBut any other electromagnetic wave beyond that, I'm not capable of seeing them. Radio waves are all over in this room, but I'm not capable of detecting them. But the right equipment, it can be detected because they are so subtle that my senses are not capable of grasping them. That does not mean they do not exist. Bhagavan says Sukshma Tvat of Vignayam because the supreme Self, the supreme consciousness which is everywhere, it is not known to us because of its subtlety. _part for those who are ignorant about its nature, it is too far to find that right now.\n\nIt is very overwhelming for me to even think that consciousness is everywhere. Therefore it is too far for me that is also very close to those who understand its very nature. So one who understands its very nature and experience, for him it is so close because it cannot be any further than my own self. How far I am from my own self, there is no distance to be measured there. I am who I am, where I am. If that I am is the same as the supreme Consciousness, if that understanding takes place, Bhagavan said, very, very close to you.\n\nIt is far for the people who have not understood its real nature, but very close to the people who understood its nature. Bhagavan continues in the next verse and says, Vibhaktam Ivachasthitam Even though it is indivisible, it is undivided, ever present, all pervading. It also remains in people as divided selves. So it is something similar to the space we have discussed. Even though the space is indivisible, space cannot be divided, cannot be cut, cannot be separated, cannot be made into pieces. But I feel it is divided among all the rooms and buildings and huts and whatever the type of containers that I can imagine in this world.\n\nSo space is divided into small box, big box, small house, big house. However, its very nature is indivisible. So these days, repurposing the old building is a big trend. Because as we, as we call the greenest building is the one which is not built. The second greenest building is one which is repurposed, which is existing. When you repurpose the building, it's always old, really messy.\n\nBut if you are trained in that profession, then you will visualize the space without all the distractions you have from the existing walls and floors and ceilings. Then you figure out that if I can combine all this space and repurpose it, I can make it useful for whatever the purpose. We are using this building because the space is always indivisible. It is I as the architect who put those divisions in it. So Bhagavan seat for all the people who feel that the concept within them, he remains as the knower within them, but he remains same for everyone. Aviv Bhaktam never gets divided, never gets polluted, never gets chained never gets affected by all the qualities of all those things and beings.\n\nBut he remains as he is, but appears to be divided in beings. Bhuta Bhartrucha Tatgneam Bhuta Bharat Rahu is the supporter of all. When I exist in my present state, he is a supporter of my existence. I exist because I'm conscious. My consciousness is the supporter of my existence with Bhuta Bhartra. So the same supreme being which is no qualities, neither Sat nor Asat.\n\nWhen he sustains this world, he becomes Vishnu Bhuta Bhartra _part. When he devours that, when that existence ends, he is the devourer. When the time of Pralaya he devours the whole world, goes back into that unmanifest state so that he is _part. He is also the devourer of all things and being. When I'll die, my consciousness associated with this limited self will not be there. So he is the devourer of my existence as it exists today.\n\nPrabha Vishnucha When I come into the existence in a new form or when I came into existence in this form, he was the generator. Without that awareness that I exist, I do not exist. That awareness started right from my birth. The very breath you take, you realize that I am so. Bhagavan said Tat Ganeyam _part Prabhupishnucha. I am the sustainer of this universe and all things and beings.\n\nI am also devourer of all things and beings. I am also the generator of things in being. _part, you need to know that. _part so if I cannot know that right now, then the question would be whether that's darkness. The things which are unavailable to me, I consider that to be its ignorance. Bhagavan says in the next question.\n\nNo, that is not the case. Jyoti Sam Apita Jyoti hi. It is the light of all lights. You know, the sun is self effulgent. But to see the sunlight I have to be conscious. If I'm not conscious, the sun does not exist for me.\n\nSunlight does not exist for me. Therefore my consciousness is actually the illuminator of the sun which is self effulgent. Tamasah Jyoti Tamasah Paramuchya beyond darkness, where there is knowledge, there cannot be ignorance. Where there is light, there cannot be darkness. Therefore this self which is very aware of its own self, it is the light of all lights. It is the source of all knowledge.\n\nIt is the source of all my experiences _part Gneanagamya it resides in all hearts in a very special way _part not just that it stays there as inactive entity in a very special way it participates in all its activities. All that person's activities. So Rudhi Sarvasive Sisthitam he stays in the hearts of all hearts the core of my consciousness, my intellect, my mind. _part _part Gnanagamyam that is knowledge also that is to be known There is also _part it is the object of the knowledge. So all three Bhagavan said is the one and the same, the supreme Self, the knowledge, the purpose of the knowing, the knowledge and the means for the knowledge is the supreme Self. ITI _part Tatha _part _part Cha Uktam sama Sataha so Bhagavan is concluding the topic saying look, I told you in the beginning we're going to talk about _part and _part _part.\n\nWe'll talk about the knowledge and what is to be known. I explained to you what the _part is. So explained what _part? _part is the one which pervades everywhere. But it seems like divided into all things and beings. Also explained to _part what is knowledge?\n\nKnowledge that enables me to know the supreme self is the knowledge. Therefore we have seen those 20 qualities from Amanitvam to Tatvagnan Orthodarsanam and also explain to you what is to be known. My devotees knowing these will come to my being. As we have said in the beginning Bhagavan has given this formula the knowledge of the field plus the knowledge of the knower of the field equals to the knowledge of the supreme Self. But once now I told you what is the goal? The goal is to know the Supreme Self and the formula is to know the _part and also know the who is the knower of _part?\n\nWhat is my field of experiences and who is the experiencer? Once you have understood both then you are my _part that you have dissolved your individuality in that supreme self. So mad _part, the one who has surrendered his individuality, one who has surrendered his sense of agency. Once I realized that _part in me I considered to be my ego. So when I considered my consciousness, I am the knower of my experiences, the experiencer, the perceiver, feeler, thinker actually refer to my ego.",
      "reflection": "Today, practice distinguishing the field from the knower of the field. When emotions arise, notice: 'This is happening in the field, and I am aware of it.' When thoughts arise, the same.\n\nYou are not your thoughts, not your emotions, not your body. You are that which is aware of all these. This simple shift in identification—from the observed to the observer—is the beginning of liberation.\n\nPay attention to the moments when you forget this distinction and get lost in experience. Can you notice the moment of forgetting? The moment of remembering?"

      "commentary": "We have been discussing Chapter 13, Kshatrakshatragna Vibhaga Yoga, Yoga of Discrimination between the Field and its Knower. So far we have seen in this chapter the Bhagawan has described the Kshetra that this body is the Kshatra that includes not only the external instrument, also the internal instrument which mind Buddhi, Chittanahanka and all its modifications. Kshatragna is Paramatma alone. The Supreme Lord, the God, the Almighty, all pervading consciousness is the Kshatragni in all the fields. Then he said, I'm going to tell you what is Gnanam, Gnayam, Gnanagamyam. What is knowledge, what is to be known and how.\n\nThen he explained how this Purusha and Prakriti are related to each other. The Purusha and Prakriti intertwine themselves and create this world which we experience. Purusha and Prakriti both are beginningless, both are the aspects of Ishwara. So in our cosmology we have Purusha and Prakriti. Both are beginningless, but they are controlled by Ishwara. Ishwara is the Mayapathy.\n\nIshvara is in charge of Maya. So Brahman with Maya becomes Ishwara and Ishwara is the Mayapati with his Maya he controls both the Prakriti and Purusha. Purusha is the knower. The attributes of Purusha we have seen Sat, Chit and Ananda. So Purusha is Sat, existence, Chit, Knowledge and Ananda the Bliss. These are the attributes of Purusha, the knower.\n\nThen Prakriti has three Gunas, Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. Purusha has no Gunas, Prakruti has three Gunas. Purusha is sentient conscious. But interaction with the two create this world that we experience. So that's basically what we have so far learnt in this discussion. The last verse which we have seen which says Purushaha, Prakriti Staha Bhumte Prakriti Janguna.\n\nWhen seated in Prakriti, when intertwined with the Prakriti, it experiences all the gunas of the Prakriti. Karanam Guna, Sangasya Sad Asat, Yoni Janmasu. And attachment to the Gunas is the cause for the birth in good or not so good wombs. In other words, the existence which I experience right now in this life is because of my attachment and avidya to the Gunas in my past life. Maybe two years before or before my birth. What I'm experiencing today is because of my attachment to the gunas of the Prakriti.\n\nBecause as the Purusha adopted all the Gunas so Purusha coming in contact with the Prakriti. All the gunas of the Prakriti are superimposed on the Purusha Purushas. All the attributes get superimposed in the Prakriti. So Prakriti experience the Satchit and Ananda. That's why we experience the sense of existence. And also we experience Sukha and Dukha as we have seen in this everywhere.\n\nPrakriti on the other hand becomes sentient. Therefore my body becomes sentient, inert body becomes sentient. My mind knows and I also feel that Ananda or Sukharga. So he said Purusha Prante, Prakti. That's the reason we come into being. So we have like three bodies.\n\nThe gross body which everybody can see. The subtle body which is the internal instrument, the mind Buddhi Chitta Nahanka and the causal body which is the cause for both these bodies to come into existence. Which is my left Tor Vasanas, leftover desires which is what we learned in this previous chapter. The leftover impressions and desires prompt me to take birth in this particular situation. So these two bodies come into existence because of the past Karma Bhagavan Sangha is Sat Karma Janyam. Because of your good actions you achieve this gross and subtle body in this life.\n\nAnd then he said, how this Pratibimba I think Jina, your question was is there anything reflecting? And Bhagavan Sankaraja Satupa directly answered that question saying Sthula Sarira Abhimani Jiva Namakam Brahmaprati Bambam Bhavati Sa Eva Jivaha Prakritya Swasmat Iswaram Binnat Vena Janati. So it says that the reflection of Brahman, the all pervading Almighty consciousness which is immutable undividable. Its reflection occurs in the internal instrument of that being. That being now receives the impressions reflection of the Brahman. And that is called Jiva.\n\nNow this Brahman as the Purusha reflecting in the internal instrument of individual ego is called Jiva. So it's called Jivaatma atma. The self or the soul, it's called Jiva atma. This Jiva by nature of ignorance consider itself to be different from the Ishvara. This is where we not experience the almightiness of Ishvara. The consciousness which we have is nothing but the Buddhist all pervading Purusha's consciousness.\n\nThe Purusa as my soul has the same nature as the Brahman which is of Sat, Chit and Ananda. So this Sat aspect gives me the sense of existence. The Cheetah aspect gives me the sense of knowing. That's why I know myself, I know the world around me. I know my relationships that comes from that. And Ananda that I experience Sukhendukha in my life.\n\nSo this reflection is in my internal instrument. This internal instrument is right now not clean enough. It is also reflecting all other things of Prakriti. So this is more like if I am sitting in a dark room and suddenly light comes on and I see there are mirrors all around me. In that mirror not only I see myself but I also see everything in the room. Now not only I recognize myself in in the mirror but I also recognize everything in the room and I start identifying with them.\n\nSo the internal instrument not only reflects the Purusha, it also reflecting the world of objects. All the sensory perceptions we get, we get the sensation through our senses on the internal instrument. The internal instrument is like a mirror or like a film in a camera. It captures everything which comes to it whether it's a Purusha or the world of objects. It captures all the images. That sensation creates perception in the mind.\n\nThen the mind asks the intellect to interpret and it creates conception. That's how we conceive thoughts, we conceive ideas, we conceive things outside. So Bhagawan Shankaracharya says it is the Brahman reflecting in your internal instruments become your individual ego. But I don't recognize it the same as Ishvara. Purusha with the Upadi of Maya becomes Ishwara Purusha with the Upadi of ignorance. In my case same Purusha superimposed by the ignorance, he becomes Jiva, the individual soul conditioned consciousness in case of Lord, unconditioned consciousness superimposed by Maya, by creativity.\n\nWhy Bhagavan creates the world? Because it is the very nature of that Purusha. So with that we'll go to the next verse. So next verse says, even though I see that as the cause for my birth in this Sansar, but this supreme Purusa in me, the reflection of the Brahman which I consider to be my limited self, also can be seen as Upadrista, Anumanta, Chabharta, Loka, Maheshwaraha, Paramatma, Iticha, opi Uktaha, dehe Ashmin, Purushah, Paraha, that Purushahaparaha, the supreme Purusha. In this body, the same supreme being which is everywhere, also in the same body. I call myself a Jiva.\n\nAn individual ego also is called Upadrasta, the onlooker. Because it is not really taking any part in the activities of my body, mind and intellect. This gross body, this subtle mind and intellect, they're functioning all the time. They are empowered by consciousness, consciousness not taking part in it. Therefore it is also called Upadrasta, onlooker, anumantacha. So that onlooker does not really discriminate between the good activity or bad activities.\n\nBut when my mind is thinking something higher, something nobler, something greater, he also becomes permitter. He allows me to act in that particular manner which will help me in my evolution. When I act in that manner, he becomes Bharata, the supporter of my activities and my evolution. He also becomes Bhokta. He also become the enjoyer of those actions. So this Purusha in me is a witness.\n\nHe also permits all the things which I do, good or evil. But when it is good, it allows me to grow, then also makes me enjoy those fruits of actions. He is also called Maheshwarah because he is no different than the Great Lord himself. Therefore he is also called Maheshwara. Maheshwara the Great Lord himself and Paramatma in the supreme soul. But looking from the different perspective, when I grow out of my ignorance that I am this body, I am this mind intellect, then I see him as the same Lord Paramatma.\n\nI see him as Maheshwara, the Great Ishwara. So there is no difference between the Lord outside and Lord within me. Therefore, Bhagawan Shankaracharya says this should not be accepted. That Jiva and Paramatma are two different entities. It is one and the same, seen from two different perspectives, one through the lens of ignorance and Other through the lens of knowledge. Sa evam vitti purusam prakritim cha gunaihi saha sarvatha vartamano PI nasabuyo abhijayate.\n\nSuch a person who knows Purusha and Prakruti in their real nature, he knows that nature Purusha is satchit and Ananda. It never gets tainted by Prakruti's gunas. But Prakruti's gunas are superimposed on the Purusha when it comes in contact with it. We have heard example in Brahma sutras that if you take a iron ball and put it in fire, each will give its own gunas to the other. So the fire which is red hot, now the ball looks red hot. So the fire attributes are now on the iron ball.\n\nAnd the fire which was formless, now you can see the round shape. Because that ball was round, you see the red hot ball of iron. So each gives its own attributes to the other when they come in contact with each other. So in this case also that we have seen that the Prakrudin Purusa gives each other their own attributes. One who knows that that they remain separate. They seem to be associated with each other.\n\nThey seem to be taking each other's gunas, but they remain separate Gunehi Saha including the gunas, Sarvatha, Varsamanoapi. No matter what situation or condition that person is, he doesn't take the next board. And this is somewhat of a difficult concept because it basically says all my actions in the past and present and future get nullified when I get this knowledge. So there are some technical arguments made here that what happens to the actions which I have performed in the past which are Sanchita Karma? So the actions are three types. Sanchida Karma, Agami Karma and Prarabdha Karma.\n\nPrarabdha Karmas are which I am experiencing right now. The past actions mature today as my circumstances. I went to architecture school. I'm an architect now. That's a Prarabdhyakarna. So if a Gnani becomes knowledgeable about this, do all his karmas get nullified?\n\nAnd the answer is no. He will continue to experience the Prarabdha Karma which I have matured now in this life. So you will still live this life. But then this Sanchita Karma which accumulated actions which are not yet matured, they get roasted so they never will fructify. And Agame Karma, which I will perform now onward, will have no Meaning because it does not create any more vasanas in me. We have realized that I am not this limited being.\n\nAnd therefore I don't associate any of the gunas of the body, mind and intellect, even though body, mind and intellect continue to function as they were before. Therefore, these verses say, such a person, at the end of the exhaustion of this life, he will not take the birth again. So I'll leave it to you how you take it. But that's exactly what this verse says. The next verse says how people achieve the state of knowledge, that all the accumulated actions get burned. Prarabdha Karma means nothing because I don't really see myself as the enjoyer, sufferer, as a limited being.\n\nAnd no actions in the future will make and any difference. Some highly qualified seekers, seekers of liberation, seekers of ultimate happiness, those who are highly qualified, they will achieve this by contemplation.",
      "reflection": "Today, practice distinguishing the field from the knower of the field. When emotions arise, notice: 'This is happening in the field, and I am aware of it.' When thoughts arise, the same.\n\nYou are not your thoughts, not your emotions, not your body. You are that which is aware of all these. This simple shift in identification—from the observed to the observer—is the beginning of liberation.\n\nPay attention to the moments when you forget this distinction and get lost in experience. Can you notice the moment of forgetting? The moment of remembering?"

So far we have seen in this chapter the Bhagawan has described the Kshetra that this body is the Kshatra that includes not only the external instrument, also the internal instrument which mind Buddhi, Chittanahanka and all its modifications. Kshatragna is Paramatma alone. The Supreme Lord, the God, the Almighty, all pervading consciousness is the Kshatragni in all the fields. Then he said, I'm going to tell you what is Gnanam, Gnayam, Gnanagamyam. What is knowledge, what is to be known and how.\n\nThen he explained how this Purusha and Prakriti are related to each other. The Purusha and Prakriti intertwine themselves and create this world which we experience. Purusha and Prakriti both are beginningless, both are the aspects of Ishwara. So in our cosmology we have Purusha and Prakriti. Both are beginningless, but they are controlled by Ishwara. Ishwara is the Mayapathy.\n\nIshvara is in charge of Maya. So Brahman with Maya becomes Ishwara and Ishwara is the Mayapati with his Maya he controls both the Prakriti and Purusha. Purusha is the knower. The attributes of Purusha we have seen Sat, Chit and Ananda. So Purusha is Sat, existence, Chit, Knowledge and Ananda the Bliss. These are the attributes of Purusha, the knower.\n\nThen Prakriti has three Gunas, Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. Purusha has no Gunas, Prakruti has three Gunas. Purusha is sentient conscious. But interaction with the two create this world that we experience. So that's basically what we have so far learnt in this discussion. The last verse which we have seen which says Purushaha, Prakriti Staha Bhumte Prakriti Janguna.\n\nWhen seated in Prakriti, when intertwined with the Prakriti, it experiences all the gunas of the Prakriti. Karanam Guna, Sangasya Sad Asat, Yoni Janmasu. And attachment to the Gunas is the cause for the birth in good or not so good wombs. In other words, the existence which I experience right now in this life is because of my attachment and avidya to the Gunas in my past life. Maybe two years before or before my birth. What I'm experiencing today is because of my attachment to the gunas of the Prakriti.\n\nBecause as the Purusha adopted all the Gunas so Purusha coming in contact with the Prakriti. All the gunas of the Prakriti are superimposed on the Purusha Purushas. All the attributes get superimposed in the Prakriti. So Prakriti experience the Satchit and Ananda. That's why we experience the sense of existence. And also we experience Sukha and Dukha as we have seen in this everywhere.\n\nPrakriti on the other hand becomes sentient. Therefore my body becomes sentient, inert body becomes sentient. My mind knows and I also feel that Ananda or Sukharga. So he said Purusha Prante, Prakti. That's the reason we come into being. So we have like three bodies.\n\nThe gross body which everybody can see. The subtle body which is the internal instrument, the mind Buddhi Chitta Nahanka and the causal body which is the cause for both these bodies to come into existence. Which is my left Tor Vasanas, leftover desires which is what we learned in this previous chapter. The leftover impressions and desires prompt me to take birth in this particular situation. So these two bodies come into existence because of the past Karma Bhagavan Sangha is Sat Karma Janyam. Because of your good actions you achieve this gross and subtle body in this life.\n\nAnd then he said, how this Pratibimba I think Jina, your question was is there anything reflecting? And Bhagavan Sankaraja Satupa directly answered that question saying Sthula Sarira Abhimani Jiva Namakam Brahmaprati Bambam Bhavati Sa Eva Jivaha Prakritya Swasmat Iswaram Binnat Vena Janati. So it says that the reflection of Brahman, the all pervading Almighty consciousness which is immutable undividable. Its reflection occurs in the internal instrument of that being. That being now receives the impressions reflection of the Brahman. And that is called Jiva.\n\nNow this Brahman as the Purusha reflecting in the internal instrument of individual ego is called Jiva. So it's called Jivaatma atma. The self or the soul, it's called Jiva atma. This Jiva by nature of ignorance consider itself to be different from the Ishvara. This is where we not experience the almightiness of Ishvara. The consciousness which we have is nothing but the Buddhist all pervading Purusha's consciousness.\n\nThe Purusa as my soul has the same nature as the Brahman which is of Sat, Chit and Ananda. So this Sat aspect gives me the sense of existence. The Cheetah aspect gives me the sense of knowing. That's why I know myself, I know the world around me. I know my relationships that comes from that. And Ananda that I experience Sukhendukha in my life.\n\nSo this reflection is in my internal instrument. This internal instrument is right now not clean enough. It is also reflecting all other things of Prakriti. So this is more like if I am sitting in a dark room and suddenly light comes on and I see there are mirrors all around me. In that mirror not only I see myself but I also see everything in the room. Now not only I recognize myself in in the mirror but I also recognize everything in the room and I start identifying with them.\n\nSo the internal instrument not only reflects the Purusha, it also reflecting the world of objects. All the sensory perceptions we get, we get the sensation through our senses on the internal instrument. The internal instrument is like a mirror or like a film in a camera. It captures everything which comes to it whether it's a Purusha or the world of objects. It captures all the images. That sensation creates perception in the mind.\n\nThen the mind asks the intellect to interpret and it creates conception. That's how we conceive thoughts, we conceive ideas, we conceive things outside. So Bhagawan Shankaracharya says it is the Brahman reflecting in your internal instruments become your individual ego. But I don't recognize it the same as Ishvara. Purusha with the Upadi of Maya becomes Ishwara Purusha with the Upadi of ignorance. In my case same Purusha superimposed by the ignorance, he becomes Jiva, the individual soul conditioned consciousness in case of Lord, unconditioned consciousness superimposed by Maya, by creativity.\n\nWhy Bhagavan creates the world? Because it is the very nature of that Purusha. So with that we'll go to the next verse. So next verse says, even though I see that as the cause for my birth in this Sansar, but this supreme Purusa in me, the reflection of the Brahman which I consider to be my limited self, also can be seen as Upadrista, Anumanta, Chabharta, Loka, Maheshwaraha, Paramatma, Iticha, opi Uktaha, dehe Ashmin, Purushah, Paraha, that Purushahaparaha, the supreme Purusha. In this body, the same supreme being which is everywhere, also in the same body. I call myself a Jiva.\n\nAn individual ego also is called Upadrasta, the onlooker. Because it is not really taking any part in the activities of my body, mind and intellect. This gross body, this subtle mind and intellect, they're functioning all the time. They are empowered by consciousness, consciousness not taking part in it. Therefore it is also called Upadrasta, onlooker, anumantacha. So that onlooker does not really discriminate between the good activity or bad activities.\n\nBut when my mind is thinking something higher, something nobler, something greater, he also becomes permitter. He allows me to act in that particular manner which will help me in my evolution. When I act in that manner, he becomes Bharata, the supporter of my activities and my evolution. He also becomes Bhokta. He also become the enjoyer of those actions. So this Purusha in me is a witness.\n\nHe also permits all the things which I do, good or evil. But when it is good, it allows me to grow, then also makes me enjoy those fruits of actions. He is also called Maheshwarah because he is no different than the Great Lord himself. Therefore he is also called Maheshwara. Maheshwara the Great Lord himself and Paramatma in the supreme soul. But looking from the different perspective, when I grow out of my ignorance that I am this body, I am this mind intellect, then I see him as the same Lord Paramatma.\n\nI see him as Maheshwara, the Great Ishwara. So there is no difference between the Lord outside and Lord within me. Therefore, Bhagawan Shankaracharya says this should not be accepted. That Jiva and Paramatma are two different entities. It is one and the same, seen from two different perspectives, one through the lens of ignorance and Other through the lens of knowledge. Sa evam vitti purusam prakritim cha gunaihi saha sarvatha vartamano PI nasabuyo abhijayate.\n\nSuch a person who knows Purusha and Prakruti in their real nature, he knows that nature Purusha is satchit and Ananda. It never gets tainted by Prakruti's gunas. But Prakruti's gunas are superimposed on the Purusha when it comes in contact with it. We have heard example in Brahma sutras that if you take a iron ball and put it in fire, each will give its own gunas to the other. So the fire which is red hot, now the ball looks red hot. So the fire attributes are now on the iron ball.\n\nAnd the fire which was formless, now you can see the round shape. Because that ball was round, you see the red hot ball of iron. So each gives its own attributes to the other when they come in contact with each other. So in this case also that we have seen that the Prakrudin Purusa gives each other their own attributes. One who knows that that they remain separate. They seem to be associated with each other.\n\nThey seem to be taking each other's gunas, but they remain separate Gunehi Saha including the gunas, Sarvatha, Varsamanoapi. No matter what situation or condition that person is, he doesn't take the next board. And this is somewhat of a difficult concept because it basically says all my actions in the past and present and future get nullified when I get this knowledge. So there are some technical arguments made here that what happens to the actions which I have performed in the past which are Sanchita Karma? So the actions are three types. Sanchida Karma, Agami Karma and Prarabdha Karma.\n\nPrarabdha Karmas are which I am experiencing right now. The past actions mature today as my circumstances. I went to architecture school. I'm an architect now. That's a Prarabdhyakarna. So if a Gnani becomes knowledgeable about this, do all his karmas get nullified?\n\nAnd the answer is no. He will continue to experience the Prarabdha Karma which I have matured now in this life. So you will still live this life. But then this Sanchita Karma which accumulated actions which are not yet matured, they get roasted so they never will fructify. And Agame Karma, which I will perform now onward, will have no Meaning because it does not create any more vasanas in me. We have realized that I am not this limited being.\n\nAnd therefore I don't associate any of the gunas of the body, mind and intellect, even though body, mind and intellect continue to function as they were before. Therefore, these verses say, such a person, at the end of the exhaustion of this life, he will not take the birth again. So I'll leave it to you how you take it. But that's exactly what this verse says. The next verse says how people achieve the state of knowledge, that all the accumulated actions get burned. Prarabdha Karma means nothing because I don't really see myself as the enjoyer, sufferer, as a limited being.\n\nAnd no actions in the future will make and any difference. Some highly qualified seekers, seekers of liberation, seekers of ultimate happiness, those who are highly qualified, they will achieve this by contemplation.",
      "reflection": "Today, practice distinguishing the field from the knower of the field. When emotions arise, notice: 'This is happening in the field, and I am aware of it.' When thoughts arise, the same.\n\nYou are not your thoughts, not your emotions, not your body. You are that which is aware of all these. This simple shift in identification—from the observed to the observer—is the beginning of liberation.\n\nPay attention to the moments when you forget this distinction and get lost in experience. Can you notice the moment of forgetting? The moment of remembering?"

      "commentary": "What is my purpose and destiny? So we have been discussing chapter 13, Kshatrakshatragna Vibhagyoga yoga of discrimination between the field and its Knower. This is most analytical chapter in Bhagavad Gita. It literally summarizes the whole philosophy of Vedanta. The goal of this chapter is to differentiate between the self and the non self, the field and its knower. So what we have seen so far, Bhagavan has clearly defined the field, clearly defined who the knower of the field is.\n\nWe know that every being has his own or her own consciousness. But we consider that to be different from each other. In the very beginning of the chapter, Bhagawan changed that paradigm and said, the Kshetragna is only one, the pure Consciousness, the Supreme Self. Supreme Being is the Kshetragna in all the field. He is the Knower of the field in all the fields. Which is where we basically have to now reconcile this parallax that we have that we consider that this Knower of the field in me, the Knower that I am, is different than the Knower in other people.\n\nSo Babi basically started this chapter with that premise that Knower is only one. Now we have learnt in previous chapters that Bhagawan described that his nature. In chapter 8 he describes his nature that I have my lower Prakriti and my Higher Prakriti. And in that we have learned that the lower Prakriti is the manifest world that we see. And the Higher Prakriti is the Unmanifest consciousness which is functioning through this Prakriti. And we discussed that Bhagavan as Isvara is both the efficient cause and the material cause for this world, the creation as we perceive through our senses.\n\nThis world is a creation which I can perceive through my senses and vouch for it, that it exists, the world exists. These two existences that I can vouch for the creation which is an effect. I myself is an effect, the world is an effect. So there got to be a Creator. So you have Come to the conclusion that there must be one Creator who created this universe including my own self, including my own being. That self did not have any other source of material.\n\nSo he could not buy, borrow or steal material from any other source. Therefore, the only material available to him was his own self. So he created this Jagat out of his own self and so is my own being. Therefore myself cannot be separate, cannot be different from his self. Because the material provided for this Jagat is nothing Bhatt the Bhagwant oneself. In Sankhya philosophy we have seen it is described in a different way.\n\nPurusha and Prakriti. Purusha is the efficient cause and Prakriti is the material cause. Prakriti provides the material. Purusha is the consciousness agency which provide the efficient cause. Then we have discussed the Vedanta goes one step further. It says both the efficient cause, which is Purusha and Prakriti which is the material cause, are expression of the same entity, Brahman.\n\nThis Prakriti is created out of Maya. That appearance, there is no actual mutation took place in the self of that great Paramatma. But it appears to have mutated into this Prakriti, the world of plurality, so that we have understood intellectually. And if you take that argument, there is no difference between your Atma yourself, which you consider your consciousness is different than the Paramatma, the Supreme Being. And now what we are discussing is how that Supreme Being relates to the Prakriti. So the last few verses which we have seen is now concluding verses because we have seen in the few verses before this, how to recognize their Paramatma which is immutable, which is neither Sat nor Asat.\n\nThese are some recognized by Dhyanam, some by Karma Yoga, some by just listening. Depending on your own capabilities, you can choose the path which is the most appropriate for you to recognize that Myself, the Atma which I consider my own being, is the same as Paramatma. And then Bhagavan now concluding this topic by saying Yavatsanchate kincit satvam Savara Jangamam. Wherever you see any creation in this Jagat, know that the field and its knower has come together. Without the knower and the field come together, there is no creation. It is like in quantum physics.\n\nThey say the particle only exists when somebody detects it. Unless there is an observer, the particle may be in a form of a probability wave. As soon as there is a detector, either individual or mechanical, the particle will manifest as particle. So unless There is knower, there is no field. And if there is field, there has to be a knower of that field. The two exist is a mutual existence.\n\nSo Bhagawan said, whenever there is a creation, both have to be there. Efficient cause and material cause. They both have to be present in that creation. So no O Bharatara Sabha, wherever there is creation, there are both material cause and efficient cause. Purusha Efficient cause, Prakriti material cause. However you should know.\n\nBhagavan said Samam Sarveshu puteshu tishthandam Parameshwaram Right now because of my own Ahankar Aham kartru Ahankar which says I am so unique that the paramatma in me is very unique than all other beings. The atma in all other being, devoking the animals to be inferior than usual and even the worms are inferior than anything else. So this notion that I have the great evaluation of my own self is a myth. This myth has to go away for me to recognize the paramatma. The myth which I have created in my own mind that I am unique and everybody else is just normal. We are normal beings of this world.\n\nBut I myself is very unique. One who says the same Atma, same paramatma is atma in all beings. Vinasyatsu or Vinasyantam Yah Pasyati sah Pashyati. Right now I am seeing this world through my physical senses, through my eyes, through my understanding of my limited sense perception. The sense perception has created the conception in my mind about what the world is and what my being is. But after getting the wisdom of this reality, Bhagavan said, one who starts seeing that, that immutable imperishable paramatma which is the Purusha functioning is the knower of the field.\n\nIn each field is not different from each other or each other. Knowers in this field. So he does not see this atma to be destructible in any being. Yah Pashyati Sah Pashyati Manu sees that indestructible atma in all perishable things and beings. I see things and beings all around me which are perishable in a sense. It has beginning date and end date.\n\nOr anything that which I see in the world, including the stars and galaxies. They all have beginning date and end date. Changing the world around me is constantly changing. I myself is constantly changing. My body is changing, my mind is changing, my intellect is changing. But I am the witness of these changes in me.\n\nSo I must be different than the changes which are occurring in me the same way the world which is changing. The knower of this universe must be changeless just as I remain changeless throughout my existence as this limited being from my childhood to these old days. He said, one who sees that he is the wise person. Sammam paschenhi sarvatra sam avasthitam ishwaram na hinashyati atmanaatmanam tatoyati paramgatim. One who sees Ishwara exists pervading an all being, a same Ishwara. He does not destroy the self by by the self and therefore he achieves the higher state of existence.\n\nHe becomes one with that. We have seen this before. We Learned in chapter 6 in verse 5 Bhagawan I said uttarat atmana tmanam na tmanam ausaade. Lift yourself by yourself, don't let yourself fall. So we already learned at least six chapters ago. There are two selves in me.\n\nOne which is identified with this limited being, the limited self which is conditioned consciousness. That limited self is constantly getting the guidance from the higher self which is the paramatma. My own conscience, my own antaratma which guides me all the time. I know before I do anything whether it is right or wrong. My antaratna will tell me. My conscience will tell me whether I'm on a right path or not.\n\nI know this market is very hot and everybody is putting money in it. Maybe I should back out. But I'm not going to back out because I don't want to lose out. What if market continues to go up? Even though my antaratma said this is not the right way to go about in this market. I'll go and do it anyway.\n\nThe Bhagawan saying that you have let yourself down by your own self, not listening to the higher self. The Bhagawan has advised us that don't let your lower self fall by not listening to your higher self with constant guidance from the higher self. Because I'm always connected even though I am not aware of it. Just the conditioned space in the room is always connected with the universal space outside. There was never a division between the room space and the space outside. It is only in my mind that I see that as limited space.\n\nTherefore I call this room space. All the things which I consider the attributes of the room space are actually those attributes are of the conditioning of the room, the walls, the length, width, height, the contamination or the room is clean or dirty. I call it A room space. But what I'm describing is the conditioning of that room. The same way Bhagavan said. When I identify with this conditioning, the node of the field becomes limited.\n\nThat is the ahamkartru, the ahankar. When it reflects the consciousness, it itself think it is consciousness. That consciousness is now reflecting the limitations of the condition in the body, mind and intellect. Just as the room space is now reflecting the limitations of the room. How wide it is, how long it is, how tall it is. All those are attributes of the conditioning, not of the space.\n\nSo Bhagwante samam pashanhi sarvatra sam avasthitam Ishwaram. One who sees this Ishwara pervading all knowers of these fields. He does not destroy the higher self by the lower self. By completely identifying with the lower self, I'm literally disassociating myself from the higher self. If I completely identify myself as the body, mind, intellect and say this is it. Runam krutva gurutumbibet yavad jeevet Sukam jeevet.\n\nEven if you incur death, drink ghee, live happily. After this body is burnt, there is no coming back. So leave as comfortably as you can by whatever means. There is one type of philosophy which is Charvak Darshan, one of the schools of thought in our Indian philosophy. But once again if you are abiding to that thought then you have completely negated the existence of the higher self. You disassociated yourself with Sahara self.\n\nYou are not recognizing the existence of the higher self. That is killing your higher self by yourself identifying with the non self. This ego is not the self. This thinking entity. This thinking entity is inert and cannot think unless it is energized by the Purusha's presence, the sentience in me. But the ego starts thinking.\n\nThese are the qualities of mind. And therefore I am the Almighty for my world and I do not need any higher guidance. He says such a person kills the higher self by the lower self and he does not see the real truth. One who does not do that, he achieves the higher state of existence. Prakruti evacha Karmani Kriyamanani Sarvasah. One who sees that all actions are being performed within the Prakriti by the Prakriti and Atma.",

      "commentary": "In studying Bhagavad Gita, we have seen that the Bhagavad Gita divided into three parts describing Tattvamasi, that thou art thou, that is you, as you are that which is the Lord which you are seeking in the one. They both are one and the same. So in the first six chapters we have talked about you as we are today. Next six chapter we talked about the identity of the Lord. But then how do we reconcile that they both are one and the same? So the chapter 13 onward is an explanation of how these two are one and the same.\n\nMyself and this supreme self are not two different cells, but just one and the same. So the chapter 13 started with saying how this differentiation come in our perception, in our understanding of I and the world, the duality created between myself in everything other than that which I consider myself. So the chapter 13 we have seen Kshetra, Kshetragna, Vibhaga Yoga. The differentiation that is created in my understanding between the field and its knower and the differentiation right now is very clear. I am the knower of the world that I know and world is my field of actions. This chapter takes it a one notch higher and said Idham Shariram Kaunteya Itikshetram.\n\nThis which I consider as a knower right now is actually part of the field. This body is the field and one who knows the body is the knower. So we took it to one more subtler level. The definition which I know intuitively that I am the knower and the world is my field. So now I have included my body as part of the world and I the knower, remains somewhat other than this body. Then we also include the mind and intellect and all my emotions into it.\n\nYou know, all the vikaras, the modifications of this field, all my emotions into it, my experiences into it. Then what is left who is aware of everything is the knower. The field is where all the activity is taking place. We have also defined it in a different way Prakriti and Purusha. So now we know there are two entities which constitute my world. My world is the world of the matter, the field in which all the activity is taking place.\n\nThe one who knows and feels the results and the reactions of this activity at my micro, cosmic level, at my level, when I'm identified with this field, what I consider my body, my mind, my intellectual. The one who is aware of this and identifying with it, he becomes the enjoyer or sufferer of the activities taken place by my mind, my intellect and my body. So is applicable to all bodies, minds and intellects. And then Bhagawan said, both the field and the knower of the field are beginningless. You can think about when did this started? The question obviously, legitimately, is why and when?\n\nWhen this ignorance started about myself that I am not the Supreme Self, and why? The answer is given in a way which requires more contemplation. But it basically says they both are beginningless. There's not really a beginning that one day Bhagavan says, well, let there be Prakriti and let them suffer through it. They're beginningless because they are the very nature of the Lord and therefore the both the Prakriti and Purusha are the nature of the Lord as we have seen in previous chapter and say my higher Prakriti and my lower Prakriti. My lower Prakriti is the manifest world and my higher Prakriti is the one which supports this lower Prakriti makes this Lower Prakriti function is my higher Prakriti.\n\nIn this chapter we have seen it in different ways. Purusha is the one, the subtler, the higher unmanifest self. And the Prakriti is the most manifest self which we can say. So both are beginningless because they are the very nature of the supreme, the Brahman. Anything which has a cause becomes an effect. Every effect has its qualities.\n\nThis qualities makes it perishable. And therefore they remain in time and space for a time. As long as the qualities are attributed to that, it has a cause and it has a timeline. But something which is beginningless obviously cannot have any qualities. Therefore the Brahman does not have any qualities. And therefore it has no cause.\n\nAnd if there is no cause, it is beginningless. If this Prakriti and Purusha are the two aspect of the supreme, they both are beginningless. So we started with this basic understanding. Then he said, if that's the case, then obviously all hands are his, all mouths are his so anywhere or any place where a thing or a being is coming into existence that because of of the union between these two, the Prakriti and Purusha, the creation only takes place of anything or a being. When this to the Prakruti and Purusha, the field and its knower come together. If there is no knower, there is no field.\n\nAnd if there is no field, there is no knower. As long as I consider myself a being, a living being, as long as one, I have this body, mind and intellect. And secondly, I'm aware of it. If I'm not aware of it, do I really exist? Therefore the question do you really exist in deep sleep? I know I exist in a waking world.\n\nI know I exist in a dream as a dreamer. But do I really exist in my deep sleep? Because I'm not aware of myself. But I am very aware of myself even though I'm not aware of my body, mind, intellect. Therefore I wake up and say I had a good sleep. If I'm not aware of myself, I wouldn't be able to say that.\n\nTherefore I say I exist even in my deep sleep. I exist as a waker, I exist as dreamer. I also exist as a deep sleeper. As this limited ego, I considered myself. And then Bhagavan takes us to the path where he says, what is knowledge and what is to be known? He said, what is to be known is seated in hearts of all the beings and all the things.\n\nThe core of our being is our awareness about our self that is to be known. Who is that that is aware of my being and that leads me to the knowledge is the knowledge. Everything else other than that is ignorance. So we have seen those several qualities. Amanitvam, Adam, Bitvam. Those qualities lead me to know the knowable in my heart.\n\nSo I say those qualities will take me to knowing the self. Which then will make me aware that my self is no distinct than yourself and herself and himself, but is the one self. Once that understanding takes place, Bhagavan said he achieves the supreme state. How can I get over my limitations? How can I be perennially happy? That state Bhagavan said, you will achieve when you will understand that this self in me is the self which is seated in all hearts, moving or unmoving.\n\nThat is the core, the essence of all the beings. And then Bhagavan said that many, many people have recognized this self through many different paths. Dhyana, Yoga, Karma Yoga, Gnan Yoga, Bhakti Yoga. You see, there are various paths. People have attained this knowledge about their own self and in turn got the knowledge of the paramatma. But some may not even be capable of following any path.\n\nBut just having the faith in somebody's words, they have attained this just having that faith that no. Because my guru told me oh such and such person too. And having pursued that, they also achieved that last few verses that what is the test where I can consider myself that I have come to know this thing. Tamam Pasyanhi Sarvatra sama Avesthitam Ishwaram. One who starts seeing that the Ishvara my Lord is sitting equally in all hearts is present everywhere equally. And therefore I'm not negating the supreme self by my small self Right now I've already negated.\n\nI only consider this is me. Nothing other than this I consider me that's not me, that's not me, that's not me, that's not me. In Bhagavanje once I say this is all me, I'm not negated even though I'm aware of this limited self. But I'm also aware that this extension of this world is nothing but me alone. Just as the example we have seen, this conditioned room space was never separated from the space outside. Right now I'm aware of this conditioned space in that this is room space.\n\nBut also if I have a reason which says the room space and the space is one and the same, then I truly have the knowledge of the space. Last few verses expands on this idea that I'm constantly aware of both my existence. My existence has this limited ego as the conditioned self as this body, mind and intellect. But the same time aware of my existence as the supreme self. So the last few verses we have seen last time say Anaditvat nirgunat tvat paramatma Ayam avyaha sarirasthobi karnataya nakarotti na lipyate. This paramatma, this self of mind at its greater level is anaditvat nirguna tvat it being without beginning and being devoid of all qualities, my this limited self has beginning in the end I was born and I will die.\n\nOr you can say wherever my ego started many births ago. And once I realized that this conditioned self is none other than that beginningless and nirgunathvat I have all the qualities right now the nice person, not so nice. All these things are qualities of my body, mind and intellect which I perceive one way and the world perceives one way and other way. But he Said, these qualities are not the qualities of myself. These are qualities of my conditioning, the Prakriti. The Prakriti is my manifest self has the qualities.\n\nBut my real self which is knowing this Prakriti has no qualities. Because as I said the Bhagavan, the self has no cause and therefore it is beginningless. And because it is beginningless and no cause, it cannot have any qualities which makes it limited. Therefore, knowing that the Paramatma which is immutable, imperishable is beginningless and qualityless. And so is the nature of myself. And therefore, though it is seated in my heart, in this body, as the propeller for this body to perform actions, it is not doing anything.\n\nNo actions are being performed by myself. All actions are performed by the qualities of the Prakriti. Therefore, in Gujarati there is a this saying Prana, Prakriti sate jai. The Prana, Prana and the Prakriti both goes together. Nothing goes first or nothing goes later. In other words, my inherent nature will not change no matter what happens.\n\nI cannot suddenly become interested in boxing or wrestling because my inherent nature is not to be in that. So Bhagavan said Sarira sthope kante. Even though it seems he is seated in this heart and propelling this body, mind and intellect to act. The acts are only performed by this body, mind and intellect and belong to them alone. As long as this conditioned self is identifying with, suffers and it enjoys when that identification is removed there is no suffering or enjoyment because of the actions of this body. So therefore he says Nakaroti, he is not doing anything na lipyade he is not affected by it.\n\nThe next verse says, Yathas sarvagatam sukshmit akasham na upalipyade sarvatra avasthito dehe tata atman. The just as and I use very conveniently as an architect the space. But even they use the same justice because of its subtle nature. The space is not it says Akasha.",
      "reflection": "Today, practice distinguishing the field from the knower of the field. When emotions arise, notice: 'This is happening in the field, and I am aware of it.' When thoughts arise, the same.\n\nYou are not your thoughts, not your emotions, not your body. You are that which is aware of all these. This simple shift in identification—from the observed to the observer—is the beginning of liberation.\n\nPay attention to the moments when you forget this distinction and get lost in experience. Can you notice the moment of forgetting? The moment of remembering?"

      "commentary": "We have completed chapter 13 and started discussing chapter 14. So in the last chapter we have very exhaustively discussed the relationship of the nature and the knower of the Nature, the Prakriti and Purusha, the field and its knower, that we have seen that both are Anadi, both are beginningless. But all these activities take place in Prakriti. The self remains inactive, it becomes a witness, but its very presence makes it possible. All the activities, this field and its Knower, when come together, then only a creation comes into place. If there is a field but there is no knower, or the knower but there is no field, both cannot exist because field of the Knower only exists because there is a field and the field only exists because the Knower is there.\n\nSo this superimposition filled in its knower creates this world of plurality as we know. But it never really explained to us why this plurality, in other words, why this variety. We know that the Prakriti is beginningless. We know the Purusha is beginningless. Both are, even in terms of there is no difference in Prakriti here or Prakriti there. There is no difference between an over here and over there.\n\nThen what is that causes all this world of plurality and the variations and modifications that we see that I am different than you are, you are different than you is. This chapter deals with that aspect of it, knowing that Prakriti is all pervading and even everywhere, so is the Knower. But the qualities of this Prakriti which creates this variety, as we know. So this chapter, Yoga of Gunas now talks about the nature of the Prakritis. Because we have seen that there is no activity taking place in the Knower, the self, but all the activities, all the Karmas are the cause and the cause of the Prakriti. The very nature of things and beings creates this activity and this variety.\n\nSo that will be discussed in this chapter. The chapter opens with Lord Krishna's declaration one more time, as he has done many different time before he says parambhuyaha pravakshami Gnananam Gnanamuttamam, I'm going to tell you, I shall again declare to you the supreme knowledge Gnananam Gnanamuttam, the best among all knowledge. What it really means is that we need to constantly keep repeating what is important, what is real and what is unreal. In the last chapter, in a very broad brush, we have seen that how we can disassociate ourselves as the knower from the field that included my body, mind and intellect. That was the paradigm shift for us, that this body, mind and intellect is part of the field. One who knows this body, mind and intellect is the knower of this field.\n\nThat knower is the self. That self is pervading equally among all the beings. However, it never explained then if that's the case, if the knower is the same, he's pervading everywhere. Why there is a variety why I am who I am and you are who you are. So this chapter says, if I know why I am who I am right now, if I have a guide to analyze my own self, I. I can introspect and say what makes me who I am. At times I'm a nice person, at times I'm a very angry man.\n\nAnd at times I'm not so nice. What makes me that not so nice and nice? At various times, if I can have a guide where I can use that as the path to introspect myself, maybe I will have a better chance to understand myself as I exist as the jiva, as the individual ego and then can transcend that individual ego to identify with the self which is all pervading in all of us. Therefore, this knowledge is the most important knowledge among all the knowledges because it allows you to introspect your own self. Yat gnatva munayha sarve param siddham ita gataha. Anytime you have to sell something to somebody, you have to make sure that there is a proof.\n\nYou can't say that nobody has ever heard this before. You are the first guinea pig I'm going to try out on you. And let's see it works. This knowledge was used by many munis Yat gnatma. Knowing this knowledge, they attain the param siddhim, the highest supreme achievement. After going from here, it's pretty complex sometimes and sometimes can be misleading.\n\nIf you don't read between the line, the first one is say ita gathaha. After going from here. So we come to the conclusion that this knowledge will be only beneficial after I die, having been here, may not be possible for me to gain that knowledge. Then yad ginatva munay ha. All the Munis who knowing this, has achieved the supreme state. And we all know that we started out by saying what is the supreme state?\n\nWe are looking for the supreme state where there is no limitation. For me, I am right now suffering from my limitations. I want to get out of these limitations so that I can have eternal bliss. So am I qualified for this? And this thing can misguided and say munihi survey. So we think that all the Muni it is for the Munis.\n\nOur picture of a Muni is as Swamiji says, guy who is in his 70s and 80s, somewhere in Himalayas with white beard and is surviving on just whatever he can gather around in Himalayas. Nothing to do with the Sansar. Swamiji tried to explain to us that Muni is one who is contemplating about his mind. In his mind he's contemplating about his self is a Muni. One who is a seeker of this knowledge is a Muni. As this knowledge becomes more and more clearer to him, Yad gatva this knowledge becomes clearer to him, get closer and closer to his goal.\n\nOnce this knowledge becomes his own, he achieves that final state where there is no limitations. Itaha kathaha after having gone from here, gone from here, from this state of my understanding that this is me, this body, mind and intellect is me. And the workings of my body mind are my doings. And I am the enjoy and suffer. Once that understanding has changed from body, mind and intellect are part of the field. And I am just the observer who makes this body, mind, intellect function.\n\nSo Itah kath going from this stage of identifying with the condition individualized ego which we have seen in the field and it's knower. The knower which identifies with the field becomes the individualized ego knower which identifies with my body, my mind, my intellect, becomes me, the jiva. Once that identification is detached and I see myself as every other self, I become free from that. Itha gath Munihi have come to understand this. The next would say Idam gnanam upashitya mama sa Dharmyam Agathah. So we have two entities right now in our understanding.\n\nOne is me who is eternally suffering. Because anytime I think I have achieved what I want, something else is higher than that which creates. So something gets out of My control. I think I have control all the situations. Then suddenly something gets out of control. We figured out everything is going right.\n\nAnd suddenly we hear that oh my son is not doing son. Somehow I make sure that that side becomes. Then we figure out oh economy has. We try to manage things within our control. But then constantly something is getting out of our control. Then we know that oh, there is someone who has a control over everything that one never have to worry about.\n\nHe doesn't have to compete for jobs with anybody. He is the Lord of all these beings. This too has a complete division. I and him are separate. But my goal is constantly become him. Because my goal is to become without any limitations, without any sorrows.\n\nSo I'm constantly trying to become what I am from what he is. And Bhagavan says, Idam Gnanam Upashatya. One who has taken refuge in this knowledge. The knowledge which he has not given us yet, but he's going to give it to us. He has given us the kind of broad brush understanding of how things work in this. But how to get from here to there, we don't know yet.\n\nBut he says, idam Gnanam Upasatya mama sa Dharma Agathah. One who has taken refuge in the knowledge, they become one with me. Their dharmas have become what my dharmas are. My dharmas are limited. Right now his dharmas are unlimited. From this limitedness to unlimitedness, Bhagavan said, those munis who have understood this knowledge and became one with that knowledge have become one with me.\n\nSadharamyam Agatha API na upa jayante Pralayena Vihanticha. Broad statement for somebody like us who are worried about next paycheck and says that. They do not take birth even at the time of creation. We are saying, look, forget about the creation and Pralaya. I am worried about what's happening tomorrow. But he says, there's such a person Sargiya Pina upa Jayante Pralay na Vyatanti character.\n\nAnd he doesn't get destroyed at the time of Pralaya. Because we are also pretty long term planners. So we say, okay, I mean I do all of that. But then again I'll take a birth and I'll go back to the same thing all over again. I'll realize that I'm that unlimited being. But then I'll take a birth again and then I'll start from scratch all over again.\n\nBhagavad said, no, once you have realized who you are, there Is no birth or death for you. He says, why if that happens, if everybody realizes this, well, obviously there is no creation and there is no Pralaya. So why are we going through all of this again? He says, this is self knowledge. This is for you to get out of the misery which you are going through. You are not worried about what the others are doing.\n\nWe are not taking over his job of creating and destroying. I am only concerned about me. If job market is bad and we have 10 of our friends who are out of job, including yourself, who are you most worried about to get a job? Good luck to all of you. Once I get a job, I get right Others may be what whatever they are doing. Bhagavan may be whatever his goal is in this Pralayas and creation.\n\nI need to get out of this misery. He's the one who has understood this. He will never have to take birth again or die again. Swamiji explains in a logical, philosophical manner. He said, the world keeps on going the way it is. But I understand that this Prakriti is an illusion.\n\nThe creation is a trick of my mind. If there is a lump of clay or a play doh, I make the shape myself and assign value to it, that is to it all. Or it's an elephant or it's whatever it is. Nothing has changed in the plate or the clay itself. But my mind has now assigned a value that it's a creation created by me and I have given a name and form to it. Now if I don't assign the name and form to it and keep seeing the clay as it is, there is no creation taking place.\n\nNow when I take that clay and that elephant would have made and destroy it into lump of clay again, that elephant is destroyed. If I have taken credit for that creation, assigned a name and form to it, but I never assigned a name and form to has remained what it was before. Lump of clay, Prakriti remaining Prakriti and Purusha remaining Purusha.",
      "reflection": "Notice the play of the three gunas in yourself today. When do you feel clear and light (sattva)? When restless and driven (rajas)? When heavy and stuck (tamas)?\n\nDon't judge—just observe. This observation itself is the beginning of freedom from the gunas' grip. The one who watches the gunas is not bound by them.\n\nConsider what activities, foods, relationships, and environments increase sattva in your life. What increases rajas? Tamas? With this awareness, you can make wiser choices."

But he says, there's such a person Sargiya Pina upa Jayante Pralay na Vyatanti character.\n\nAnd he doesn't get destroyed at the time of Pralaya. Because we are also pretty long term planners. So we say, okay, I mean I do all of that. But then again I'll take a birth and I'll go back to the same thing all over again. I'll realize that I'm that unlimited being. But then I'll take a birth again and then I'll start from scratch all over again.\n\nBhagavad said, no, once you have realized who you are, there Is no birth or death for you. He says, why if that happens, if everybody realizes this, well, obviously there is no creation and there is no Pralaya. So why are we going through all of this again? He says, this is self knowledge. This is for you to get out of the misery which you are going through. You are not worried about what the others are doing.\n\nWe are not taking over his job of creating and destroying. I am only concerned about me. If job market is bad and we have 10 of our friends who are out of job, including yourself, who are you most worried about to get a job? Good luck to all of you. Once I get a job, I get right Others may be what whatever they are doing. Bhagavan may be whatever his goal is in this Pralayas and creation.\n\nI need to get out of this misery. He's the one who has understood this. He will never have to take birth again or die again. Swamiji explains in a logical, philosophical manner. He said, the world keeps on going the way it is. But I understand that this Prakriti is an illusion.\n\nThe creation is a trick of my mind. If there is a lump of clay or a play doh, I make the shape myself and assign value to it, that is to it all. Or it's an elephant or it's whatever it is. Nothing has changed in the plate or the clay itself. But my mind has now assigned a value that it's a creation created by me and I have given a name and form to it. Now if I don't assign the name and form to it and keep seeing the clay as it is, there is no creation taking place.\n\nNow when I take that clay and that elephant would have made and destroy it into lump of clay again, that elephant is destroyed. If I have taken credit for that creation, assigned a name and form to it, but I never assigned a name and form to has remained what it was before. Lump of clay, Prakriti remaining Prakriti and Purusha remaining Purusha.",
      "reflection": "Notice the play of the three gunas in yourself today. When do you feel clear and light (sattva)? When restless and driven (rajas)? When heavy and stuck (tamas)?\n\nDon't judge—just observe. This observation itself is the beginning of freedom from the gunas' grip. The one who watches the gunas is not bound by them.\n\nConsider what activities, foods, relationships, and environments increase sattva in your life. What increases rajas? Tamas? With this awareness, you can make wiser choices."

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 14, Gunatraya Vibhaga Yoga, the Yoga of Trigunas. We had just completed the Kshetrakshatragna Vibhaga, the differentiation between the field and its knower. We have seen that this world of ours is made up of two things. One is the field and its knower. In my case, I the knower of my world. And then we have also seen at the macro level, it's a Purusha and Prakriti, two entities which makes this manifest world apparent to me.\n\nPrakriti is the nature, the manifest world, and Purusha, the unmanifestation which is making this Prakriti animated. So this understanding of Purushana Prakriti is. Now we can use it to our understanding. As Bhagawan says, we can only understand it if we know the nature of this Prakriti. Prakriti, even in our vernacular language, for anybody's inherent qualities in nature, that's his Prakriti. Also in Gujarati they are saying, I'm sure it's another language though.\n\nPranayani, Prakruti, Sathya Jay, that this breath and my quality, they go together, they remain embedded in me. So knowing this Prakriti can certainly be a big help in my spiritual quest of knowing myself. So this chapter talks about Gunatraya, the three Gunas of the Prakriti. Prakriti, that is me as this body, mind and intellect. This world as I see and it's all pervading, just as the nature of the Brahman is. And as we have said, both the Purusha and Prakriti are beginningless because both are the nature of Brahman, which is beginningless.\n\nSomething which is beginningless in whatever format it is presented remains beginningless. Therefore, Prakriti is beginningless. Purusha is beginningless. In my quest of understanding myself, myself is beginningless. Where did I create this misunderstanding that I'm limited and I'm going through these ups and downs in my life? I'm Going through these sorrows and happiness, the spurts of little happiness and then long period of pursuit of happiness.\n\nBhagavan said that understanding this nature of this Prakriti will be helpful. Bhagawan said, I am the Mahat Yoni Brahman. I, the Brahman in the form of a Prakriti is the womb of all the beings. No being or thing can come into existence unless the Purusha and Prakriti come together. So see, anywhere you see a thing or being coming into existence, consider that as the union of the Purusha and Prakarati, that unmanifest and manifest coming together creates a new creation. Wherever there is a birth taking place, consider that it is coming from my womb, the universal womb.\n\nAnd then you say, I am the Sid giver, Father. Prakriti is the womb and Purusha is the father. Therefore, in our all vernacular language is Mother Nature, Mother Earth. And Bhagavan is Pita. Bhagavan is my father. Prakriti is my mother, comes directly from this verse from Bhagavad Gita.\n\nSo this nature, the mother nature, when it comes to me, creates this body, mind and intellect. When I was born, what I was born with is this body which continues to grow and decay. Born with this mind and intellect, which obviously at the rudimentary level when I was born with the intellect and grew into who I think I am today. What is the nature of this Prakriti, if I know, will help me to understand who I am. So the next three verses tells us the nature of the Prakritiensi. Swattam Rajah, Tama, iti, Gunaha, Prakriti, Sambhavah.\n\nThe three Gunas which we see in this world, in almost everything that we can observe, are Sattva, rajas and Tamas. They are born out of Prakriti. This manifest world becomes manifest because of these Gunas. You take these three gunas away and there is no world. Manifest world remains. So what is the first Sattvam of a purity, Awareness, knowledge, luminosity.\n\nA thing comes into existence when for me, when I become aware of it. We went to a cruise about two years ago and we realized at the last minute that we need some cash on the cruise. So I went to the ATM because it was Sunday. Well, my car just won't work. So I finally called my client in Baltimore. Mike, can you have $300 in cash for me?\n\nI'll give you a check when I come there. So anyway, he has crisp $100, three notes ready for me, envelopes and Neel Butt. I went there, I collected it, gave check to him and went to a cruise. We never used that money. It was sealed in that envelope since we came and we forgot all about it. Those $300 never existed for us for all this time.\n\nBecause we all forgot about it. Opened it with $300 in it. We are suddenly $300 richer. They did not exist for us. So now Mina said, I gave you that $200. What did you do with it?\n\nWell I said I have it. I'll give it back to you if you want. That money came into existence when I became aware of it. Mina became aware of it. Till that time it did not exist. Sattvam, unless you are aware of this world, world does not come into existence for you.\n\nSo is for her, for him and everybody else. We all become unaware of this world. So Satvam is the first quality of Prakriti. In this nature we are aware of each other and therefore we exist for each other. Next is Rajas and third is Thomas. We heard it many, many many times before.\n\nBut he said they are Prakriti Sambhavah. These Kunas are born out of Prakriti. My Prakriti is I become aware of my world. This experience of this world create passion and desires in me. Passion creates desire, desire creates actions, actions create reactions. And my world continues with cause and effect.\n\nSomebody comes and says you should be investing money right now because market is down. Then suddenly my desire to make money also. Neel, you need to do something And I start doing things. That creates another chain reaction when market drops. So Rajas is the activity which is the nature of cause and effect. My interaction in this Prakriti because of my passion creates activity.\n\nThis activity creates the experience of joys and sorrows. I pat my back and say I'm so smart. When everybody's thinking this, I was doing this. Then when things go bad I said well people really cheated me. They should have told me and tamaha inertia. If we don't have inertia we don't even exist.\n\nTo exist something in time and space it has to have inner share. It has to remain in that condition in time and space for other to experience it. I am real because I have inertia. I remain in that state in time and space for others to experience it. So the inertia is the essential part of Prakriti. Tamas is the very essential quality of Prakriti.\n\nJust as Sattva and rajas. If you take one of the three out, Prakriti does not exist. Sattva cannot exist if there is no rajas and Tamas. There is nothing to be aware of. Rajas cannot exist if there is no inertia. But because there is inertia, Tamas, all three continue to work with each other.\n\nSo this Tamas is the nature of inertia, which at my level I relate to, is my sleep, deep sleep. When I really don't want to do anything, somebody says, oh, let's go and have a party. Forget about it, I'm not in a mood today. I'm overwhelmed by the Tamas. If I'm very sleepy and you tell me I don't want to do that, well, forget about it. Right now all I want to do is sleep.\n\nThat means I am overwhelmed by Tamas. And all I want to do is go back to my basic nature with iti, Gunaha, Prakruti, Sambhavaha, they are part of the Prakruti. They are nature of the Prakruti. They are embedded into the Prakruti. Swamiji says, but they are not like qualities of a material where you can say if I test in the lab, I will find this Sattvaraja Santama. They're actually the moods of my mind when I interact with this Prakriti.\n\nSo sometimes my mind is overwhelmed by Sattva. Things starts getting clearer to me. I tried very hard yesterday, couldn't figure out. This morning it suddenly came to me, aha, moment, Eureka moment. Because the predominant Sattva, Rajas, now I figured out I need to do something. And Tamas, this is enough.\n\nI need to go to sleep. There is always a time, no matter how a dynamic person is, he has to take rest. Ithiguna, Prakritisam, Nibadnanti Mahabhaho, Dehe Dehi, nam Avyayaam, this imperishable self, the Purusha Brahman which is imperishable, is now bound by this perishable body, by these three gunas, the Purusha coming in contact with the Prakriti and get attached to this Prakriti. Gunas get bound by this Prakriti. So this dehi in me, my consciousness which is the nature of all pervading, imperishable nature. Once it attaches to this body, mind and intellect and enjoys the gunas, it gets bound.\n\nSo now I consider this is me, the body. This is me the intellect. Only possible because the consciousness tells me that's who I am. This imperishable one is now bound in this body by these three gunas. Tatra, satvam, nirmalatva, Prakasakam, anamayam, Sukha, sangena, badnati, gnar, sange. My mind under the influence of these three gunas binds me to this body, this mind and this intellect.\n\nSo what is the nature of it? Now I want to unbound myself so that I can realize my imperishable self. That's the quest we have. So that I will have infinite happiness, unlimited happiness which I'm seeking. So I have to unbound myself. So I have to see what is binding me and how.\n\nSo the first is Sattva Tatra Sattvm nirmalatva, Prakashakam annamayam. So nature of this atva is prakashakam. Suddenly becomes things clearer to me. Before I walk into this room at night, it's dark. Nothing is clear what's in the room. Suddenly I switch the light on.\n\nEverything becomes completely clear because it is luminous. That's the nature of sattva in my chitta, in my mind. When once Sattva prevails, things start getting clearer to me. So it's the nature of luminosity and annamayam. Eat some sattvic food. You tell Panditji this.\n\nYou know cholesterol and all the pure ghee. That's good for you, Sattva. So purity is of nature, of health. When I am completely in tune with myself, I feel healthy and I feel aware. Everything seems nice which is the experience of happiness and joy. That's what binds me to this prakriti.\n\nWhen I feel I am in command, I understand things. I am enjoying this knowledge. When I learn something, it binds me to knowledge and the happiness of getting knowledge. Sukha sangena badnadi. So it binds me to happiness. Gnana sangena cha anagaha.\n\nSattva binds me to the knowledge and happiness. It's still a bondage. No matter how golden the chain is, it's still a bondage. Therefore, lot of other saints have argued about this. Vedanti says this and we say harina janato Muktina magya. Whoever the Gujarati fellows can understand he says the God's people they do not want this liberation.\n\nThey want birth after birth. So that I enjoy your bhakti. Because if I'm not there, how can I enjoy your bhakti? Therefore Harina Jina Muktina Mangi Mangi Jana Vi Janavata. I want birth after birth so that I can devote myself to you. Bondage to this Sattva?\n\nThis experience of my devotion to my Lord is giving me happiness and ecstasy. I don't want to give it up. Just keep me in this state. Don't take me to the next one. Otherwise I will lose this ecstasy. He is a man of dynamic personality.\n\nHe worked 18 hours a day.",

When heavy and stuck (tamas)?\n\nDon't judge—just observe. This observation itself is the beginning of freedom from the gunas' grip. The one who watches the gunas is not bound by them.\n\nConsider what activities, foods, relationships, and environments increase sattva in your life. What increases rajas? Tamas? With this awareness, you can make wiser choices."

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 14, Gunatraya Vibhaga Yoga. So we have seen so far that these three gunas are born out of Prakriti. They are actually the nature of Prakriti. The nature gets it from Maya, as Vedanta says. Then Bhagavan Sankaratabodha says three Gunatmika Maya. This Maya has three gunas.\n\nThat which is not but appears to be, that is Maya. So this Maya which creates this illusion that this world is real creates by these three qualities which bind our mind. How do we see hologram? The question is the hologram real? Hologram has its own reality. However, it is not what appears to be.\n\nIf I see a hologram of a woman, hologram is real, but the woman is not. So from that perspective, is this Prakriti real? Prakriti is very real, but it is not what it appears to be. We have all learnt in physics by this time that the atom which appears to be solid and no real solid matter in it whatsoever, but it is very real from my perspective because it is a relative reality. So Bhagavan says in this chapter that all the beings which are born in this world are basically are born from the womb of Mother Nature, Prakriti. And I, this consciousness, I, the self, supreme self, Purusha is, is the seed giving father.\n\nThe entire Prakriti and entire creation that we know is born of the same entity, the self. The Purusha is the father and the Prakriti. The nature as we know is the mother. This Prakriti has three gunas which bind the Purusa into the Prakriti. This union between the Prakruti and Purusha happens because three gunas in the Prakriti. And when that occurs, a being is born.\n\nAn ego is conditioned. Consciousness is conditioned, as we have seen in this analogy, a room space. When a building is built, it binds this space into it and the association creates a room Space. The same way Bhagavan said Purusha came in contact with Prakriti, a conditioned ego is born. Three gunas we have seen is Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. Classic classification we heard over and over again.\n\nSattva is the nature of purity, light, knowledge, illumination, Rajas activity, passion, attachment and Tamas, ignorance, inertia. And then we have seen each one how it binds this consciousness which is pure and pristine in its nature. Once comes in association with the Prakriti, it binds itself to the Prakriti and creates a new conditioned being. So the verse 9, 10 and 11 gives us this relationship. Sattva binds you to happiness, this embodied one, this consciousness which it feels like embodied in myself is bound by the nature of this field. We have seen this field Idam sariram Kshetram ITI abhidhya.\n\nThis body is the field. This field with having its three qualities bind the consciousness in me. But quality of Sattva to happiness. Something happens, I figure it out, I come to know, I enjoy that experience binds Rajastha. The activity, the passion, attachment creates desires, creates activity. And more I do it, more I achieve it, more I get bound, more and more I do stuff I think As I give an example.\n\nWhen I left India I had one very clear goal. If I make hundred thousand rupees, I'll be back to India and start practicing architecture there. In Ahmedabad I made hundred thousand rupees long, long, long long time ago. I'm still outside India. Rajas binds you to activity, more we do more I want to do it so. And then Tamas ignorance, inertia, all three are absolutely necessary for this Prakriti to exist.\n\nJust as whatever the ingredients of the hologram which binds hologram into a form which I perceive has to have it so the next three _Verses_ say Satvam sukhe Sanjayati Rajah Karmani Bharata Gnanam avrutyatu tamah pramade sanjayatu dah summary of what we already seen. Satum sukeshanjayati to the happiness and the pleasure Rajah to karmani Rajastu actions and this knowledge about the self, the very fact I call myself, but I'm not aware of it, I can't define it. As you have seen this example. Everything I use to define myself turns out to something which is related to myself, but not me. My name, my relationship, my profession, my achievements, my losses, whatever that is, but it's not me. What is it that does not let me figure out who I am?\n\nTamas Vinanam Avritya to Tamah Pramadi Sanjay by pramad heedlessness myself tells me who I am. But this Prama, the heedlessness, no, it cannot be. Swamiji used to say, I come here every year. Because when Swamiji was alive, I used to come every year to United States and to Yagna. Some of us were standard devotees. We were always there.\n\nHe said, I'm glad that you guys are not listening to me. I come here, give you my knowledge and in the last day gather it and go back, you know? So that way you keep me in business. Because otherwise, once you understood, you have no need for me. This Tamas, even though we hear, even though we understand, even though conscience tells us this should be right. But I don't think so, because not everybody else is doing it.\n\nSo we get deluded by that Thomas Pramade Sanjay. So here is how he says that pure consciousness is bound into the Prakriti. So now further analysis of how these three gunas work. These three gunas are inherent in all the Prakriti. Tamas is not a negative quality of Prakriti. It is the very essential nature of Prakriti.\n\nFor an atom to remain in solid state, for me to recognize the atom, atom has to have certain inertia in it for me to see it as an atom. If I can start seeing it as electron and proton and neutron, the world will disappear because there is no solid matter around. So the inertia, the Tamas is the essential quality of Prakriti. So is the rajas and so is the Sattva. Because we have tendency to classify with the higher, lower and middle. So we say, well, this is higher, this is lower.\n\nFor Prakriti there is nothing like that. But what is really right is the right balance. How does one particular quality of this Maya binds me? Rajas Tamah Babi Bhuyam Satvam Bhavati Bharata. One may be predominant at any given time and the other two will be subsidiary in how we recognize thing or being. What it is, what is the predominant quality?\n\nWell, yesterday Sanchan Saj does well. Normally he's a very nice guy. But I don't know what happened to him yesterday. In other words, normally he has this predominance of being nice once in a while. Not being nice predominate that any gunas obviously can have predominance over the other. When Sattva predominates Rajas in Tamas, then the experience of Sattva Happens right now I want to understand something, I focus on it, I close all my activity down.\n\nThen the knowledge takes place and say the Sattva is predominating. Everything is now clear to me. Raja satvam tamasteva tamah sattvam rajasthadha. Each one, when it predominates the other, then that quality becomes more apparent. We may have any dish, and if there is more salt, we'll say it's a salty dish. There may be a little sugar in it, all other things.\n\nBut what is predominating we call that it's a salty, it's sweet. Even the sweet has lot of other ingredients and other taste in it. At times Sattva predominates, at times rajas and at times tamas. In all beings, at least at the human beings. Our mind associating with the prakriti, whatever the qualities attach most, that's what I'll say. All of us go to downtown Richmond and we come back and we describe.\n\nAll of us will have different description. Somebody like me will say, you know, the buildings are like this. Each one will come back with a different impression. Because it is my mind associating with it, my mind experiencing this world of objects. Whatever the qualities I pick up is what my mind predominates. There are times when I'll be dominated with Sattva.\n\nThere are times rajas, there are times tamas. But other two at that time are existing but in a subsidiary role. And the next _Verses_ gives you an experience of what happens and when should I see that I am under the influence of Sattva. Sarva dwareshu dehe asmin prakash upajayate. If there's a light coming out of all the gates of my body, the navadvare puree dehi the body, nine gates from all the gates. And this, basically we're talking about this sense perception or gnanendriyah, senses of perception, Pancha ganandriya.\n\nOut of all these five gnanindriya, when there is a light of knowledge emitting, then I should know that gnanam yada tada vidya vibruddham satvam ITI uta. I'm seeing clearly what it is I'm hearing clearly, I'm tasting right things, all that when I'm having experience of knowledge, experience of light, then it is indeed the experience of Sattva. Then it may be known that Sattva is predominant. There are times we are very clear about everything. There is no confusion in our mind. There is no strong passion or desire to do but to know this is fairly logical and we all have experienced that.\n\nSomebody says, neil, I waved at you so many times when I was passing by. You haven't looked at me but didn't acknowledge that I am there. Oh, I didn't see you. But this eye was not having any experience of knowledge. In other words, that the mind wasn't there and there was nowhere to acknowledge what I'm seeing. We all spouses know Meena will get mad, you know, and say I don't like the insult.\n\nHe said, I'd been telling you for last about two minutes and you're not paying attention. No, no, I was paying attention but I was doing something. You know, it happens to me almost three or four times a week. So because my mind is somewhere else, she's continually telling me what happened. And then after about two minutes he realizes that I don't think he listens to anything that I say. No knowledge is taking place.\n\nSo that's not Sattva. That's obviously is my passion for something is taking my mind away. And it is so important for my mind to be there in everything. Once in a while I miss the _Verses_ which I chant. Because within that fraction of a second my mind goes someplace else while I'm chanting desperately seeking which verse I was chanting. Each verse ends with Guru Venama was on a second verse.\n\nI was Guru Vai Namah, third verse on Guru Veh Namah. So because a fraction of a second your mind lost it. The connection with if that happens, it's not the Sattva which is chanting. It is Rajas pre dominated because something about something took over Lo Baha Pravruti Aram Bha. Now this is a pretty Indian concept because it's very difficult for any Westerner to understand Pravrutti Aramba. If something I want to start, it's not Sattva Karmanam Asamahas Proha Rajasya Jayante Vivhrudhai Bharatah Sabha.\n\nIf this is happening in the beginning, Bhagavan said, I'm gonna give you this knowledge which is so profound, having known that you will get rid of all your bondage and liberate yourself. Here is what he's telling us. He's saying how to diagnose yourself, what your situation is otherwise. My mind constantly tells me Neelu is a very nice guy. He always says I'm a very Satvik person. But he said, you have to do self diagnosis you have to do it this way.\n\nFirst one I say there is knowledge coming out of all the gates. It didn't say only one gate or the other all the gate.",

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Ganatra Vibhag Yoga, Yoga of Trigunas. We have concluded that these are the qualities of Prakriti. These Trigunas make the Prakriti what it is. These three gurus come from Maya. Ishwara, in control of Maya, creates Prakrita Maya. That which is not then appears to be there.\n\nThis world of plurality appears to be there. In reality, there is only singularity exist. This Maya creates this Prakriti by three gunas, the Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. So everything in this Prakriti has these three gunas. If you take basic building block of our universe as atom, atom obviously has inertia. It has activity and it has some awareness.\n\nFrom my perspective, atom remains in its space and time because of inertia. If atom doesn't remain in space and time, there's nothing you can do about it. We also know even though it looks inactive, it has extreme activity inside the electron swirling around the neutron or proton within nucleus. So there is rajas, there is Tamas, which is inertia. It keeps it and its shape and its existence in the space and time. It also knows what to do when another atom comes in contact with it, which creates this Prakriti.\n\nSo right from the basic building block to ourselves, these three gunas are existent. We obviously are not really concerned about the Prakruti as the universe right now. We are concerned about the Gunas which are manifesting in my internal instrument. Because the goal of my spiritual quest, as we all learned over and over and over again, is cleansing my internal instrument, which is the mind and intellect. This mind and intellect, when is in action, obviously will manifest. One guna or other is more predominant.\n\nMy mind and intellect is nothing but the impressions of my experiences and the transactions in this world. This experience, living its impression, will either make my thoughts more Satwik, more Rajasic, or more Tamasic. Under this sway of these experiences with the world outside, my internal instruments constantly is transforming from one predominance to another. And that's where we have seen why we should be aware of these gunas. Once I understand how my mind comes under the sway of these gunas I may be able to train my mind in a manner that which will be more beneficial in my spiritual evolution, in my journey from this limited being to the unlimited being. And therefore we are also concerned that this life is not long enough.\n\nI'm trying to attain something but my body doesn't give cooperation and it falls apart prematurely when I have not achieved my goal. The verses which you had been seeing said this is a continuity. This life is nothing but a one chain and the continuity of chains which is your existence. And as this limited being, my existence is more at the subtle instrument level than at this external instrument level. This external instrument will die and perish when it has run its course. Internal instrument will continue.\n\nIt has gathered experience from the past lives, gathering experience in this life and will continue into the next. So the question is what happens when I leave this body? So last three verses deal with that. And as Swamiji says, Hinduism is the only faith where they very systematically deals with afterlife. Whereas most other faiths and most other thoughts in this world do accept that there is a life after this life. So the verses which you have seen so what happens?\n\nWhat will be my destination when I leave this station of life? The first story says if what happens if my mind is in a sattvic mood? Yadas sache pravruddh detu pralayam yati deha brittama vidam lokan amalan pratipadya de if my mind is in a sattvic mood of predominance at the time of my living I will reach the world of the norths of the highest. So we'll go in the environment which will aid into my journey from this limited being as the Jiva to their higher being. So what happens at the time of my death? I may be comatose, I may be in pain, so my mind cannot think about anything.\n\nBut remember what happens when you go to deep sleep. Last night when you went to sleep? Not necessarily every night you go to sleep you are in the same type of a mood or maybe aware of when you went to sleep. But the next morning when you wake up, you're basically the same person who went to sleep a night before. As Swamiji explains, an architect going to sleep is not going to wake up as a surgeon next morning just because the night before he was thinking about or watching er, he's going to wake up as an architect because all his life accumulated the experiences of an architect. And my mind is predominantly has become an architectural mind.\n\nSo when I wake up next morning, no matter what show I saw on the TV that last night, my mind must be completely thinking something else. I'll start with where I left off. So it may be that at the time of death I may not be aware. But the subtle tendencies which my mind has gathered will take me to that world. Experiences we don't remember. Even something about what I did in my childhood.\n\nI don't remember what happened in my youth. Few things here and there we remember. But the tendencies we gathered made me who I am today. My across the street neighbor used to take me to Gita class. I really had no interest whatsoever. But because I couldn't say lopamasi no, I went with her.\n\nThat Gita class led me to Gita class today. So the tendencies which we gather we may not remember anything about. The experience of the tendencies we gather creates the sattvic mood or rajasik mood or tamasic mode and we carry on. So it says one who dies with a sattvic predominance of mind will go to the world of highers. Purana says the Brahmaloka where abundance of happiness, very little sorrow or no sorrow and abundance of creativity. The world of creativity.\n\nSomebody who revels in creativity and get the joy out of that creativity. The next verse said Rajasi satvam gatva Karma sangi sujayate. If all my life experience was rajasik in business and whatever that is, obviously when I die my mind is still in that mode. I'm not carrying any experiences. I'm not carrying any memory of the experiences but carrying the tendency of that experiences with me. Maybe the last 15 days of my life I'm completely comatose.\n\nBut that just the connection with the body is disconnected. Mind in its own remain in its own health. And when it leaves, it carries those tendencies with it. So what I'm going to do, I'm going to look for an environment where I can exhaust my vasanas tendencies for being active. So I may be born in a businessman's house. Karma sanghi su Jayate.\n\nHe gets an environment, the world of action where he can exhaust his vasanas for actions. Lord is very compassionate. The Lord of this universe and my own Lord is very compassionate. He only gives me what I want. If I want a knowledge and creativity and awareness about myself then he will give me that I want actions. He will give me that he will give me an opportunity to exhaust my vasanasi mudhoni sujay.\n\nBut for some reason all my experience of life is all tamas. Then I'll go to the moodyoni. And Swamiji basically explained that Mudhioni is one which is not aware of anything which is animal kingdom and plant kingdom. Now obviously we are animals as well but we are somewhat evolved where we are aware of things. But I am not really comfortable in this world. So sometimes we may be put in this position but may not be comfortable in their environment.\n\nWhat is the right thing to do? Change that environment. Go back to where I feel comfortable so I can start my progress appropriately. I don't know here, but in India they sometimes will put you back in the fifth grade and say well he's not going to put him back in the fourth grade again because that will be the most comfortable. See it's not a punishment. Lord never punishes you for your own own action.\n\nYou only punish yourself for your own action. Once I have decided the moodyoni is something I'm the most comfortable with, Bhagavan said go back, start all over again from there and go further from there. And the next verse says Karmanaha sukrata shyahuhu satvikam nirmalam falam. So what am I supposed? Am I just simply programmed and by chance the experiences I'm experiencing in this world that gonna make me either as Tamasik Rajasik or Satwik? You do have a choice.\n\nVery little but you have a choice. And the choice is Karmanaha sukrutashya ahuhu satvikam nirmalam falam. The results of the good action is pure and Satwik rajahtu falam dukkham. The result of Rajas is dukkham. And I'll tell you, we have difficulty accepting that. If that's the case, we'll all stop acting.\n\nBut remember, we are not in a business class. We are not into any kind of a social reform class. We are in a class to reform our own mind. In our mind you can try yourself and put in a spreadsheet about what you had done and what the final outcome was of that action. In the end there will be more pain than what you gained out of that action. Oh boy, that was a project from hell.\n\nBut we were dying to get that project. Because in the end this interaction with this world create frictions and the frictions create pain. The result is Always more pain and little happiness. And therefore Vedanta also called this world Dukkhalay the house of pain. Now this is not something to discourage people from doing what they are doing. This is for you to know for your mind what is good.\n\nFor my mind to remain in equanimity. If I attach myself to this world then nothing but pain. If I attach to good actions, selfless actions, Karma Yoga the results are sattvic and pure. Tamas Agnanam Tamasah falam Very obvious. If I am completely in tamas what is the result? So you decide what you should do.\n\nOnly thing you have in your hand is your own actions. Nahi ka chit Kshanama bhi Jatuti Sthadi Akarma krut. You cannot stand for any minute without acting. You will have good results that will lead to Satwik environment. So Bharu wants to do that. Sattvaat Sanjaya Teghnanam so what happens when I do good actions?\n\nWell people praise me and say Neel is a good person. No he said that's not your goal. That's actually a detriment to you. More people praise you, more ego gets hardened. You get more criticism. Durijan Niire Rakhi Angan Kuti Chabai Binapani bin Sabana Nirmal kare Sadh Sattvat Sanjayate Gnaram but why?\n\nI'm doing good actions because I want sattvic thoughts and sattvic mood. And what's the result of that? I'll have the knowledge. Knowledge about my own self and what is my goal and how do I get there? Sattvat Sanjayateghnanam Rajaso Lobha Evacha he said do you mean to say this man of action which everybody talking about is not good. But this dynamic man of action if he's driven by his own gains the result will be greed.\n\nLobe we had this hedge fund manager Rajarajaratnam I was a billionaire. He must have come with $8 in his pocket from India. He was a multi billionaire. But where is he today? Why do you need all those billions and then still have to do something which is illegal?",
      "reflection": "Notice the play of the three gunas in yourself today. When do you feel clear and light (sattva)? When restless and driven (rajas)? When heavy and stuck (tamas)?\n\nDon't judge—just observe. This observation itself is the beginning of freedom from the gunas' grip. The one who watches the gunas is not bound by them.\n\nConsider what activities, foods, relationships, and environments increase sattva in your life. What increases rajas? Tamas? With this awareness, you can make wiser choices."

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 14, Gunatreya Vibhag Yoga, Yoga of Trigunas. So so far, first we learned about I, the conditioned consciousness in the first six chapters. Next six chapters we learned about the Supreme Consciousness. From conditioned consciousness to the supreme Consciousness is the journey which we all are taking. So to help that journey, in the last chapter we have defined what is the field and who is the knower and what is the differentiation between the two. So we have said that the I, the knower, know the field which is this body, mind and intellect.\n\nI know my body, I know my mind, I know my intellect, therefore they are my field. And I, the knower is the knower of the field. And the field cannot be knower and knower cannot be filled. Now, in this chapter we are learning about the qualities of the field. So we are taking it a step at a time to understand how can I take this journey from this conditioned consciousness which I consider I, or in Vedanta called Jiva, the limited self, which I consider myself to be the ego from the supreme self which is my true nature. And therefore the quest in life is always to achieve that balance where there is no sorrows, no limitations, nothing that will create unhappiness, a perfect happiness.\n\nAnd because there is no unhappiness, it cannot be called happiness, but just a bliss. So we have seen this and then we say these gunas. The Prakriti has three gunas. The field which is part of the Prakriti has three gunas. These gunas bind the knower to the field. Those are the attractions which creates bondage between the Purusha and Prakriti, the knower in the field and create identification.\n\nThis identification is because of these gunas. And those three gunas we have seen as Sattva rajas and Tamas. My awareness about this field, Sattva rajas, the activity, the passion for something I like and then ignorance. These three binds me. So how do I get out of these three? Or is one helping Me to get out of this conditioned consciousness to supreme consciousness.\n\nSo we have seen that quality the Sattva gives knowledge, Rajas gives activity. In the byproduct would be greed. One activity leads to another and to another and another and there's no end to it. So that creates greed and Tamas creates inertia. So now we have to transcend from one to another. So one, the lowest we can see is inertia from our perspective.\n\nThese are the qualities of my mind right now. These are the qualities of the field. In this field the body is obviously completely inert. By its very nature it just cannot do anything but to exist. Just like we have seen, the atom has inertia and therefore it exists. As long as the inertia is there, atom exists as an atom.\n\nOnce you disturb the inertia, the Rajas will explode into atomic energy. Body is nothing but inertia. But the mind and intellect have all three. The Rajas, Tamas and Sattva. So these are the qualities of my mind which I'm most interested in. And that depending on the quality of my mind, if it is Sattva, it has a knowledge.\n\nPrakash Gnaan if it is Rajas, I'm active new project, new activity and inertia. Don't want to know anything, don't want to do anything. So the verses which you have seen last time now tells me that what happens if one is predominant or other in my mental zone? Urdhvam Gachandi Sattvasthaha. Those who are established in Sattva. If my mental quality is predominantly Sattva, Urdhum Gachandi I go higher, higher and lower is obviously concept of my mind.\n\nI'm going towards my goal. Going from the conditioned consciousness to supreme consciousness, unconditioned consciousness. This conditioning which is binding me, my goal is to get rid of it and become one with the unconditioned supreme consciousness. That which leads me to my goal I consider higher. So Urdham Gachandi, Satvastaha, Sattvik, mode of my mind will lead me towards my goal of unconditioning this conditioning. There is Urdham Gacchanti, Satvasthaha, Madhe, Tishthanti, Rajasaha whose mental zone is predominantly Raju Sikh.\n\nThey remained in the middle. Neither they are going up nor they are going down. They remain in a status quo. Just like our election. We were where we started. Rajasik do a lot of activities.\n\nBut in the end if you see the sum total of the result is the same. If you can look at all the activities we have done in life. All we have done is to create security for ourselves, stability for ourselves, some kind of a protection that we remain in a good condition. And in the end it all comes down to the same thing. Every few years we have to go through the same thing over and over and over again. So they basically remain in the same state they are in.\n\nNeither they are making progress upward nor they are going downwards. Neither they are going towards unbundening themselves from their bondages nor they are creating more bondage they are in the same state. Jagannya gunavuthistaha adoga chanti tamasaha. But those who are abiding into the lower qualities of tamas, they go down. Obviously we are talking about human beings. Obviously we are talking about the human mind.\n\nHuman mind which is evolved into this for the activity, the knowledge to understand the world around it. More it understands, goes higher, more it gets entangled into this world. It remains where it is. More it doesn't want to know. It goes down, down in a sense, in a situation where there is no more knowledge necessary to survive, just basic knowledge of I exist and I survive is good enough. They go down in that state of existence.\n\nIn the next verse we have seen said na anyam gune bhyakarata raha yada drasthano nupashadi. Why did we look at that last verse? To introspect in spiritual quest. Introspection is the most important aspect of our pragma. You have to constantly introspect and see what is there in my mental zone. And if I find any impurities I need to remove it that they go antahakarana shuddhe.\n\nAnd then once I remove the impurity, the purity itself will reveal what is right and wrong. If I introspect and find myself to be in the tamasic zone, my next goal is to become Rajasic Tamasic to Satwik is not a a easy journey. So you have to go through Rajasek. So if you completely. That's why Bhagavad Gita says the people who are doing good for the wrong reason, let them do it, do not stop them. If I'm giving donation to make my name, I'm at least better than the one who is not giving at all.\n\nThat's why Bhagavad Gita let them do for whatever the motivation. But you need to make progress into your. So he said, if I am in a tamasic zone, well, let me make sure that at least I'm active. If I'm an active zone, I said Samila, I need to slow down and understand why I'm doing it. That introspection lead me to what will be the remedy. It would be my next efforts.\n\nAnd therefore the next verse says but this is not enough. So generally we understand well if I'm tamasik or rajasik, once I'm a rajasik to Sattvik, I'm done. Because now I'm remaining in the Sattvik guna. But we have also seen that even this Sattvik guna is also a bondage. We get also get used to of doing good because people praise me well you are really doing very well. So I want to keep getting that praise over and over and over again.\n\nIn other words, you get attached to happiness. The joy which comes out of knowledge, the joy which comes out of doing good binds me to this. It does not let me leave. I like we have a saying in our architecture that what happens to the old architects? They don't die, they just wither away. They continue working till they drop dead in the studio.\n\nBecause that attachment to creativity, that something I'm doing it, I'm creating that attachment doesn't let you retire. So the bondage to Sattva is still a bondage. So what is the real goal for that conditioned self is to go beyond gunas. And how do you go beyond gunas? Na anyam gunai bhya kartaram There is no other doer in my life other than my own gunas. Only gunas are the doers for everything which I am doing and accomplishing and losing.\n\nYada drastan unupashadi one who starts seeing it then. All my actions are driven by the modes of my mind. Only when my mind wants to see sky fall at that time. Meena read this chapter is so nice in my I'm going to see Bond movie. Right now you can do whatever you want. I'm not in a mood right now.\n\nSo who drives me to Bond movement? Who brings me to here to Gita class? So if I can make my mind the doer and say all that is I do is driven by the quality of my mind as the thought. So the action, whatever my thought, my action will be driven by that. So all my actions I should assign them clearly to my mind. All the gunas are doing what I have all done now Anyam there is no other you can say well I was forced by the society.\n\nWell I really didn't want to go to see a movie. But really they insisted. We used to do that when I was in college. Well, I really didn't want to go there just before the exam. But all my room partners they said Neil, I blame on my room partners why I went to see a movie just before the day of the examination. But if I had no tendencies I wouldn't go.\n\nSo Bhagavan says Na anyam guna Bhyakaratam There is none other than my Gunas are the doers for all my actions. One who sees that Yada drastha Anupashyati One who starts seeing it. All my actions are driven by my mind and the qualities of my mind. Gune Bihacha Param vette and he says there is someone higher than these gunas. There is someone who is much higher than my mind who also sees the limitations of my mind. Well, I shouldn't have gone to see a movie just before the exam.\n\nThe one who says I shouldn't have that I is different than the I who went to see a movie. Gune Bhyah param veti One who knows that there is one who is above these gunas Mad Bhavam sa adigachadi and identify with that. I really don't need to take any credit or blame for my actions. My mind was in that mood and I did that. However, I am not my mind. My mind is just a field in which my consciousness functions.\n\nThat consciousness never took part in any of the action. If my identification takes place that way. Bhagavan says Mad Bhavam sa adhi gachadi he attains my being. We have seen the supreme consciousness. Unconditioned by the limitations of body, mind and intellectual he becomes one with me. As Swamiji says, he doesn't become Krishna with flute and peacock feather.\n\nHe becomes one with that unconditioned consciousness. He now starts identifying this room space. Once leaves the identification with the walls, floor and ceiling remaining within the room it identifies now with the space outside. I'm none other than this universal space. Gunaan Etan Atityaha Trindehi Deha Samud Bhavan this dehi One who considers this is me. This body, this mind is me is created by this guna.\n\nThis guna bound me to this body and said this is me.",

In the byproduct would be greed. One activity leads to another and to another and another and there's no end to it. So that creates greed and Tamas creates inertia.

Urdhvam Gachandi Sattvasthaha. Those who are established in Sattva.

Going from the conditioned consciousness to supreme consciousness, unconditioned consciousness. This conditioning which is binding me, my goal is to get rid of it and become one with the unconditioned supreme consciousness. That which leads me to my goal I consider higher. So Urdham Gachandi, Satvastaha, Sattvik, mode of my mind will lead me towards my goal of unconditioning this conditioning. There is Urdham Gacchanti, Satvasthaha, Madhe, Tishthanti, Rajasaha whose mental zone is predominantly Raju Sikh.\n\nThey remained in the middle. Neither they are going up nor they are going down.

Neither they are going towards unbundening themselves from their bondages nor they are creating more bondage they are in the same state. Jagannya gunavuthistaha adoga chanti tamasaha. But those who are abiding into the lower qualities of tamas, they go down. Obviously we are talking about human beings. Obviously we are talking about the human mind.\n\nHuman mind which is evolved into this for the activity, the knowledge to understand the world around it. More it understands, goes higher, more it gets entangled into this world. It remains where it is. More it doesn't want to know. It goes down, down in a sense, in a situation where there is no more knowledge necessary to survive, just basic knowledge of I exist and I survive is good enough. They go down in that state of existence.\n\nIn the next verse we have seen said na anyam gune bhyakarata raha yada drasthano nupashadi. Why did we look at that last verse? To introspect in spiritual quest. Introspection is the most important aspect of our pragma. You have to constantly introspect and see what is there in my mental zone. And if I find any impurities I need to remove it that they go antahakarana shuddhe.\n\nAnd then once I remove the impurity, the purity itself will reveal what is right and wrong.

But you need to make progress into your. So he said, if I am in a tamasic zone, well, let me make sure that at least I'm active. If I'm an active zone, I said Samila, I need to slow down and understand why I'm doing it. That introspection lead me to what will be the remedy. It would be my next efforts.\n\nAnd therefore the next verse says but this is not enough. So generally we understand well if I'm tamasik or rajasik, once I'm a rajasik to Sattvik, I'm done. Because now I'm remaining in the Sattvik guna. But we have also seen that even this Sattvik guna is also a bondage. We get also get used to of doing good because people praise me well you are really doing very well. So I want to keep getting that praise over and over and over again.\n\nIn other words, you get attached to happiness. The joy which comes out of knowledge, the joy which comes out of doing good binds me to this. It does not let me leave. I like we have a saying in our architecture that what happens to the old architects? They don't die, they just wither away. They continue working till they drop dead in the studio.\n\nBecause that attachment to creativity, that something I'm doing it, I'm creating that attachment doesn't let you retire. So the bondage to Sattva is still a bondage. So what is the real goal for that conditioned self is to go beyond gunas. And how do you go beyond gunas? Na anyam gunai bhya kartaram There is no other doer in my life other than my own gunas. Only gunas are the doers for everything which I am doing and accomplishing and losing.\n\nYada drastan unupashadi one who starts seeing it then. All my actions are driven by the modes of my mind. Only when my mind wants to see sky fall at that time. Meena read this chapter is so nice in my I'm going to see Bond movie. Right now you can do whatever you want. I'm not in a mood right now.\n\nSo who drives me to Bond movement? Who brings me to here to Gita class? So if I can make my mind the doer and say all that is I do is driven by the quality of my mind as the thought. So the action, whatever my thought, my action will be driven by that. So all my actions I should assign them clearly to my mind. All the gunas are doing what I have all done now Anyam there is no other you can say well I was forced by the society.\n\nWell I really didn't want to go to see a movie. But really they insisted. We used to do that when I was in college. Well, I really didn't want to go there just before the exam. But all my room partners they said Neil, I blame on my room partners why I went to see a movie just before the day of the examination. But if I had no tendencies I wouldn't go.\n\nSo Bhagavan says Na anyam guna Bhyakaratam There is none other than my Gunas are the doers for all my actions. One who sees that Yada drastha Anupashyati One who starts seeing it. All my actions are driven by my mind and the qualities of my mind. Gune Bihacha Param vette and he says there is someone higher than these gunas. There is someone who is much higher than my mind who also sees the limitations of my mind. Well, I shouldn't have gone to see a movie just before the exam.\n\nThe one who says I shouldn't have that I is different than the I who went to see a movie. Gune Bhyah param veti One who knows that there is one who is above these gunas Mad Bhavam sa adigachadi and identify with that. I really don't need to take any credit or blame for my actions. My mind was in that mood and I did that. However, I am not my mind. My mind is just a field in which my consciousness functions.\n\nThat consciousness never took part in any of the action. If my identification takes place that way. Bhagavan says Mad Bhavam sa adhi gachadi he attains my being. We have seen the supreme consciousness. Unconditioned by the limitations of body, mind and intellectual he becomes one with me. As Swamiji says, he doesn't become Krishna with flute and peacock feather.\n\nHe becomes one with that unconditioned consciousness. He now starts identifying this room space. Once leaves the identification with the walls, floor and ceiling remaining within the room it identifies now with the space outside. I'm none other than this universal space. Gunaan Etan Atityaha Trindehi Deha Samud Bhavan this dehi One who considers this is me. This body, this mind is me is created by this guna.\n\nThis guna bound me to this body and said this is me.",
      "reflection": "Notice the play of the three gunas in yourself today. When do you feel clear and light (sattva)? When restless and driven (rajas)? When heavy and stuck (tamas)?\n\nDon't judge—just observe. This observation itself is the beginning of freedom from the gunas' grip. The one who watches the gunas is not bound by them.\n\nConsider what activities, foods, relationships, and environments increase sattva in your life. What increases rajas? Tamas? With this awareness, you can make wiser choices."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 14, Gunatreya Vibagi yoga, yoga of three gunas. So so far in Bhagavad Gita you learnt about ourselves, who we are as the limited beings, how we function, how can we make the most out of our actions? How can we Most efficient In the first six chapters. And we learned that working without any attachment or expectation is actually the best method to gain the most out of your life and most out of your actions. To become the most proficient and efficient, the basic requirement is not to get too attached to whatever you are doing. This is contrary completely to what we think.\n\nWe think the more passionate I am, the better I will be. Bhagavad Gita says it's other way around. Less you are attached to what you are doing, more efficient you would be, the more successful you would be. So this is what we learned in the first six chapters. That's called a Karma Yoga. How to act in this world as a limited being and to get the most out of your life is Karma Yoga.\n\nThen focus on who you are in reality. That you are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not this intellect. So Yudyana Yoga, what we are contemplating upon that supreme self, the self that I am other than this limited self we have learnt in the next sets of chapters culminated into Bhakti Yoga, the devotion to that self. Unless I identify with something higher, I cannot detach from the lower. To resign from my job, I have to find another job before I resign. If I'm a smart person, don't resign before you get a next job.\n\nYou have to find a better job before you can resign from your current job, which you either hate or at least not love as much right now. This limited self, even though I'm comfortable, it's not the best situation I'm in. I'm not always happy, I'm not always achieving what I'm trying to achieve. So I'm trying to see something better than what I have today, something which can Give me permanent happiness. Bhagawan said, you identify with that self which is capable of giving you the permanent happiness. So that's Bhakti Yoga.\n\nBhakti Yoga is truly to identify with one which has no limitations. As long as I'm identified with this limited being, there is no chance ever in eons to come that I'll achieve my goal of being perfectly happy. But once you identify with that supreme self. So then we are trying to discuss in the last set of these chapters, what is the difference between the limited self and the higher self? And how to go beyond those limitations. So the last chapter we talked about the Kshatrakshatragna Vibhaga Yoga.\n\nWhat is the field and who is the knower? The knower is always someone other than the field. If I know something, that means that's an object. See, if I know my limited self, the limited self is an object. And I, the knower, is knowing the limited self. So there we identified that this body, this Idam, Sareeram, Kaunteya, Eddhikshatra, Mabhidiyya, this body is the field.\n\nThis body includes all my experiences, my mind, my thoughts, modifications of my moods, all that is filled. But one who is witnessing it is the witness. So now how do I go beyond this? We have been learning in this chapter what is binding this unlimited self to their limited self. And we came to the conclusion that the three gunas of the Prakriti. This Prakriti, the manifest world, has three basic qualities.\n\nThe three ingredients which makes it pluralistic world. Now projecting as a plural world. We know from science there is nothing but singularity before the Big Bang. And then this world of cosmos came into existence. I was just reading Stephen Hawking, some dialogue with somebody. And somebody asked him, so what was before Big Bang?\n\nAnd he said, nothing. Nothing before Big Bang. So there was something which obviously we say nothing can. Something cannot come out of nothing. So there was something, but something was not as divided as we perceive it right now. We also learned in cause and effect.\n\nThat effect can be nothing but the cause modified. This cosmos cannot be anything but the singularity modified. So Bhagavan said that you have to understand what is binding you to this worldview of pluralistic world. And you are at the center of your own world. I'm in the center of my world. Everything relates to me.\n\nIf I remove myself from this world, the world disappears. When I'm not there, that world does not exist. What's Happening in Syria right now does not exist for me because I'm not there. But what's happening here, I'm very much involved. It all relates to me. Once I remove this limited self out of this equation, the pluralistic world does not exist.\n\nThese three gunas are binding this infinite to this limited self. Gunas as we have learned, also means ropes. These three ropes are binding you to this limitedness. We are not giving up our limitedness, but expecting infinite happiness, unlimited existence. We all think that we are going to exist forever. We have learned in Mahabharata that Yaksha asked you this direct question.\n\nWhat is the most wonderful you find about human beings? The most wonderful, most amazing thing is that everyone knows he's going to die. But they all live like they're never going to die. We cannot think about ourselves as non existing. Existence is my real nature. But I also know that this life as I know will end sooner or later.\n\nHow can I get out of this fear of mortality, this fear of unhappiness? Bhagawan said you need to get rid of these three binding ropes. You have this great wealth of Satchit and Ananda, but you just don't have the password to that account. Somebody says, Neel, your great grandfather left great wealth in Swiss account. The only problem is we don't have the account number. So we know that we are Satchitananda.\n\nWe just don't know the key to it. So Bhagawan said that know that these three are binding you. Once you get out of this three, you will achieve that state where you are immortal, always blissful in and all knowing. So we have learned that these three gunas are binding. They are Sattva, rajas and Tamas. Sattva binds you with happiness, Rajas by activity and Thomas by laziness or inactivity.\n\nSo the ultimate prescription was Guna tita Bhava go beyond these three gunas. So Arjuna obviously says, okay, all this well and good, but how can one get to that point? Last verse we have seen says Kailinge hi Trigunan etan atito Bhavati prabhu. How can anyone can go beyond these three gunas? Once he achieves that, what will be his behavior? Katram chetam tri guna nivartate.\n\nHow can I understand that this is possible? Give me some indications of what will be like a litmus test, that if I see this that means that person has gone beyond trigona. And also if that is possible, that somebody has Already done that. Then tell me the recipe how to get there. Now we know that Bhagavan has been talking about it all throughout in Bhagavad Gita how to become that. But Arjuna one more time asked this question to make it very clear that this is what the goal of life is.\n\nSo Bhagavan answer in the following _Verses_ and it's really very unique. Verse verse 22 and this is something we really want to contemplate. What is his answer to it? Prakashamcha Pravritimcha Mohammad Pandava Nadvasti Sampravruttani he did not say that these gunas will disappear once you become Nirguna Gunatita. He does not hate when these three gunas are present. Prakasham Cha Pravritimcha Moham these are the effects of these three gunas.\n\nPrakash Light knowledge, clear headedness. We clearly understand what's going on. Things are very clear, no confusion. That's the effect of Sattva. When my mind and intellect are in Sattva Guna, everything is crystal clear. I don't need somebody's advice.\n\nI know what is right and what is wrong. Pravrutyam activity I'm busy. That's the effect of Rajas and Moham Delusion. I don't understand what's going on. I don't know whether they're right or wrong. Is Moham is the effect of Tamas.\n\nWhen these are present in my personality, in my mind, I don't hate them. So up till now we were thinking that when somebody says Guna Titaha Bhava means I will not have those gunas at all. Bhagavad makes it very clear these gunas will remain as they are. Just because you became Sthita Prajna, the world is not going to change. Neither the quality and the nature of your body, mind and intellect are going to change. As we are talking about.\n\nIf I am a weakling, it's not overnight going to change because I have become a Gnani that I will be the most powerful person. Body will have his own Dharma. It will be exactly what it is before realization and after realization. Mind will have its own Dharma. It has been with you for eons. It has own personality.\n\nIt's not going to change. Neither intellect overnight is going to become Einstein. We know these are my equipment and I have to live with their limitations. But I, at the core of my being, seeing that happening in my mind and intellect remain a witness And I don't hate that. Why I am in this mood is not a question. This is how I react when things happen this way.\n\nThis is my nature, not Nivratani Kankshati he also does not desire when they are not present. So when I am in a sattvic mood I believe things are very clear. I'm very very happy about my own clarity. Then when I lose that sattvic mood and get into Rajasigant Tama Singh I hate that I want to be back to my serene, clean, clear state of mind. Bhagavan said that's not possible and therefore you shouldn't be desirous of that. See, many people say I was meditating the very first day it was very good but second day onward nothing really happened.\n\nMore you desire more it will stay away from you. In Gujarat there is a saying which says. One who is asking for it, the things go away from them and one who is saying I don't need it people will come to you more you say I don't need it, people will offer you more you say I want it people to take away from you. So Bhagavan said that do not have any of this when they present the effects of these three gunas don't hate them. Understand that these are the common experiences for everyone. Na Nivruttaani when you are not something I was enjoying my activity, I was very busy and now I'm not accepted as is.\n\nSo the acceptance is the mark of a true Gnani One who accepts his reality as is he says such a person is Bhagawan Arjuna's question what are his qualities? His qualities are he accepts things as they are. He does not hate them if they are happening he does not desire if they are not happening. Now this is something for us is very difficult to accept because as soon as we talk about somebody and say I don't know he has been talking about all this. But then the other day this thing happened and then he reacted this way. He reacted this way because this is how he was made up of all his life.\n\nBut you do not know how that incident affected him so but once at the core of your being you become a witness.",
      "reflection": "Notice the play of the three gunas in yourself today. When do you feel clear and light (sattva)? When restless and driven (rajas)? When heavy and stuck (tamas)?\n\nDon't judge—just observe. This observation itself is the beginning of freedom from the gunas' grip. The one who watches the gunas is not bound by them.\n\nConsider what activities, foods, relationships, and environments increase sattva in your life. What increases rajas? Tamas? With this awareness, you can make wiser choices."

      ],
      "commentary": "Okay, so I will be discussing the last four _Verses_ of chapter 14. The chapter 14, which is the Gunatraya Vibhaga Yoga, which we have discussed and basically we have found so far that in this Prakriti, this manifest world, everything has these three gunas, which is the signature of Prakriti, that everything has sattva, rajas and tamas. That is Sattva, the light, the knowledge, the awareness, the rajas, the activity and tamas, inertia. These three gunas that are binding this supreme self which has no limitations to this limited being. These qualities belong to my body, mind and intellect. Once the consciousness attaches to this, it takes upon itself all the limitations of Prakriti.\n\nSo I, the ego is right now conditioned by this body, mind and intellectual. Therefore it has all the limitations of body, mind and intellect. Therefore it goes through the sorrows and happiness, pleasant experience and unpleasant experiences, conducive situation and unconducive situation. Because each entity by itself is its own priorities and its own situations. World remaining the world. One person sees it as very positive, the other sees it very negative.\n\nDepending on their own conditioning, one who goes beyond these three gunas will be beyond all these conflicts and sorrows. So what we have seen in this is that these three gunas also belongs to my mind. It is my mind which is sometimes in a sattvic, rajasik or tamashik. Depending on the qualities of my mind, I'll see this world. Whether it is Sattvik, rajasik or tamas. My experiences will be driven by the moods of my mind.\n\nSo if I can get over this, if I can introspect and can vigilantly monitor the moods of my mind, I will be able to go above the situations which I am facing. Situation remaining the same, I can change the mood of my mind and that will change my reaction to the situation. But you see, the ultimate goal is the one who goes beyond three gunas all the time. So the verse we have seen last Sunday, udasina, avadasina, gunehi, yona vichalyate. One who is indifferent to these gunas and does not gets swallowed by this guna. Guna vartanta ITHI eva avatastati na ingate.\n\nWhat is happening in this world is nothing but play of the gunas. So gunas are the one which are acting in this world. Guna guneshu vartan taha ITI mattwa NASA jate. Knowing that what that is happening is the gunas of my senses and the guna of this world of objects are reacting with each other. When I have an experience, there are experiences between the gunas of my senses and my body and my mind and interact with the gunas of that. So when I come across this conducive situation, I feel happy.\n\nUnconditional situation. I'm not happy knowing that the self that I am do not get disturbed by it. This verse 23 Guna vartanta itiyeva avati sthati na ingate. Knowing that these are all the play of the gunas only and nothing to do with I the self, he does not move from his state of bliss. He's always in the state of bliss as the self. When we, as we listen to example, when we hear what's happening in Tahrir Square in Egypt, does it really make me so upset that I couldn't sleep at night?\n\nI may have my opinion whether they're good or bad for the world or whatever it is, but that's all it is. I'm a third party observer. If I can do the same thing for everything happening to me in this Tahrir Square, then I will be the same way. That's all it's saying. So now Arjuna had asked three questions. One is what are the marks of a person who has gone beyond the gunas?\n\nThis is exactly similar to chapter two where he says, what are the qualities of a person who is Buddhist established into the wisdom? Same thing he says, how do I know that person has gone beyond gunas? Then he says, how does he moves around? He talks in this world. And lastly, how did he do it? The one who is beyond gunas, knowing thus that this is the play of gunas only, he does not get disturbed.\n\nThat's the mark of him. What will be his behavior? We have seen in the following _Verses_, Samadukha swasthaha samalosta nah tulya priya apriya dhiraha tulya nindya atmast sans tuthi. We have seen this in Bhagavad Gita before the quality of a person whose Buddhi is established in the supreme self and not in this limited self. When things occur in this life, I see that it's occurring with this ego reacting with the world outside and therefore Samadhu Khashuka. Therefore whether condition is conducive or non conducive, he remains the same.\n\nHe sees that we don't have a big riots. As I said, when winter comes from spring we move to fall and then winter. We don't have riots in the streets outside. Why do we have this conditioning now? That's how the nature is. After the spring fall has to come and after the fall the winter has to come.\n\nWe adjust to it in our life we are not accepting that we always want hundred percent happiness all the time. Therefore we get all disturbed. But person who knows this, just like I know that the fall will come after spring and winter will come after fall. He knows that after every happy occasion there is something which is unhappy, non conducive. Those of you educated by the Indian TV knows this all the time, right? So Samadhukha Sukha has Svasthaha.\n\nHe remains Svasthaha balanced with that affected by the Sukha or Dukkha. Knowing this is a temporary occurring between the gunas of myself as the body, mind, intellect and the world economy is doing well. We were all very happy. Everybody talks about the party. Nothing but how much money they made in the stock market. Now we all talk about I don't know what Obama is doing.\n\nWhy doesn't he think about me? That's how the nature of this world is Samalosta ashma kanchanaha. He also sees no greater value in one thing of this world than the other. Now does that mean that somebody asks for you know, one rupee, he gives away thousand dollar note. No transaction in this world is a transaction between I the limited being and there. That is where there is called Vyavahara.\n\nThen Vyavahara should be appropriate to that. However, I don't see that as the one Vyavahara is more important than the other. Swamiji gives example that when you were a little kid, something a card from whatever, you know the game card one was very valuable than the other. I grew up in India so we used to have parlays bottle top. So there was a value parlayed. One has a greater value than if you were socio or something else, right?\n\nAnybody remember that? Now in those days can you imagine your wealth about those parlor bottle taps or this socio and this thing somebody takes away from you. But when you grow out of it, all those bottle tops are bottle taps and they worth nothing for me, you see one who sees the world that way. It has its own value in that particular transaction at a particular time. Therefore, we say, well, you may have styrofoam cup and somebody has a gold cup. Both are thirsty and going to a lake, which one is more valuable than the other?\n\nAs long as there is an emptiness which can fetch water. For me, that's all it counts for. At that moment, the value of gold and value of styrofoam is exactly same depending on which can fetch more water. So sama losta asma kanchanaha. He does not give greater value to one or the other, knowing that the value only belongs to the exchange or the utility in that particular transaction. Tulya priya a priya there obviously we all can use.\n\nHe remains same when something comes which is dear to me or not dear to me because it is not in my hand. We struggle through in this economy, go through these interviews and proposals and we come out and everybody says, Neel, you really did a fantastic presentation. I feel so good till I hear that my competition got the project. Things will come to you by its own nature. They are not depending on my situation. They're coming to me by its own nature.\n\nAnd I consider that is my right or my misfortune that is coming to me. You can really use it. I said, boy, Neel, you did so good when you don't. I think you should have prepared a little better. Neel, I think this time you were not really. You should have prepared for the head interview or bad.\n\nWhat happened suddenly, because my success now defines whether I was good or not. We were reading about Steve Jobs. He said he threw away all the rules of business. No focus groups, no surveys, everything. What do people know what they want, I will tell them what they want. So he worked completely contrary to other people's business model, taught in Harvard and everywhere else.\n\nAnd he's the most successful company. So now we are saying, well, let's look at the Steve Jobs model, how he made the company. You have to remain same whether people are praising you or not. Praising you simply because it is the nature of the world, not yours. And then the next verse we have seen says, Mana apamana yoho tulyaha atulyo mitraha aripaksha yoho. Continuing the Same argument.\n\nBhagavan says such a person who has gone beyond guna is acting in this manner. He is working in this world as a normal person. But in his mind, he sees all this is a temporary occurring nothing that he controls. All his duty is to act according to dharma in each situation. Mana apaman yoho this is obviously very, very important to us because we get hurt very easily. Mana and apmana is at our mental level.\n\nThis is truly at our mind's level. Sometimes the person who is telling you had no intention of insulting you or hurting you. But you take it that way because your mental climate was such that you receive it. If I'm supremely confident, people say, this is not doing, don't worry about it. But I'm already shaky in sense. Then somebody says, neil, you're not.\n\nThen I collapse right there. So it is not the world, but my mind decide whether this mana or of mana. He is so established in himself that what comes from the world, he just takes that for its face value and moves on. Mitraha aripakshayo ho. This is another thing. These are my friends and these are my enemies.\n\nMy relationship may be different with each other, but my reaction to them should remain the same. That does not mean that our enemies are attacking your country. And you say, well, same way, we'll receive you as we receive our allies that time your vivahar is to protect your country. But just as Gandhi said, I hate the British government but not the British people or something like that. It's not the person you are hating or person you are reacting to, but the action you are reacting to. Therefore, you have tulya mitra aripaksha.\n\nAripaksha in the foes, the enemies. Mitra friend, we all know Sarva Aramba parityagi. We have seen it before. And this is the most difficult one. He gives up all endeavors, all efforts. Sarva Aramba parityagi A small this is complete death.\n\nIf I stop doing everything, it's a complete death. I will stop all my endeavors and efforts when I die. Swamiji explained that's exactly what they're asking you to do.",

The one who watches the gunas is not bound by them.\n\nConsider what activities, foods, relationships, and environments increase sattva in your life. What increases rajas? Tamas? With this awareness, you can make wiser choices."

This Purusha which is imperishable, right now I consider it to be perishable because it is identified with this perishable body. So to make this connection with the Purusha and Prakriti at my individual level and at the universal level, we Learned in chapter 14 that the Purusha is the father of all the beings and Prakriti is the womb of all the beings in this world. So Prakriti is the mother and Purusha is the father.\n\nAny being which is born at any place to any womb. Bhagavan said, consider this great Prakriti is the womb and I am the Sid Giver Father. We see the variety of beings and things in this world that is explained by these three Gunas, the three binding ropes which bind this imperishable Purusha to this perishable manifestation. This variety of things and beings are created by the permutation combination of these Gunas, the three modes of material nature. This variety of things and beings around me create my Sansaar. My relationship with these things and beings is my Sansaar.\n\nThis Sansaar is ever changing Samsaratiyeti Sansaar. That which is constantly changing is Sansaar. Sansaar does not remain same. That which was there a minute ago has already changed. It has already passed. So we constantly are struggling with this ever changing Sansaar.\n\nThis Sansaar continues to grow. When I was just a single person and a student, my Sansaar were limited to me and my parents they get married. So now you have become two. Listen Salad, your problem plus her problem and then we have children. So not only my problem, her problem but also his problem. Few years ago when I used to go to India I used to have only three houses to visit my three brothers.\n\nNow when I go there, not only my brother's houses but their children they are married their in laws. So by the time I'm done with the 15 days are just gone to just meet with all their relatives. Because my Sansaar has grown. Bajagovindam says Bala hat Kira sakthah taruna tha tah vrudha tavat Chinta saktha When I was a child I was engaged in plays and toys. When I was a young man I was engaged in chasing girls. When I became old man, I'm just overwhelmed by worries.\n\nI said well why would that be? You should be relieved. So I was actually looking forward to an old age. Because I thought the old age means my children will be married. I will have no worries then I will be completely free. Now that I have become an old man, I realize how true that verse was.\n\nNot only I had to worry about myself, my family, my children, their children. So my Sansaar has grown so large. To detach from the Sansaar is increasingly becoming more and more difficult as the Sansaar grows. So this chapter opens up with the allegory of this Sansaar. So it says Urdhamoolah adha shakham asvattam prahuhu avyayam Chandansi Yasya Paranani Yastam Vedasa veda vith describing this Sansaar by using this allegory where it is like an upside tree. Now this allegory has been used in Upanishads in Katha Upanishads in the sixth portion of the Katha Upanishad the Lord of death Yama indicates to Nachiketa that this Sansaar is like the upside down tree.\n\nThe roots are in heaven and it is spreading in this world below. So my Sansaar right now is like that Urdhvamuna. Its source is up above. We always say anything which is higher say up Bhagavan kaha Upar. So this world as we see Bhagavad Gita and the Upanishad say the source is Apa. Source is somewhere beyond my perception.\n\nUrdhvamuna adas Sakaha all the branches are below. That which I see growing is here in my world. I see its effect, I don't see the cause. So in our normal tree, roots are not perceivable. They are not perceived. They are below under the ground.\n\nBut we see the trunk and we see the branches. And these branches continue to grow. And this Sansaar is like that. As we have learned a few lectures ago that the return in farming is thousand fold. So traditionally the farmers were the richest people. Even the kings were farmers.\n\nJanakaraja, while tilling the land, he found Sita because it was the most profitable business, most rewarding business. You sow one seed and thousand comes out. So the growth is exponential in anything in nature. So the tree grows exponentially. So my Sansaar is like that. It grows exponentially beyond my control.\n\nI do one action and it permeates thousand reactions. So the allegory used Yoga tree is something like that. That one action generates thousand connections in my Sansaar. And its source is Apaba Urdhvamulaha Adasakaha. I see the branches of my Sansaar here below. Prahuhu Abyam the wise people talk about this tree of Sansaar is something which has the roots above the branches below Chandansi, Yasya, Panani.\n\nThe Vedas are its leaves. Now this is something slightly off tune here because it becomes very difficult to connect. We have seen the commentaries by various scholars. Swamiji explains here. The Bhagavan Sankaracharya says that Asvathaha, the tree is explained as Asvathaha. Because Asvatha, that which does not remain same tomorrow you broke down Aswatha it becomes that which does not remain same tomorrow.\n\nTherefore this tree of Sansaar is explained as Asvathaha. And therefore that which promotes growth to this tree is the Vedas. The knowledge of Vedas, the instructions in Vedas, when followed by a person, his Sansaar grows healthily. By knowing this Sansaar and Prakriti, I more and more grow my Sansaar here. So these Vedas, the knowledge grows this tree of Sansaar in my life, in yours, in his Chandansi, Yasya, Pranani, Yastam, Vedasa, Veda Vid. And he who knows, he is a Veda knower.\n\nOne who knows both the roots and the branches of this tree, he knows the entire tree. So when I look at the tree I already know because I am a Veda knower of the trees that the roots are below in the ground. So There is a knowledge about where the roots are for the tree that makes my knowledge of the tree complete. So right now my knowledge of my Sansaar is incomplete. Because I only know what I see. So I only believe that what I see is the reality beyond my perception.\n\nI don't see there is reality. The other day we are explaining myth to Meda and say myth is something, a made up story to explain something. And she said okay then my English homework is a myth because it's made of stories in it. So we consider that seeing is believing. Everything I see as real is real. Everything else is myth.\n\nAnd therefore our knowledge is incomplete about this tree of Sansaar. I will know this tree of Sansaar completely when I know the roots, what the source of this tree of Sansaar is. That's why we are lacking for one side. So therefore I say one who knows this, he knows the Vedas. Vedas explain both the cause and effect. The roots and its tree.\n\nSo one who knows both is the Veda knower. Not the one who is only rooted in the Prakriti or this world. Only Yastam Vedasa Vedavid. Such a person knows the Vedas. Adhacha Urdhvam Prasuta Tashishaka, Guna Pravruddha, Vishe Pravalaha. So our Sansaar is now described using this allegory of a tree.\n\nSo that we understand how my world works. We talked about Prakriti in detail in last chapter but we have still stopped at. But these are the Gunas which are binding me and I need to go beyond these Gunas. Now we are learning about this Sansaar which is constantly changing. And how can I liberate myself from this Sansaar root? The cause for this is the Purusha.\n\nUnless there is consciousness, there is no Sansaar. How this Sansaar is rooted in this consciousness is what I'm trying to understand. That this tree grows in my world. Adha Cha Urdham, Prasuta Tashya Shah. Its branches are up and also below my world of ideas. Prakriti in the lower world where I live in.\n\nBut I also have ideas about the higher nature. So my ideas go both ways. They go up and they go down. I think about mundane thing but I also think about the sacred things. So my branches of my Sansaar is spreading in both directions in my Prakriti in my day to day life. But also what is beyond my day to day life.\n\nGuna Pravrudha, Vishaya pravalaha. These branches are nourished by the Gunas. They get more and more entangled into this prakruti. Bound by these Gunas I get more and more entangled in my world here because of the Gunas, my vasanas, my tendencies bind me to this world. My tendency is the music. So I somehow will always have to have some kind of a musical event because my Gunas is binding me.\n\nSo these Gunas are binding me into this world below. Guna pravruddha, vishaya pravalaha and the sense objects are the buds. So the sense objects have the potential to grow my Sansaar. If I see something which is of my liking then my Sansaar will grow in that direction. As we have seen that given opportunity I have this latent tendencies. And when a right environment is given to me, those tendencies will play out as first desires and then actions.\n\nSo if I don't have a chance, if there is no field then those tendencies will remain dormant. So I may be a nicest person if there is no opportunity given to me to get bribed. I have never taken bribe in my life but I may have tendency to take bribe which was never given an opportunity. The sense objects are bird. This opportunity presenting itself will then grow that tendency in me as desire and in actions. So the sense objects are the birds which has capabilities to grow my sansar in the directions of my tendencies depending on whether I'm a sattvic hemrajas, you go tamasic.\n\nThe sense objects will grow my Sansaar in that direction. Adaachar mulani anusanthatani and while I am functioning in this world bound by these Gunas, I am also developing my roots in this prakrit in this world. When we first moved to Richmond, because we moved from Northern Virginia, we were pretty active there. You know, we were running all these classes and all my friends, they say, Neil, it's not too far, only two hours. So anytime we have an event, you come down to Northern Virginia. So first about few months we did that, you know, they will have a music party and they will call me and we go down there, we will have music party, we call them and they come down here.\n\nGradually we started having roots here in Richmond. You know, we have friends here, our own group and we have classes. So now that we have grown our roots here in Richmond, we gradually get detached from this northern Virginia friends. Now they call me and say yeah, but I don't have time, I have activities here, I have classes here so I can Come.",
      "reflection": "Reflect on the image of the cosmic tree: roots in the infinite, branches in the finite world. You participate in both realms—anchored in something unchanging while engaging in the play of change.\n\nWhere in your life do you need to strengthen your connection to the roots? Where have you become too entangled in the branches?\n\nThe Gita teaches that wisdom is the axe that cuts attachment to this tree. What attachments are you ready to release?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 15. We have seen in last two chapters the nature of Prakriti. Chapter 15 is Purushottami Yoga, Yoga of the Supreme Purusha. So now we are learning about the nature of Purusha. So the chapter begins with explaining the tree of Sansar. That Sansar which I find it very real and that which I consider is the real reality is explained in the first three verses.\n\nSo it's a Urdhvamoolaha Adashakaha. The allegory used is of a tree because it exponentially growing. Just like a tree grows over a period of time. So this tree of my Sansar is growing exponentially. But its real picture given here is Urdhvamoolaha. The source of this tree is up above and the branches are below and the leaves are below.\n\nThis tree of Sansar is is growing in this world with the branches spreading all over. More I know about this Sansar, more this tree grows. More I know about things and beings. More my Sansar mind networking more people. I know my network grows. More people have relationship.\n\nMy network grows in this world, this Veda. The knowledge increases my Sansare and as my Sansar increase I start developing roots not knowing what my real source is because because the source is unavailable for me to see. So I develop roots here. More actions and more experiences that I have. It grows the roots here. So the actions are creating new channels in this world and then establishing me in this Sansar.\n\nI start thinking this is where I come from. I cannot find my real source. So I consider this Sansar as my source. So my roots are now growing in this world. And Bhagavan said that Naarupam Ashya iha Tatha Upalambita. Its overall form is not available to me.\n\nI cannot figure out how this Sansa started and how I got entangled into it. Naantah Nachadhi Nacha Samprateshta. I can figure out where it started, where it's going to end and how it is rooted in this world. Asvattam Enam Suvirudamulam if you want to know the overall picture. So we have learned before and said one who knows both he is the Veda Vida. One who knows the source and the Sansa.\n\nOne knows the Purusha and Parakriti together is the Veda with he is the knower of the Vedas. We know only _part of it. Like a Karmakanda actions. What we do in this world, we are aware of it but consider ourselves to be Gnani. But one says that's only partial knowledge. That's what actually binding me to this world.\n\nBecause I don't have complete knowledge. Veda describes both the Purusha and Prakriti. Therefore one who knows both is the Veda Vida. So to become Veda with you have to go beyond this perception of this Prakriti. Only with that acts of non attachment. What is binding in this world.\n\nWhat will release me from this world and give me overall picture is detachment. Therefore with that weapon of detachment firmly cut this tree. Tathaha Padam Tat Parim ar Gita Vyam Yasmin Gadhana Nivardanti Bhuyah. This statement comes over and over again in our scriptures. Tasmin Gada na Navaratanti Bhuyaha. One who goes there, he never comes back.\n\nBecause this life is just a one small _part of our existence. Our existence is infinite. It started from the way the world started. Now continue till the world ends. This life is just a small sliver of my existence. So I'm trying to resolve all my issues during this lifetime.\n\nBut you say it will be nothing but a continuation. End of this life will not be the end of anything. End of the life will be just a milestone. Move on to the next mile. But if I really want to resolve all that I want to resolve in this life, I need to go to a place where I don't have to come back again and again to resolve my issues. My issues are I'm trying to avoid unhappiness.\n\nI'm trying to go beyond sorrows. He said that can only happen if you go to a place where there are no sorrows or where there is no mortality. That place, that goal should be sought. Right now I'm seeking goals which are temporarily giving me happiness. My accomplishments, my acquirements, all these things are giving me happiness, but temporarily. So he said, if you want to go there, then you have to seek that goal.\n\nNow what is that goal? Tamevacha Adhyam Purusam Prapadyam Yat Pravrutvicha, Prasuta Purani. Then now I seek refuge in that primeval Purusha, that original source from which stream forth all the ancient activity. The real source of this activity, the Sansar, is the Purusha. Unless I'm conscious about my Jagat, my Jagat does not exist. Unless you are conscious, your Jagat, your Jagat does not exist.\n\nThis world exists as it is because we are aware of it. Bhagavan said from that source, the consciousness is the source from which all the activity started. My Jagat comes into being as soon as I become aware of it. If I'm not aware of it, it does not exist for me. So Bhagavan said that seek that place from which all the activities started, that consciousness. So he said, now my goal is that I seek refuge in that primeval Purusha from which all the activities have started.\n\nSo we have defined the goal. We have defined the Sansar. The Sansar seem like roots are here. As we say, wherever we settle down, we form our roots. So now that I'm in Richmond, my roots are in Richmond. I have forgotten all about my previous roots.\n\nPeople come from Northern Virginia. I don't have time for them. I come from India, but I go back and I feel uncomfortable there. All your formative years in your life were here. And suddenly you feel uncomfortable because you are detached from those roots. The things which we used to find so common, we can find anymore because we keep changing where we establish ourselves.\n\nBut once you establish yourself into your original source source, then you will not have to move around. We establish the goal that I need to take refuge in that primeval Purusha, the original source. And my original source, as I know is, everything that I know is because I'm aware of it. My consciousness is the source of all my experiences. My entire Jagat exists because I'm conscious. So I want to take refuge in that.\n\nSo then the next verse gives us the qualifications to be achieved or when will I be able to achieve that state? So it says, nirmana moha jita, sangha dosha, adhyatmanitya vinivratta kamah dwandwaihi vimuktaha sukhodukha sangehi gachanti amudaha padam aveyam tat. The six qualifications given here, they are something similar to we have learned before all throughout the Bhagavad Gita. And we have concluded already not possible. We Right away said this is not possible for us. So we move on to the next chapter.\n\nSo first was the Nirma na Moha. The one who is free from pride and delusion. Then Mana and Moha both my assessment of my situation and typically my assessment is overly liberal about myself. So Bhagwan said, Moha that over assessment of myself creates the delusion about my importance. Once I have correct assessment of myself then I will not have the delusion. So Mana my importance which I say can say without me the world cannot my company.\n\nI don't know what will happen if I'm not there tomorrow. This society cannot function unless I do this. That wrong perception that I am so important creates the situation which makes me unhappy. In the end all this impurities because of the attachment. My attachment creates the false perception. As we said, the people we like, no matter what they do, it's okay.\n\nSo the same event if you watch on Fox News will be completely different than you watch on msnbc. So you have the country is divided into two. One who watches Fox News and one msnbc. Because Sangha attachment. That attachment creates doshaha false perception of the reality. So you have to watch cnn.\n\nSo it is my attachment which is creating false perception which is creating dosha in my perception. Therefore Jita Sanga Dosha 1 is victorious over attachment and the stain which comes with it. Adhatma nityaha established in the self. Our mind obviously have to have something to attach to. Our mind cannot stay without any object to think about. Mind does not exist if you don't think about anything.\n\nTherefore in deep sleep there is no mind because there are no objects. In my deep sleep, I don't exist. In deep sleep, not the world exists. The mind does not exist in the deep sleep. As soon as I wake up, the mind rises because all the things which I associate with come into its perception. My house, my car, my family, my work, my job.\n\nVery first moment in the mind is active. So all this talk about jita sangha do saha I say not going to happen. Because more I try to avoid attachment, I get attached more. So Bhagavan said then you have to create an attachment which is so powerful that no other attachment can touch you. That attachment with your own self Adhyatmanity. Constantly remembering that I'm not this body, not this mind, not this intellect.\n\nThese are my equipment. This world is temporary but myself is permanent. That constant churning in your mind will give you the ability to detach from Other things. So adhyatmanity you are free from desires. My memory bank is the root cause of all the problems. That's why when we see somebody, we don't see him or her the way.\n\nRight now we remember everything. Our encounter with that person in the past. If the memory bank said the encounter was good, the person is good. The memory encounter wasn't that pleasant. The person is not good. So this memory bank creates ideas and then it creates a desire and the mind starts longing for it.\n\nIf we stop power of this memory bank to guide our perceptions, Bhagwanji will see things as they are. If I can judge a person from the day I'm looking at him it will be very different than all the baggage of all my experiences with him before. If you judge him from what he does today then it will be a very different perception. Even the person who is a big criminal. But once he resolved to be good, he should be considered good. Because he should be judged on what he's doing today not what he has done in the past.\n\nBut we obviously cannot function that way. We have to find all his resume what he did in the past and then only we can judge people. Bhagawan said vinavrutta kamaha if you don't do that, there won't be any desire to do anything which is not appropriate. Dvandvai vimuktaha we have learned this over and over again. It is the most difficult concept to understand. This is beyond pairs of opposites.\n\nThat does not mean the pairs of opposites go away. Pairs of opposites remain as they are. Sukha du kha mana apman they all remain exactly where they are. Winter and summer all those things remain. But I become indifferent to them. That's a dvandvai hi vimuktaha.\n\nJust like in the last chapter we have learned what is the first quality of a guna titaha. He's a Gunatidha one he does not despise when the gunas are present. Also he does not long for them and they are not present when Tamas is there and despise and seek sattva. But I take them as they are and not get attached to them. So therefore he said dhvandvayihi vimukta he is not affected by one or the other.",

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 15, Purushottam yoga, yoga of the Supreme Purusha, the Supreme being. In chapter 15, we have started out by realizing that that my own source, when I look at my life story and when I look at where did I come from and what is my world, it seem like Bhagavan says it's an upside down tree. It seemed like my source is somewhere up above. I right now cannot perceive where it is. Somewhere beyond my cognition, somewhere beyond my understanding, is my source. Urdu Moolaha Adasakaha.\n\nMy source is somewhere up above, but the branches and the leaves are in this world. And then it also seems like my roots are now getting established in this world. This is how I see myself and my world. I cannot find my source somewhere beyond my cognition, somewhere beyond my understanding. The self which I considered me has a source which I cannot recognize. And then we have seen that Bhagavan said that the perception of that is unavailable.\n\nKnowledge of my source, of that supreme Being is unavailable to most of us. But those who have achieved that sense of equanimity, nirmoha nisanga, those qualities which you have seen, jita sangha do saha, who have got over this evil of attachment, all these qualities which they have achieved, to them it is available the self which is immutable, imperishable. They recognize that the self in me is the self everywhere. Self in me, the self in everyone else. There is no other existence other than my own self. However, at this time it is not available to me and I have become the individualized ego.\n\nIt refers to my body, my mind, my intellect. So the verses which I have seen say, how did that happen? The ones who have the knowledge about the self, they know that the source of mind, that mulaha urdhva mulaha, that source of mind is in a place where there is no sun shining or moonkanish shining or there is a light of fire there. But once reaching that state, no one ever comes back to it. I particularly right now cannot see that as my world or myself. So how did that come about?\n\nThis ignorance came out. So Verse seven, the last one we had seen says Mama Eva Ansa Jiva Lokhe Jiva Bhuta ha Sanatanah. A eternal portion of mind establishing in this world of being, associating itself with the world of being becomes a Jiva Jiva Bhutah. When I associate myself with India Association, I become one of the member of India association just like every other member. I associate myself with Chinmaya mission. I become a Chinmaya mission member just like all other members.\n\nSo when this supreme also associate with the Jiva Loka, the Prakriti, he becomes one of the Prakriti. He becomes one of them. He becomes the Jiva Bhuta associating with the world of beings which, as we know, we have learned in the previous chapter 13 Bhagavan told Arjuna that idam shariram kaunteam kshatram iti abhidhiyate. This body is considered to be the field which is the Prakriti. And the one who knows this field is the knower of the field. So at my individual level, this field, the Prakriti is the body.\n\nOne who knows is the knower. Knower is the Purusha. Purusha functioning through the Prakriti. We have seen in the 14th chapter the qualities of the Prakriti. The Prakriti has three gunas. These gunas bind this Purusha to the Prakriti Satvaraja Santamas.\n\nSo right now myself, the consciousness in me is bound by this body, mind and intellect, by the qualities, the gunas of the body, mind and intellect. Now our goal in this chapter is to understand the nature of the Purusha. Therefore we are going through this exercise of knowing what is the nature of the Prakruti? What is the nature of the Purusha. So how did this ignorance came about? Is basically is our goal.\n\nSo he said, Bhagavan said Mama Eva asa a portion of mine eternal portion. Because once we say, the portion may be separated from that whole or something which once it gets separated, maybe get destroyed. This portion eternal of mine. Something which cannot be divisible but seem to be divided. We have seen the classic example of this space outside the room. Space is indivisible.\n\nNo matter how much we try. You cannot divide the space. However, it does seem divided between this room and that room and this space and kitchen and bathrooms. And because of the conditioning in a Similar manner, the supreme being, even though indivisible, seem like a portion of it, is divided from it and now associated with the Prakriti, becomes a jiva. Once it is now associated with Prakruti and becomes a jiva. Bhagavan said Manah, Sasthani, Indriyani, Prakruti, sthani, Karshati.\n\nOnce abiding in this Prakruti attracts or obtains the five senses in a mana. So now it has its own identity as this limited self associated with those six things it obtain which we call jiva. Those six are considered the internal instrument or Antahakaran Bahis karan is this body Antakarana, the six things. The Jiva that consciousness acquired its own equipment. And the next verse says so what's the now relationship with that equipment which is obtained by the portion of the jiva? So for example, in this case this room space is acquired.\n\nThe length and breadth and height of this room, this nature of this wall, floor and ceiling, they would define this room. And I'm leasing this room. In the lease I write down, this room is 20ft by 14ft. So many square feet has height of 8ft. Total volume is this. That's how the rent is decided.\n\nBut it is defined by what? By the wall, floor and ceiling. So now the Jiva defines itself as a limited being by the mind and the five senses, the six. So that's its equipment to function with the other jiva. So it's called antahakarana. Next we say Sariram Yat ava apnuthi, Yaatschaapi utkramati, Ishvaraha.\n\nSo he is now the Ishvara of my self, my consciousness. The my Ishvara, the Lord of my being is my consciousness. As long as I am conscious, I can speak, I can hear, I can touch, I can smell, I can taste. All this is possible only because of the consciousness in me. And therefore it is my Lord consciousness, my Lord, this Lord when obtains the body, this body, the gross body is something different than this mind and senses which you are saying. It obtained this where it requires in a vehicle.\n\nI have software, but my computer is now broken. All I need is new hardware. Now when it obtains a body, Yat chapi utkramati. When it leaves the body, it takes this subtle body with it. Now five senses, not the sense organs, the senses. I can see only when the mind is there.\n\nSo sometimes we are gazing but not seeing. We have all heard this before. We Are hearing but not listening. Because although the equipment is functioning properly, the translator, the mind is not there. Experiencer the mind is not there. This experiencer, the translator, is the internal instrument.\n\nThis verse says, when this Ishvara, the consciousness, right now, conditioned by this mind and senses, it leaves this body and obtains the body what it does. Grihitva etani samyati vayu gandha nivashayat. Just as air moves from one place to another, it carries the fragrance of the things which it touches, it carries with it. So that's why sometimes the air smells good when the air freshener. And if there is a toilet not properly cleaned, that smell also come through. Air does not discriminate.\n\nIt carries all the whatever comes with it. In the same way, the Ishvara, the consciousness, when it leaves this body or obtains a new body, it carries this six of them like a fragrance. Not in any fashion an actual experience, not in any fashion an actual sense organ, but just all the fragrance of what it has experienced, it carries with it. Therefore, when we move from one body to another, Bhagavan said, who carries those vasanas, Vasa Gandha, fragrance, vasanas. This collective accumulation of my experiences is the tendencies. So this was clearly says how the jiva was created.\n\nThe eternal portion, one portion of this whole supreme being identifying with this mind and intellect, becomes a jiva, conditioned consciousness. Now this conditioned consciousness, its own identity. Now it wants to exercise its desires and vasanas through a body. As long as it acquires the body, it unbundles the vasanas and start functioning. So some child, right from the beginning shows tendency for music, tendency for dance, tendency for mathematics, whatever that is. And some shows for the boxing that because those vasanas are carried with it, at least according to our shastras.\n\nSo when it leaves and obtains the body, so body is like a temporary abode. It takes over, uses it as long as they are functional. When it is non functional, moves on to the next one, but carries those vasanas, those collective experiences, the tendencies with it. The next verse says Shotram Chakshuhus parsanam charasanam granam evacha Thisthaya Manishchayam, vishaya anupasevate. So now what happens when I take new body? This jiva, the conditioned consciousness, having its own tendencies, unbundles its tendencies and uses this body to fulfill those desires acting in this field, which is appropriate for this.\n\nSo Bhagavan said Kshotram presiding over the ear, Chaksuhu the eyes sparsanam the touch with the skin Rasanam taste granam smell Thisayam manastya ayam and also the mind. This consciousness presiding over these five senses in the mind now enjoying the vishaya anupasevate. He now enjoys the sense object. I somehow want to go and get some music and enjoy it. You want to go and get ESPN and enjoy the sport. Depending on your vasana.\n\nLast verse we heard Saint says Utkra mantam sthitam va API bunjanamva Gonan vitham vimuda na anupashyamti Pashyamti gnana chaksusah utkravantam while living sthetam while it is staying in this body. API bunjanam va gunanvitam or enjoying by association with the gunas. This consciousness in me which is the Lord of my being, I do not recognize if I'm ignorant about it. I'm not recognizing that. The one who is enjoying is someone other than my body. One who is thinking is something other than my mind.\n\nOne who has the knowledge is something other than my intellect. I as the deluded person. Deluded in a sense that I do not have sense of reality. Deluded doesn't mean something. Someone who does not have sense of reality is deluded. So when David Cooperfield shows us that the Statue of Liberty is disappearing, we are not stupid, but we are deluded by his trick, by his illusion.\n\nSo one who is deluded doesn't know how that thing is happening. David Koperfilm and his staff knows exactly how it is happening. Because they have Gnana Chaksu. They know exactly how this thing is being done. We on the other hand, the television viewer do not know it. Therefore to us it's a wonderment how this thing is happening.\n\nFor the one who is not educated in this is Vimuda Nonupashyanti does not see that the Ishvara, the enjoyer of all this thing is a consciousness in me. Consciousness in me is the controller of the senses, mind and all this transaction which is taking place in my life Pashyanti Gnana chaksushu sah. But one whose eyes of knowledge is opened, one who has understood how it is this thing is working. He sees this and therefore what he seeks his goal even when he was deluded. When I'm deluded right now, still it is motive. My goal is I want peace.",

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 15, Purushottam yoga, yoga of the Supreme Spirit, the Supreme Purusha. We have talked about Prakriti. The Prakriti has three aspects, the Sattva, rajas and Tamas. And this permutation combination of the Sattva, Rajas and Tamas create this multiplicity in this world. When we associate with it, it creates a sansar I in the world. In that relationship, we get lost.\n\nAnd that relationship creates either the conducive experience or not conducive experience. Some gives us joy and some gives us unhappiness. So that's our Sansar. In that Sansar, we try to understand through various ways, to understand what gives me happiness, how can I achieve the permanent happiness. So, as we have seen before, our entire life is divided into two pursuits. One is to achieve happiness and other is to avoid unhappiness.\n\nSo this chapter starts with saying, well, let's understand how your Sansar starts. In the first place, place, it seems like it is rooted here, but its source is up above. Up above, in other sense, there's something which is beyond my perception, something which is beyond my understanding. From that source, this sansar grows and it is nourished by the Veda, the leaves and branches. The more I know about this sansar, more it grows, more I know about any subject, it becomes more and more complex. Even though my knowledge grows, my insecurity increases.\n\nThat there may be even a lot more that I do not know. More we know about the atom, less we know about the reality of what atom is all about physics. When it was limited, people can say, well, I have understood everything and I know now nothing more to be known. More we know more, it becomes complex. This Sansa is like that. This Sansar is the theme of all scriptural advice, the practices.\n\nSo this chapter tries to make this thing very clear to us that remaining in the Sansar, getting attacked to the Sansa will never be possible. So the very first advice in this chapter says, with the strong acts of detachment. Cut this tree of Sansar. Detach yourself from this Sansar. This is the only way to achieve that permanent happiness which you are seeking. And then we have discussed what is the nature of that self.\n\nIf I detach from this sensa, what am I getting attached to? You are getting attached to that supreme self. Having gone there, non returns. Once you have achieved that identification, there won't be any delusion. You will never come back to this ignorance. So as we had seen before, this Maya is created out of ignorance.\n\nMaya is called Maya because it gives an appearance of something that which is not. I always give example of David Copperfield and I thought he must have disappeared somewhere. But he was in news few days ago. He was in a courtroom explaining how the illusion works. So this is the first time he has to give the secret out and open court how he does that illusion because somebody got hurt. So it is an illusion.\n\nBut till we know how it happens, it's a mystery for us. So this Sansar is like that illusion that even though it seems so real, we all come to understand from the scriptures that it is an illusion. It is the Maya that wants to get out of this illusion. Then only so now anytime David Copperfield perform their act, we will not be in much much confusion. We know what's happening there. If you have that vision of both at the same time, you got it made.\n\nSo therefore is a one who understand both. One who can see this Sansar and the source of Sansar. He knows what the reality is. To get out of this ignorance which we think this Sansar is so real, you have to develop some mental capabilities. And we have seen those qualities. Nirmana moha, Jita sanga do saha.\n\nOne who is beyond the pride and whatever the opposite of that. And also jita sangha do saha who has a victory over attachment. We are trying to achieve that. But then we also want to understand what is the nature of myself. Then what is it that now considers that I as I am? And what is the relationship between the supreme self?\n\nSo we have learned that Mama Evansa Jiva lok Jiva Loki. The world of individual beings where each one considers himself or herself to be an individual. We all consider ourselves to be very complete individual, independent of each other. That's our general understanding. We think that I am by myself and the world is out there to compete with me. It's actually other way around.\n\nI am there because the world is there. The world is not there. But that's never a clear in our mind. So when one makes the connections, there's an all pervading supreme self which acts at the source of all the beings. When it comes to me as the individual, only a portion of that self associate with this mind and intellect. It basically, as we have seen, it draws the five senses and mind from the Prakriti.\n\nSo everything that I consider myself right now belongs to the Prakriti. My mind, my intellect, my body. And we have seen previously in detail how this works. That the body is made of the grossified element. The five elements which has come into it gross forms. So you can identify them as five different elements.\n\nAnd also we know where it comes from and where it goes. We know that the body is made of food. It's very simple for us to really follow this food chain. When I digested, it became my body. When I die, the same body will become food for somebody else. And the cycle continues.\n\nFor what is not simple for us is to understand the subtle body. We always thought, that's my consciousness, my mind and my intellectual are the thinkers who think. So we consider that as our real self which is driving this body to do what it does. The distinction here made is those are also part of the Prakriti, the inert nature. The nature is inert in all forms. It becomes sentient by association with the consciousness.\n\nJust like we know for sure that my eye cannot see. I know now very much. I know more about eye than I'm supposed to know. You know it basically no different than my glasses. So at least previously I had a God's given lens inside. Now I have both acrylic lenses on both sides and they are shifted.\n\nThe guy said, don't worry about it. So it is no different than any other thing which breaks down in my house, my clothes or whatever. You can repair it and make it good again. So this body, mind and intellect are from this inert world. It becomes sentient only when it is associated with the consciousness. As long as I am aware, my eye can see.\n\nAnd I am not aware of what's happening around my eye cannot see. We are seeing but not registering that what is there. Or we are hearing but not listening. Because the mind is not there. And mind itself also cannot do anything. Because it is made up of the inert material that material is.\n\nVedanta says before these five Elements were grossified, those five elements in the primordial state, they call it tanmatra. The mind and intellect are made. Those are still inert equipment, just like our body. But when the consciousness shines on that mind and intellect then mind and intellect become capable of interpreting the experience which is happening. So only when the consciousness is aware, I can see and mind can interpret even when I am alive. But when I am in deep sleep the mind and intellect are in dormant state because consciousness is not available to it.\n\nTherefore it cannot interpret any experience in deep sleep. Therefore I wake up and say I don't know, that I don't know. And I know is my entire world. So the avidy is the root cause of my confusion about who I am. So avidy is the part of Maya. So that avidy which is I don't know, will associate with the purusha which is all knowledge.\n\nThat portion of me comes to say I know. And that I know creates the notion that I, the individual know. So now I created an entity called jiva. That jiva, the consciousness identifying with the mind and intellect considering itself to be an entity by itself which is capable of knowing. So that jiva, when associated with the atma which is the pure consciousness is called jivatma. So mind and intellect identifying itself as the entity associating with the consciousness creates jivatma.\n\nThis jivatma remains intact as long as conditionings are there. Standard example that the room space, the space was always here. But this very fact that space was here attracted this somebody to build a building. Somebody who developer who has an idea about to create building, he sees this space and I can build a building here. So this space by its very existence attracted walls and floor and ceiling in this space. Now it created a room space, now it's the conditioned space.\n\nSo as long as this conditioning remains, the room space remains. So this mind and intellect once come in association with the consciousness. It identifies with this limited consciousness which it is reflecting through it becomes a jivatma. This jivatma experience this world through those five senses and the mind. Then we have seen that when this self leaves this body one thing is sure that we have seen people dying. So that's even that I will die too.\n\nSo what happens at the time of death is always a mystery to us. Bhagavan clarifies here that what happens here is that jivatma will leave this body carrying the fragrance with it off all the experiences and tendencies, all the fragrance of the mind and intellect which it has experienced through the senses, it will go with it. So atma Bhatt actually describes subtle body. So what dies is only the gross body. The subtle body leaves as jivatma because it is constantly identifying with the consciousness which is all pervading. It's like a mobile home or a car.\n\nThe space inside the car is identified with the car, but it's not the same space. It can move from here to Hanover county and still the car space it moved from Germany to United States. It's still the same car space. But now we know from our overall perspective it's not the same space when it is here. If the space belonged to Hendricko Hanover, it's a space belong to Hanover. But because the conditioning is moving, the space is omnipresent.\n\nWherever the conditioning moves, the identification moves with it. This jivatma associating with all pervading consciousness. When it moves from one body to another, it still identifies itself as an entity that is called a subtle body living so. So subtle body is the only thing which survives my death. And that subtle body is described in atma bodha. There is even 17 elements, five pranas, 10 senses, panchaprana dasa indriya, 15.\n\nThen mind and intellect mix 70. This 17 remained as a subtle body, not exactly the way we understand today. So not my eye is going to go with my sense of, but the capacity and ability to remember that experience will go along with it, that will then start its journey again. When I look at this experience, I think that is, when I die, my resistance will end. So the verses we have seen says, utkarabantam sthitamva API bunjanam va gonan vitamin vimuda na anupashyanti pashyanti gnana chakshushaha.",

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 15, Purushottama yoga, yoga of Supreme Being. And so far we have seen the Bhagavan saying that everything that you see, everything that you can perceive, and everything that you can experience is nothing but me. So, so in the last few verses we have seen, he said, the light which is from the sun which illumines this entire world of yours is nothing but my light comes from me alone. The light from the moonkanish which nourishes the plant is nothing but my own light. And the fertility in this soil which supports all the beings on this planet is nothing but me. You know, there was my mind, my intellect, which is aware of this world.\n\nThat awareness comes from him. And this world which I experience also comes from him. Then he says, not only that this being is supported by me, but all this functions within the sentient beings which makes them living beings. I support those functions. Aham Vaishva Narobhatva Prani Namdha Masridha. Residing in the bodies of all the beings, I digest these four types of food.\n\nBasically, as I said, our ancestors were obsessed with classification, so they always have some classification. The food, foods are four types of foods. And once you look at what the four types of foods are, there's nothing left. So any food that a being can eat, it gets digested. Bhagwan said, by me deciding, in this body is this eternal fire, this internal fire. So everything I see, everything I hear, everything I experience, there is really nothing other than the Lord.\n\nAnd this somewhat, if you really think logically fits into the normal belief, a normal declaration in all religion that the God is omnipresent. Once something we have taken as omnipresent, there is no room left for anything else. So if we say that God is omnipresent in this world, then there is no room for you and I as an individual other than God. As we have discussed so many times from the physics perspective, if I say I am omnipresent in my chair, there is no room for anything else or anybody else. So now everything in this chair has to be me. Whether it's my leg, it's my hand, my torso, whatever, it's all me.\n\nSo Bhagavan said, I am omnipresent. And therefore all the experiences illumined by your consciousness is nothing but me alone. So we have so far seen Bhagavan is giving his identity. What is the identity of the supreme Being? That there is none other than that being exist. So the last verse 14 we say prani nam deha masirithah prana pana samayukta Pachami annam Chaturvedam.\n\nI can see at the macro level the Lord is everywhere. At a micro level also in my body. This body, mind and intellect comes from this world. This world nothing but his expression. But the functions which I think differentiates me from this insentient world called matter. I consider myself something completely different than the matter.\n\nThat's why my body is so spatial. Because I don't think it's a matter. I consider that's me. But that me from the matter to me is because of these functions which makes me a living being. These pranas and apanas, all these activities happening in my body. And Bhagawan says that also I control by living in your body.\n\nIn the next verse it says, Sarvasya chaham Hrudhisan niveshtah matthaha smriti gnanam upo hanamcha vedeshcha sarve ham eva vedyo vedantakrut veda Videva chaham. So what is my relationship to the Lord now? He said, I am residing in the hearts of all beings. How do I know this great Lord is everywhere so it may overwhelm my intellect. I am a seeker seeking my experience or realization of my Lord. Now he says, I am the light of the sun is me, Light of the moonkanish is me.\n\nI am the fertility in the earth. Then we give up and talk. I will never be able to. Somebody says, Neil, if you want to do something, why don't you call up the President of vco President? If you tell me project manager, I can think about it. But make a cold call to President of United States Barack Obama.\n\nThat really doesn't sound like a practical thing to do. So we say, well, if Bhagavan is so supreme, then there is no way that I'll ever be able to get connected with him. So now Bhagawan said, no, that's not the truth. The truth is I'm residing in the hearts of all beings. Sarvasenni, Vistaha, Matthaha, Smrutihi, Gnanam and Upohanam. Because I'm residing in the hearts of all beings.\n\nAnd because of me they have a memory. Because of me they have knowledge. And because of me they have forgetfulness or ignorance. Everything which I know today is because of my consciousness. I'm aware of my experiences, so it becomes my memory. I'm aware of what I have learned.\n\nSo my memory has become my knowledge. If somebody says what month comes after January? Well, I learned in kg, it's February. That's nothing but my memory. I consider that as my knowledge. But it's actually my memory.\n\nAll this Bhagavan said comes from me. I will only remember if I'm conscious. Without that I won't. But more important than this knowledge is also forgetfulness. If I remember everything that happened, there won't be any room for me to learn anything new. IT guys were telling me, Neil, our server is really getting to the capacity now.\n\nWe had been in business for 12 years and we keep piling all this data on it. I think it's a time for you to change the server. It's 80% capacity you really have to have. So I said, well, I'll tell you what. We can't really afford a new server right now. Purge all the old projects which are done five years ago.\n\nI don't need them anymore. Pour them so I can put new projects onto my server. Forgetfulness is the gift from God to us. If we don't forget, we will not be able to learn anything. All the bad memories of our childhood literally get erased from us. That's why we also were childhood so good.\n\nMy college days were so good. Because the bad memories are erased. What you remember is all the fun you had. Now there are some bad memories that remain there. But most of it get erased. So I had a nice childhood when I was growing up.\n\nBecause the Bhagavan has given a gift of forgetting things which is not useful to you. Forgetting things which removes all the unnecessary ignorance out of your mind. So you can fill that void with new knowledge. Sarvasya Chaham Rudhisa Nivestaha. I am residing in the hearts of all. So we obviously in my heart Bhagavan is here.\n\nSwamiji makes it clear. And obviously you and I can logically say heart is not that physiological organ. Literally Pumping the blood. It is the core of my being. What I consider me is my heart. What is at the heart of the Richmond city?\n\nWhat is at the heart of this community? What I consider the core of my being. Bhagavan said, I reside there. The core of my being is my awareness about me. My awareness about me, makes me who I am. That has these good qualities about compassion, charity, love.\n\nBut once I decide in there, when my God is invoked then I will have this good quality manifest. When I am in a divine mood, then I will have love, compassion, charity, all the good qualities. When I am forgetting about my Lord, my being, then I will have all the negative qualities. Because those negative qualities are the product of my ignorance. I hate somebody, I'm evil to someone. All these things are because of the lack of my connection with my core of my being, my heart, my Lord who makes me who I am.\n\nSo Bhagavan says, Sarvasyacham, Hrudhi Sanniveshtah. I am residing in all the beings at the core of their heart. When I am really aware of myself, I can only manifest my divine qualities. Love, compassion, charity. Whatever the good qualities we think of, it's only when I'm devoid of those connections then I will have jealousy, hatred. They said matthaha smritihe.\n\nBecause of me is the memory. Because of me is the knowledge. Because I'm aware of myself, I have a memory. Because I'm aware of myself, I have a knowledge. And because I'm aware of myself, I have forgetfulness. I am also our ignorance.\n\nI am as much aware of my knowledge. I am also as so much aware of my ignorance. Neel, do you know medicine and know nothing about it? Do you know architect, tell me all about it. I am aware of my knowledge. I am also aware of my ignorance.\n\nBhagavan said, it's all because of my presence in you, the consciousness. I reside in you as your being. I am the Vedas and I am that needs to be known. I am the author of the Vedanta and knower of the Vedas. Now Vedas, as we have seen, they are our scriptures. What do they represent?\n\nThey represent knowledge. The knowledge compiled by the sages becomes Veda. This knowledge encompass everything. Utilitarian knowledge as well as the divine knowledge, secular as well as sacred. Now the secular knowledge obviously also come from my awareness. I learn things and I use it.\n\nI am all this knowledge that is out there. And I am only the one to be known. And Veda in the end says what? The only thing to be known is your own self. Once you realize yourself, there is nothing more to be known. Having reached that place, we have learned that no one comes back.\n\nThat's what Veda says. That's what Vedanta said. In the end of Veda, the section which deals with the Upanishads and the knowledge about yourself is called Vedanta. So who gave this knowledge of the self to the Rishis? Bhagavan said, I did. And therefore there is no authorship in our Vedas of who wrote this Vedanta.\n\nThere is no authorship because it is a revealed knowledge. That is what is remembered. So I can say I thought about it many times. Honestly, I can tell you, I give some examples in my lectures. And I really sometimes feel good that I really thought about really neat example. Then I read Swamiji's commentary and I find the exact same example in it.\n\nI said, how did that happen? I thought, I thought about it. What I really forget is I'd been listening to Swamiji since I was 16 years old. So all this thing which I think, I'm thinking fresh, new is literally come from what I heard since I was 16 year old. Now, I may not have understood the time, I may not have got the gist of it at the time, but things stay with you. Then we are really churning on that idea.\n\nThings come out and now you think, I invented this idea. And therefore in Hinduism there is no originality. The only originality is with him. Everything else we do is just relearn. So Bhagavan says, therefore I am the author of Vedanta. Now I am the one to be known.\n\nEverything which I can consider is the quest of my life. If Bhagavan said, is me, know that I am at the core of your being. So how difficult would it be for you to know your core of your being? Not that difficult, Bhagavan said, as long as you turn your gaze towards yourself. So these verses are obviously very contemplative verses and not really intellectual verses, but contemplative verses. But going back to our understanding of what is real, what is unreal, what is transitory or temporary, and what is permanent.",

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 15, Purushottama yoga, yoga of Supreme Being. And so far we have seen the Bhagavan saying that everything that you see, everything that you can perceive, and everything that you can experience is nothing but me. So, so in the last few verses we have seen, he said, the light which is from the sun which illumines this entire world of yours is nothing but my light comes from me alone. The light from the moonkanish which nourishes the plant is nothing but my own light. And the fertility in this soil which supports all the beings on this planet is nothing but me. You know, there was my mind, my intellect, which is aware of this world.\n\nThat awareness comes from him. And this world which I experience also comes from him. Then he says, not only that this being is supported by me, but all this functions within the sentient beings which makes them living beings. I support those functions. Aham Vaishva Narobhatva Prani Namdha Masridha. Residing in the bodies of all the beings, I digest these four types of food.\n\nBasically, as I said, our ancestors were obsessed with classification, so they always have some classification. The food, foods are four types of foods. And once you look at what the four types of foods are, there's nothing left. So any food that a being can eat, it gets digested. Bhagwan said, by me deciding, in this body is this eternal fire, this internal fire. So everything I see, everything I hear, everything I experience, there is really nothing other than the Lord.\n\nAnd this somewhat, if you really think logically fits into the normal belief, a normal declaration in all religion that the God is omnipresent. Once something we have taken as omnipresent, there is no room left for anything else. So if we say that God is omnipresent in this world, then there is no room for you and I as an individual other than God. As we have discussed so many times from the physics perspective, if I say I am omnipresent in my chair, there is no room for anything else or anybody else. So now everything in this chair has to be me. Whether it's my leg, it's my hand, my torso, whatever, it's all me.\n\nSo Bhagavan said, I am omnipresent. And therefore all the experiences illumined by your consciousness is nothing but me alone. So we have so far seen Bhagavan is giving his identity. What is the identity of the supreme Being? That there is none other than that being exist. So the last verse 14 we say prani nam deha masirithah prana pana samayukta Pachami annam Chaturvedam.\n\nI can see at the macro level the Lord is everywhere. At a micro level also in my body. This body, mind and intellect comes from this world. This world nothing but his expression. But the functions which I think differentiates me from this insentient world called matter. I consider myself something completely different than the matter.\n\nThat's why my body is so spatial. Because I don't think it's a matter. I consider that's me. But that me from the matter to me is because of these functions which makes me a living being. These pranas and apanas, all these activities happening in my body. And Bhagawan says that also I control by living in your body.\n\nIn the next verse it says, Sarvasya chaham Hrudhisan niveshtah matthaha smriti gnanam upo hanamcha vedeshcha sarve ham eva vedyo vedantakrut veda Videva chaham. So what is my relationship to the Lord now? He said, I am residing in the hearts of all beings. How do I know this great Lord is everywhere so it may overwhelm my intellect. I am a seeker seeking my experience or realization of my Lord. Now he says, I am the light of the sun is me, Light of the moonkanish is me.\n\nI am the fertility in the earth. Then we give up and talk. I will never be able to. Somebody says, Neil, if you want to do something, why don't you call up the President of vco President? If you tell me project manager, I can think about it. But make a cold call to President of United States Barack Obama.\n\nThat really doesn't sound like a practical thing to do. So we say, well, if Bhagavan is so supreme, then there is no way that I'll ever be able to get connected with him. So now Bhagawan said, no, that's not the truth. The truth is I'm residing in the hearts of all beings. Sarvasenni, Vistaha, Matthaha, Smrutihi, Gnanam and Upohanam. Because I'm residing in the hearts of all beings.\n\nAnd because of me they have a memory. Because of me they have knowledge. And because of me they have forgetfulness or ignorance. Everything which I know today is because of my consciousness. I'm aware of my experiences, so it becomes my memory. I'm aware of what I have learned.\n\nSo my memory has become my knowledge. If somebody says what month comes after January? Well, I learned in kg, it's February. That's nothing but my memory. I consider that as my knowledge. But it's actually my memory.\n\nAll this Bhagavan said comes from me. I will only remember if I'm conscious. Without that I won't. But more important than this knowledge is also forgetfulness. If I remember everything that happened, there won't be any room for me to learn anything new. IT guys were telling me, Neil, our server is really getting to the capacity now.\n\nWe had been in business for 12 years and we keep piling all this data on it. I think it's a time for you to change the server. It's 80% capacity you really have to have. So I said, well, I'll tell you what. We can't really afford a new server right now. Purge all the old projects which are done five years ago.\n\nI don't need them anymore. Pour them so I can put new projects onto my server. Forgetfulness is the gift from God to us. If we don't forget, we will not be able to learn anything. All the bad memories of our childhood literally get erased from us. That's why we also were childhood so good.\n\nMy college days were so good. Because the bad memories are erased. What you remember is all the fun you had. Now there are some bad memories that remain there. But most of it get erased. So I had a nice childhood when I was growing up.\n\nBecause the Bhagavan has given a gift of forgetting things which is not useful to you. Forgetting things which removes all the unnecessary ignorance out of your mind. So you can fill that void with new knowledge. Sarvasya Chaham Rudhisa Nivestaha. I am residing in the hearts of all. So we obviously in my heart Bhagavan is here.\n\nSwamiji makes it clear. And obviously you and I can logically say heart is not that physiological organ. Literally Pumping the blood. It is the core of my being. What I consider me is my heart. What is at the heart of the Richmond city?\n\nWhat is at the heart of this community? What I consider the core of my being. Bhagavan said, I reside there. The core of my being is my awareness about me. My awareness about me, makes me who I am. That has these good qualities about compassion, charity, love.\n\nBut once I decide in there, when my God is invoked then I will have this good quality manifest. When I am in a divine mood, then I will have love, compassion, charity, all the good qualities. When I am forgetting about my Lord, my being, then I will have all the negative qualities. Because those negative qualities are the product of my ignorance. I hate somebody, I'm evil to someone. All these things are because of the lack of my connection with my core of my being, my heart, my Lord who makes me who I am.\n\nSo Bhagavan says, Sarvasyacham, Hrudhi Sanniveshtah. I am residing in all the beings at the core of their heart. When I am really aware of myself, I can only manifest my divine qualities. Love, compassion, charity. Whatever the good qualities we think of, it's only when I'm devoid of those connections then I will have jealousy, hatred. They said matthaha smritihe.\n\nBecause of me is the memory. Because of me is the knowledge. Because I'm aware of myself, I have a memory. Because I'm aware of myself, I have a knowledge. And because I'm aware of myself, I have forgetfulness. I am also our ignorance.\n\nI am as much aware of my knowledge. I am also as so much aware of my ignorance. Neel, do you know medicine and know nothing about it? Do you know architect, tell me all about it. I am aware of my knowledge. I am also aware of my ignorance.\n\nBhagavan said, it's all because of my presence in you, the consciousness. I reside in you as your being. I am the Vedas and I am that needs to be known. I am the author of the Vedanta and knower of the Vedas. Now Vedas, as we have seen, they are our scriptures. What do they represent?\n\nThey represent knowledge. The knowledge compiled by the sages becomes Veda. This knowledge encompass everything. Utilitarian knowledge as well as the divine knowledge, secular as well as sacred. Now the secular knowledge obviously also come from my awareness. I learn things and I use it.\n\nI am all this knowledge that is out there. And I am only the one to be known. And Veda in the end says what? The only thing to be known is your own self. Once you realize yourself, there is nothing more to be known. Having reached that place, we have learned that no one comes back.\n\nThat's what Veda says. That's what Vedanta said. In the end of Veda, the section which deals with the Upanishads and the knowledge about yourself is called Vedanta. So who gave this knowledge of the self to the Rishis? Bhagavan said, I did. And therefore there is no authorship in our Vedas of who wrote this Vedanta.\n\nThere is no authorship because it is a revealed knowledge. That is what is remembered. So I can say I thought about it many times. Honestly, I can tell you, I give some examples in my lectures. And I really sometimes feel good that I really thought about really neat example. Then I read Swamiji's commentary and I find the exact same example in it.\n\nI said, how did that happen? I thought, I thought about it. What I really forget is I'd been listening to Swamiji since I was 16 years old. So all this thing which I think, I'm thinking fresh, new is literally come from what I heard since I was 16 year old. Now, I may not have understood the time, I may not have got the gist of it at the time, but things stay with you. Then we are really churning on that idea.\n\nThings come out and now you think, I invented this idea. And therefore in Hinduism there is no originality. The only originality is with him. Everything else we do is just relearn. So Bhagavan says, therefore I am the author of Vedanta. Now I am the one to be known.\n\nEverything which I can consider is the quest of my life. If Bhagavan said, is me, know that I am at the core of your being. So how difficult would it be for you to know your core of your being? Not that difficult, Bhagavan said, as long as you turn your gaze towards yourself. So these verses are obviously very contemplative verses and not really intellectual verses, but contemplative verses. But going back to our understanding of what is real, what is unreal, what is transitory or temporary, and what is permanent.",
      "reflection": "Reflect on the image of the cosmic tree: roots in the infinite, branches in the finite world. You participate in both realms—anchored in something unchanging while engaging in the play of change.\n\nWhere in your life do you need to strengthen your connection to the roots? Where have you become too entangled in the branches?\n\nThe Gita teaches that wisdom is the axe that cuts attachment to this tree. What attachments are you ready to release?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 15, Purushottama yoga, yoga of the Supreme Purusha. We have heard these terms before in Bhagavad Gita and Vedanta, Purusha and Prakriti. We understood from this discussion that the Prakriti is the manifest. Anything that which I can see, touch, feel and vouch for its existence is Prakriti, including my thoughts, my ideas. Because other people may not be able to vouch for, I can vouch for it that they exist. Anything that exists in the realm of my perception, feeling in thoughts is a Prakriti.\n\nBut that which supports this Prakriti or awareness is the Purusha. I am aware of this Prakriti because I am alive. If I am not alive, this body cannot perceive whether it is day or night. So that conscious principle in me is a Purusha. That's what we understood. The Prakriti is changing every minute, every second.\n\nAt a micro level, my body. My body has been changing every minute. I may not realize it till I see my pictures from five years ago. One good thing about these pictures on a website, we never change it. So I have a picture which was taken in 2003 on my website and anywhere else. So when the people come in contact with you in person, they get shocked.\n\nNeil, you know, look a little different. Well, I never realized it. But other people who say it or when we see our picture, we realize this is constantly changing. What it was yesterday is not today. So that falls into the category of a perishable things and beings. This body is perishable.\n\nBut this body is supported by something which remains constant. This change I'm noticing in my body because something remains constant. That constant factor is gauging the change. I used to look like this. I used to have all dark hair, all my beard was dark. That one who notices the change remains constant.\n\nThat the support for this change. Change can only takes place if there is something constant. So in my life, I, the consciousness, I, the awareness is constant. So when we remember Our childhood memories we don't think that that was something a different person. I remember this happened to me I remember that I remain constant. Everything else about me keeps changing.\n\nSo at my micro level there are two purusas two me One is perishable which is the body, mind and intellect One is imperishable which is the one who is aware of these changes One who is afraid of death Otherwise why would I be afraid if there is not someone watching it and say looks like this body is going to go out. People ask me all the time now Neil, what's your plan? I said what do you mean what's my plan? He said we're talking about retirement. I said I have no plan because I feel the way I felt when I started NBG architecture the very first day I'm the same person you're going to be qualified for Medicare in a couple of months so I'm sure you have some plan. And at that time I started thinking oh is that so?\n\nStatistically Indians don't really last longer than somewhere about early 70s that's 65. I probably have less than 10 years if I have less than 10 years I haven't even planned what I'm going to do because I as I never feel old that I at my level is always be imperishable. We started out this chapter by saying that I when I think about myself it seems like my source is somewhere unknown up above but my life is all here spread all around it the same I now I look at it that when Bhagavan talked about the nature of the Supreme Being is that everything that you see, perceive and feel is nothing but my expression Right now I'm only worried about me. I'm not worried about whether you're going to retire or she is going to retire or he's going to retire what am I going to do? I'm also not worried about whether you people will be around when I die and after I die I'm only worried about what will happen to me. So at my level Bhagavan said in this Loka DHV Purushav There are two Purushas in this world.\n\nIn my world there are two Purushas One which is perishable that I see Bhagavan said nothing that you see is other than me. I only exist and pervade everywhere. Everything you see, touch, feel and perceive is nothing but my expression including perception of my own body, mind and intellect which is deteriorating. I can't remember even My employee who has just left me three days ago. And so you know, she used to work here. Because the memory is not now as good as it used to be.\n\nSo I see this perishable me which is also the Purusha. And I also see the imperishable one who doesn't think about the retirement even now. Dhwa Imam Purusha, in this loka of mine, in this world of mine, there are two Purushas. One is perishable, one is imperishable. Is the world ends here for me? Beyond these two, there is a supreme Purusha.\n\nRight now that supreme Purusha I really have no connection with. So therefore I'm only worried about this Purusha. The one I feel is imperishable. Whatever I feel is still as young as when I used to be a little child. Bhagawan said that beyond these two there is a Purusha which transcends both the imperishable and perishable. And the example which we have seen is this room space is imperishable.\n\nRoom, walls, floor and ceiling is perishable. We are doing some renovation next door. So we say I'll move this wall here and do this because that's perishable. But we know that the space itself is imperishable. In relationship to the wall, floor and ceiling, this space is imperishable. But if we remove this walls, floor and ceiling out of the equation, what happens to this imperishable space?\n\nIt's not even imperishable anymore. If there is no perishable things in this world, the word imperishable means nothing, right? Because it is imperishable compared to perishable thing. Long lasting battery. Short lasting battery, Lifetime warranty. Battery's life or the manufacturer's life?\n\nOr that company's life? All of our contractors, we ask them we need 10 year warranty or 15 year warranty. 20 years warranty guy gladly give. 5 years from now you'll try to call him and say we have problem, we need you to. The phone number is out of service. So the lifetime warranty we get is not your lifetime, it's the lifetime of the company.\n\nAs long as companies, the warranty is good. But all these things are relative. But if you take the relationship out, what remains is absolute which you cannot really compare in this world. So this Purusha, one is perishable, this body one is imperishable. Which is conditioned by this body, mind and intellectual. But if you remove the conditioning, what remains is absolute Purusha which is neither perishable nor imperishable but ever existing.\n\nAnd that Bhagavan said is by nature. So he said Uttamahapuru Sahatu Annyaha Paramatma ITI Udahrutah. We heard the word Paramatma. What does paramatma means? My atma is imperishable compared to my self. The body, mind, intellect.\n\nBut if I don't have this body, mind, intellect, that atma is absolute. Therefore it is param Atma. Not in reference to this. Our idea is that imperishable. Bhagavad Gita said that I'm imperishable. Even if I die, I'll be nil bhatt somewhere.\n\nBhagavan said Paramatma, it will be part of the infinite. Therefore that supreme being which forms this being as me is a paramatma. Swamiji gives a very nice example. Even within a room space there is a pot space. The space in the coffee cup is room space. The space remains in the room.\n\nBut when I even remove the room, the whole room space becomes so. When we take these layers out of identification, this is my mind, this is my body, this is my intellectual. They have their own identity and then I have my identity. The I which is my mind, my body, my intellect. When you remove in this I, what remains is just an absolute self. My atma, not conditioned by my limitations is Paramatma.\n\nYour lokatriyam Avishya Bibhartya via Ishvaraha. That Paramatma is supporting the three worlds I live in my three worlds. Waking dream and deep sleep. My waking world is different. My dream world is different and my deep sleep world is different. I, the conditioned self is going through all these three experiences in my life.\n\nBut the condition self is supported by whom? This room space is bigger, smaller, depending on where I put the walls here. But supported by what? By the universal space. This is a part of that universal space. Yasmaat Aksharam Atito Aham Aksarat Apicho Uttamah.\n\nTherefore Bhagavan's Yasmat Aksharam Adith. This self is even beyond imperishable. This self in me is much greater than this perishable Me. That's what we take some solace in learning Bhagavad Gita that even if I die, I will not die. Bhagavan said, but that self is even beyond Aksharaha. Beyond this imperishableness.\n\nImperishable as we have seen is only reference to the perishable. So let's say my life is hundred years. But there are things here which are 5000 years old. Compared to me, that thing has existing forever. But this time frame, when we completely remove the scale from our mind, what remains is absolute existence. No past, no present, no future.\n\nSo Bhagavan said Yashmat Aksharaati Tahm beyond imperishable and perishable. I am even supreme than this perishable and imperishable. Ataha Asmi Lokethah Purushottamaha. We had been hearing this word Purushottama. What is that Purushottama? He said, because my real nature I the Lord the Ishvara and I say Lordship is that which supports my existence is my Lord.\n\nThat's when we call King a Lord. Because my existence as the commoner is because of his grace. He allows me to do that. That's why he's the Lord. In this case my Lord is him. Because my existence is because of him.\n\nTherefore in this world I am called Purushottama in the Vedas. Purushottama is described in Vedas as the one which is beyond perishable and imperishable. And also the scholars and poets in this world has sung its glory as something beyond perishable and imperishable. And therefore Bhagavan said, I am called Purushottama. Therefore this chapter was called Purushottama Yoga. Yoga of Purushottama.\n\nRight now I am completely yoked with this perishable and imperishable Purusha. I am very aware this is perishable me. I also know this body is going to die. But I have complete identification with it. I also have some solace because I had been learning Bhagavad Gita for many, many, many years. That something within me is imperishable.\n\nBhagavan said, but I am Purushottama. I am beyond this perishable imperishable. Therefore I am called Purushottama, my own self. When drops relationship with this body, mind and intellectual, this world, this perception, this feeling, these thoughts becomes Purushottama. Yo Mam Eva Samudaha Janati Purushottamam who knows his self as Purushottama One who Asamuda, one who is undeluded. We are, whether we like it or not, are deluded, fooled by the illusions that you are different than I am and she is different than he is.\n\nNo matter how hard we try, this conditioning is so complete that we will not be able to get out of it. R. Bhagavan said there is a state for a Gyani to go beyond this illusion or delusion that he sees all the time that his relationship is with the Purushottama and not with this Purusha.

      "commentary": "We have completed chapter 15 and we'll be discussing chapter 16 now. And so far in Bhagavad Gita, we have seen in the first six chapters who we are as the limited beings. Then the next six chapters we have seen, what is the nature of of the Lord, the one, the Bhagavan which I'm seeking? In the last three chapters, which is chapter 13, 14 and 15, we had been seeing how to differentiate the two and how to go from one to the other, from manhood to godhood. So the first thing we have learned in chapter 13 is how to differentiate between the field and its knower. Because right now we have a confusion about what is field and what is knower.\n\nI, the knower, think the world is the field. Even your body, mind and intellect which you consider you, is actually part of the field. One that knows this field is the Knower. So you've seen the differentiation between the knower and the field. We also come to the conclusion in that chapter. The knower is only one.\n\nWhether it knows to you, knows through me, knows through him, knows through her, Knower is only one. The field has many expressions which we call it a Prakriti. The variety of manifestations in the Prakriti creates individuality. Same knower functioning through these different manifestations creates individuality called ego. Each ego thinks he or she is the Knower, knower remaining the one. So now the question arises for a seeker who is sincere is if the Knower is one, why my knowledge is different than your knowledge and your knowledge is different than his knowledge.\n\nSo in the last chapters we have seen the qualities of the Prakriti 3 Guna. The Prakriti having these three qualities of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas, depending on whatever the permutation combination of these three gunas in that particular individual, as the light shines through that equipment, the result will be according to the nature of that equipment. So these three gunas create various perception of the reality. Reality Remaining the same, you see differently and I see it differently. Something which is quite obvious to you becomes soul intriguing for me. And something so intriguing to you becomes so obvious to me.\n\nThat's because of the nature of our equipment. So to reach that transcendental self which we have seen in chapter 15, the Purushottama. So we've seen there are three levels of recognizing the Aloluptvam pervading self. First level is the perishable one which we Aloluptvam can identify as myself, yourself, this world, my children, your children, my family, your family. We see that as a perishable world they come into being and will go away. But because we have come to the conclusion that there is only one entity which exists which is the omnipresent Lord, even this transitory manifestations are also nothing but his self.\n\nAnd therefore we call it a perishable Purusha Akshara Brahman. The next we say the Akshara, one who knows these changes are happening in me, in you, in him, in her is the imperishable self. So I know that my body is decaying, my mind is losing its grip, my intellect is fading. But the one who knows these changes are happening is imperishable in me. Therefore that's we call it the conditioned imperishable self. This body is the outward expression which is perishable.\n\nOne who knows this body is decaying is the imperishable self. But we learnt in the last chapter, the Supreme Being transcends the both the perishable and imperishable. And therefore he is called Purushottama Supreme Purusha, Supreme Being. Because the qualifications of perishable imperishable are invalid at that point, knowledge is only in reference to ignorance. I can say my knowledge of English language started when I was in fifth standard because in reference to that knowledge I was ignorant. Before my fifth standard I was ignorant about my knowledge of English.\n\nBut if there is no ignorance ever, the knowledge has no meaning. Or if there is no knowledge to be known, the ignorance has no meaning. Ignorance about my own tail has no meaning because I don't have a tail. So when you remove the both perishable imperishable, what remains is the Supreme Being, the Purushottama. Having understood this intellectually, we have a difficulty grasping these ideas. So now the chapter 16 starts with the qualifications required to purify your mind and intellect to reach the level of clarity so that the knowledge of the supreme self shines through automatically.\n\nIt also talks about what is right now stopping this knowledge for me to recognize what are the impurities which is veiling this truth from me. My own self is not very evident to me right now. My own self I'm seeing through my colored glasses of identification with my body, mind and intellect. I do recognize I exist. I do recognize that no one else have to come and convince me that I exist. But that existence I can only perceive in terms of my body, mind and intellect.\n\nSuch as I know the space exists and I can perceive this space as room space. But only as long as the walls, floor and ceilings are there, I can perceive room space. You remove Aloluptvam objects from this world. Perception of space is very difficult. So right now I do recognize myself. But in the context of my body, mind and intellect, I want to transcend this relationship.\n\nHow do I transcend is to make my internal instrument Antaha Karana, mind intellectual, Antakarana, Siddhi, Purity of mind and intellect. So in Vedanta, the whole mankind is divided into three categories. People who are divine, those who have developed the divine qualities of mind and intellect called Devas. Those are called Asuras who have demonic qualities which brings you down to this world and binds you to this world. Then there are completely ignorant, completely indifferent about what is good and bad called Rakshasas. And the goal of Bhagavad Gita is to help everyone.\n\nSo goal of Bhagavad Gita is just like our president said that I'm not only the president of the 51% who voted for me. I'm also a president of the 49% did not vote for me. I'm a president of 100% of Americans. My goal as a president is to help each and every American whether who voted for me or not. So Bhagavad Gita is like that. See, normally say Bhagavan will only help you if you pray to him.\n\nBhagavan will only do if you do good things. Bhagwant, my goal is to help Aloluptvam of you. Whether you are a divine, you are Asura, demonic or you are Rakshasi. Completely ignorant now. Completely ignorant ones. There is no help readily available.\n\nThey have to go through the adversity of nature to destroy this mold in which their mind and intellect is right now imprisoned. And to break that mold so they can get out of that. So that's why we say some criminal, we can understand why they did this. But then this law of the society or the law of the nature or law of some divine force will break their mold for them. There is no advice given in this chapter but the rest of Us either fall into demonic or divine qualities. This chapter gives us guidance.\n\nSo the purpose of this chapter is the topics we have already discussed before. We have indication in chapter seven and chapter nine about people who have the knowledge will understand this, but people with the deluded intellect will not understand that. Now we have a chance to elaborate on them and see what are the qualities I can introspect in myself which I need to cultivate more and one which I need to negate. So the chapter starts with Sri Bhagavan Oacha Bhagavan directly comes out and gives this knowledge without any introduction to it. Abhayam Sattva Sansuddhi Gnana Yoga, Vivasthidhi Dhanam Damasta Yagnascha Swadhyayavam. We have seen this in first three verses that 26 divine qualities are enumerated for you and I to use it as the litmus test.\n\nHow many of these I have now most of us write up well, these are for saintly people, not for me. However, if you carefully look at it, Aloluptvam of these are in you. You practice Aloluptvam 26 of them in your daily life at some level. But now it is our turn to look at these qualities. And what we have latently is our ability to cultivate it. So it becomes my own personality.\n\nSo the first time I say Abhayam fearlessness. Now we know where the fear comes from. Out of ignorance, when I am not comfortable about the situation, I am fearful. One time I took Chamberlain Exit. Somehow I thought I'm going towards vcu. I ended up on the other side.\n\nAnd as I drove further I started getting more and more nervous about how can I take a short turn. Why I never been to that neighborhood ever before. Getting lost in West End is no big deal. I get lost in West End sometime, try to take a shortcut and then can't find a way out of that neighborhood. But I'm comfortable because I know this neighborhood, other side of Chamberlain Avenue. I did not know, so I was fearful.\n\nFear comes from ignorance. Therefore when someone who doesn't look like me, doesn't talks like me, does not dress like me, I am fearful of him. So Bhagavan says Abhayam, the first quality to be developed is Abhayam. And Abhayam comes from that basic understanding that no matter what the outward expression of the thing or being is, it is Lord's expression. So how far that expression is from me, as far as I am from my own self, there is nothing to fear in this world. So Bhagawan said Abhayam is the first quality a seeker develops.\n\nWe have heard that Alexander going back and he wanted to take Saint who was and said well you come with me. Are you not afraid of me that I can kill you? You can't take anything from me and you can't do anything to me. So I'm not afraid of you no matter who you are. He had nothing to lose. If I had no fear of losing anything nobody can make me afraid of him or her.\n\nSo Bhagavan said Abhayam the first quality a seeker develops is the Abhayam that comes naturally to me if I have a purity of my mind and intellect. Satvasan Sudhe Purity of heart as we had heard before these qualities are obviously linked to each other. One cannot be developed without others being developed. Without the purity of heart the fearlessness does not come. If I don't have purity of heart I'll be always fearful of others. They will take advantage of me.\n\nPeople are going to walk over me if I don't behave this way. They will misunderstand me. All this fear actually my own inbuilt fear of how incomplete I am. More I know I'm incomplete. More fearful I would be more fearful I would be, more arrogant I will become. Therefore we see that the people who have achieved a lot they become more and more humble.\n\nOne of my friend had an encounter with Amitabh Bachchan. A whole group of actors were stranded on New Jersey airport. Amitabh Bachchan was one of them and he was telling me now this is obviously what I heard from him. He said Aloluptvam these guys are jumping up and down why we are. He said Bachchan was peacefully sitting on one side. They were saying well put me in a five star hotel and Aloluptvam that.\n\nBachchan ended up in my friend's motel in a comfort suite. And he said he was so happy and peaceful.",

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 16, Daiva Asura Sampada Vibhaga Yoga Divisions of Divine and Devilish Estates we are all hung up on estate these days because the republican wants the highest value of the estate you can pass on to your children without any taxes. That's because we consider this estate is something which I have acquired and accumulated. Something which is rightfully I have acquired, that becomes mine and everything associated with it. I consider it to be my estate. Now this my estate I want to preserve because I want to pass it on to my children even after I die. Therefore, I don't want the Texas government to take away.\n\nBabad Gita said that this the only estate you will take away is the quality of your mind and intellect. We have seen in previous chapters and in Vedanta in general that the death is only for the body. The mind and intellect remain intact, identifying as an individuality by its own conditioning. The only goal in life, scriptures tell us, is to unconditioned myself from this conditioning so that Mama Atma myself, which I consider me is without any conditioning, becomes the paramatma, the supreme self. The only difference between myself and supreme self right now is myself is conditioned by this conditioning. The limitations on me, my body, my mind, my intellect, the body I know has its own limitations.\n\nIt was born at a time T1, die at time T2. That I consider my death. What I do not know about is the nature of my mind and intellect. When it was born, when will it die? Our scriptures tell us that the death of the body is not the death for the mind and intellect and therefore to uncondition. This mind and intellect is the goal of my life.\n\nTherefore in the scriptures it says the only responsibility a seeker has is to purify his antahakara. This Antakaran Shuddhi is the goal of all the practices, all the learnings that we have. So this Antah Karan is my mind and intellect. The nature of my mind and intellect will decide what kind of wealth I have accumulated over my Existence as this mind and intellectual and this wealth is nothing but my experiences and my tendencies. So that the experiences are good and I have developed the good qualities. My experience was bad and I developed bad qualities that became my estate.\n\nSo the nature of this estate is now defined into two categories. That which brings me closer to my supreme self, the Paramatma. The qualities which takes me closer to my unconditioned self are called divine estate. The qualities which will bind me to this world. These limitations and therefore the sorrows and unhappiness associated with limitations are considered devilish estates. Divine is something which is beyond my conditioning.\n\nDevilish is something which is tying to my conditioning. So this chapter defines those two estates which I have. And all of us have some divine and some devilish estates. You know, just like viz. How about your portfolio? There are some good stocks in my portfolio.\n\nBut then there are some really, really bad ones. Same way my mind and intellect has some divine tendencies and some devilish tendencies. But therefore we have heard that the Mahabharata war is a war in my mind and intellect. Few good thoughts are fighting too many bad thoughts, but few good thoughts. If they are aligned with the self, the Paramatma, the Sri Krishna, then the war will be won between these good and bad tendencies in my heart. Now what can I do proactively is to introspect regularly and constantly and see what is the nature of my mind and intellect.\n\nAm I more on a divine side or am I on the devilish side? Am I gathering more divine qualities or am I gathering more devilish qualities? I will be only able to do that if I understand what is divine and what is devilish. Now it has nothing to do obviously with Hinduism or any particular scripture or any particular faith. These divine qualities are universal qualities no matter which faith I belong to or which scripture I study. Because this divine quality is Thou shall not kill non injury, compassion.\n\nAll that we have learned is nothing which I need to be taught. That something comes to me naturally. Even when a human being, a cave people, they knew that something which I have gathered with my efforts, nobody should take away from me. And therefore a good person will not do the same to the others. If I don't want somebody to take away from my efforts, I also shouldn't be taking away from somebody's efforts. So that became one virtue for a good person.\n\nThen there are all the others which I don't want others to do to me. I don't want somebody to hurt me. I don't want somebody to kill Me, I don't want somebody to cheat me. So now my good virtues are. I will not cheat anybody. I will not kill anybody.\n\nI will not hurt anybody. One of the criteria of a good seeker is defined in Vedanta as Just as. Even in my sleep I can never think about hurting myself. Even when I am completely deluded, I can't think about hurting myself. A true seeker, even while in his conscious state. Will never think about hurting anybody else.\n\nSo the good virtues are nothing which is so sacred to us. Good virtues are universal. Accepted by all cultures, all faiths and people of all caliber of intellectual levels. But we need to remind ourselves time and again so that we can introspect. So the first three verses which we had seen in chapter 16. Define those 26 virtues which are divine.\n\nIn other words, if I develop those 26 in my internal instrument, mind and intellectual. I will get closer to my supreme self. My mind and intellect's true nature is pristine. That it has an ability to see the reality as is. It is what I have acquired and superimposed on it as my estates have clouded that ability. Therefore, we consider the little children are divine.\n\nLittle children are the reflection of God. Because they see reality as is. They don't really have biases. I never had a chance to see a little baby growing. Because as I told you, I have only one son for up to three years. I didn't even know how he's growing up with my in laws.\n\nBut now my granddaughter has given me a chance to see that how a little baby grows from time of her birth to where she is right now, 15 months old. And I could say that gradually she's developing personality. She's developing likes and dislikes. Things which she consider is good for her and things not good for her. Previous to this, her stage is 15 months. She was completely oblivious about.\n\nShe knows what is good and what is bad and that's about it. So our mind and intellect, its very nature, is pristine. That it can see through the reality as is. But this coloring of my likes and dislikes which I have acquired. Has created this veil or this tint on it. So now I'm seeing this world through my tinted glass.\n\nSo which tint is good and which tint is not good is. Now we had been discussing. So the first 26 virtues which we have seen are the universal virtues which once developed will purify the mind and intellect. Bring it to its own pristine nature. So I can see the reality of myself as is. I start seeing that this Self is nothing.\n\nBut the Paramatma is the supreme self, just conditioned by my own limitations. Then the next three verses talks about which qualities which are really binding me to these limitations. So the verse four says Dhambah, Darpah, Abhimanaha, Chakrodah, Parushyam. You assume the good virtues. Now what are the vices? What are the bad qualities I can develop by my likes and dislikes which can be harmful?\n\nFirst is Dhambha hypocrisy to some respect. If you really introspect, we all do some kind of a Dhamba, something which I am not. I am trying to show enhancing your resume, Neil, is absolutely necessary in this world. You have to say how great you are. You fake it till you make it. So when I came to this country, I obviously came from Africa and in somewhat of a trained by British system where an architect cannot write his name larger than 2 inches anywhere in the world.\n\nSo our sign boards cannot have the names more than 2 inches tall. You cannot market, you cannot go and advertise. People are supposed to come to me for design and I'm not supposed to go to them. So I was in Houston, I obviously did not have a job. And one of the person who had a contracting company, he was trying to help me. So he gave me a little project, tiny little project.\n\nHe said, but Neil, we need a building permit and you don't know the system here, so I'll come with you to the Houston City hall and help you out. So we were standing in a line for the building permit application, and just before me is a Hispanic lady who wanted to extend her house. She was asking this guy and said, but I want a building permit to add this bedroom to my house. And the guy said, do you have plans? No, I don't have plans. Do you have an architect?\n\nWell, you need to get the plans drawn so that we can give you a building permit. My friend standing next to me said, neil, tell her that you're an architect. Neil, tell her that you're an architect. You can draw that plan for her. And I tell her, but how can I do that? She doesn't know me unless somebody introduce her to me.\n\nI can go and tell her that I'm an architect, that's okay. And he'll just go and give you a card. I don't have a card, you know, and he got so mad at me. You're never going to make it in this country. He said, this country, you need to walk as if you're the only architect ever walked on this earth there is nobody as great as you are. That was my first lesson in American marketing.\n\nNow we would consider a Dhamba. I know in my heart there are a lot of good architects. Much better than I am. At least I know where I am. But if I make that as my obsession to show the people it becomes a negative quality. First devilish quality.\n\nIs Dhambha showing something other than who I am. Nobody as good as I am. That's an arrogance which is obviously over estimation of my own capabilities or evaluation of myself. Then nobody can cheat me. And that's the guy who gets cheated very easily. I kept telling him this is not right for you.\n\nAnd he kept saying oh no, no. I've done so many businesses. I keep telling you you're going to get hurt on this project if you don't listen to me. He certainly was the easiest target to get hurt by others. Abhimanaha, these are the qualities even though I consider the helpful to me are actually most hurtful to me. Even when we are watching television or a movie only characters we like in them are one.\n\nWho are the nice guys? We don't like the villains. All the people who are very arrogant and pompous. So how can we like in real life if we are like that? How can we expect other people? And in the end, in all the movies and television who get hurt, those villains get hurt.",

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 16, Deva Asura Sampat Vibhag Yoga, Yoga of Divine and Devilish Estates. So as per some of the commentators, this chapter from 16 onwards, except 16, 17, 18 are elaboration on the ideas which are already discussed in Bhagavad Gita previously. But now we are elaborating on those ideas so that we can understand and apply in our daily life. So the idea which we have seen earlier in the Bhagavad Gita is that the soul is divine, your self is divine. But the imposition on the self by all the layers which you have acquired through interactions with the Prakriti is hiding that self from you. I can't recognize myself right now because of all the layering which we see on this pristine self.\n\nSo we have talked about who I the individual is. We talked about who the pristine self is. Now we are talking about what created this layering. So in chapter 15 we talked about the Supreme Purusha. The Purushottama is beyond perishable and imperishable. This body is perishable.\n\nThe self is imperishable. The equipment which I have to transact with this world, this body, this mind, this intellectual are perishable. But the one who is supporting this equipment using this equipment is imperishable. Then Bhagawan said that I am even higher than them both the conditioned self in me which I consider my soul, my self is imperishable and perishable self that I condition myself, my body, my intellect are the two perishable me and imperishable me. Beyond this is the Supreme Me which transcends both Me the perishable and Me the imperishable. Those are the ideas we have seen in chapter 15.\n\nAnd then in chapter 15 we also learned how that all pervading, imperishable became an individual soul. It's a portion of mine which is as eternal as my real self. When associated with this world of Prakriti then acquires five senses in mind then it enjoys the world of objects through those five senses and then gathering those experiences it creates its own personality. Now while interacting with this Prakriti I again both experiences. Experiences we are conducive experiences which are non conducive tendencies which I acquire becomes my wealth. So when we say my wealth in our day to day life is all that I earned and acquired.\n\nNow that has become my estate, it's my portfolio. So this chapter says I as the individual going through the variety of experiences from the day my soul started as an individual till today has acquired lots of impressions and built its own personality which has become my wealth, my estate. That estate has divine qualities but also some devilish qualities. And as these verses now will describe, what are the differences between the two? So the chapter opens with the first three verses which defines all the divine qualities or 26 qualities we have seen in first three verses. These are similar to the verses we have seen before where the Kshetra Gna was described by 20 qualities.\n\nKshetra was defined very elaborately in that chapter where Kshatragna was just given the qualities Amanittam oddam bitvam ahinsaakshantihi arjavam acharya upasana. Because the divine can only be expressed through its own expressions. Outside my physical appearance can be described by my mind, can only be read through my actions. Expressions of my mind, through my speech, my actions. So the divine is defined only by its expressions. And expressions we have seen in Kshatragna the Amani tum vadu.\n\nTheir similar qualities are here now described as divine qualities of a being, a person. The my estate then rest of the chapter now focuses on the devilish qualities or demoniac qualities. The reason for that is for us to know that the unique thing about ourselves is it's very easy for me to detect divine qualities in me. Also it is very easy for me to detect the devilish qualities in others. My devilish qualities I'm completely not aware of or even aware of. I have justification for it.\n\nBut my divine qualities I'm very aware of and I can detect very easily. Well, I'm a very honest person. I'm a straightforward person. All that I others see me other way around. So you ask Meena, my opinion about myself is very different than my opinion about myself. We constantly see the demonic qualities in other but divine qualities in us.\n\nOn the other hand, when I have to judge myself am I a divine being or demonic being? I'll always say maybe I'm not sure I'm not divine. So we are completely confused about whatever real nature is all about. So now Bhagavan clearly defines these qualities. Divine as we said is very easy to identify. But demonic are difficult when it comes to me.\n\nIt's very easy for me to say that's not a good quality in others. But the same behavior when I do, I will have a justification for it. So Bhagawan now goes in elaboration of why this quality should be detected within yourself and how to detect them and then avoid them. So verse 5 onwards, verse 4 gave us any brief the devilish qualities he said. Dhambaha Darpaha Abhimanaha Chak Krodha Parushyam Evacha Agnanam Cha ABHI Jata Seya Parta Sampadam Aswarim. This quality is born out of your asuric Sampathi Sampathy.\n\nWell you have acquired you that's not your real nature. This Sampathy is not your real nature. So as most of us at my age say we came from India with $8 in our pocket. Everything I have here is I acquired from United States in a working here. So we were born with pristine nature, the self without any quality. And we acquired all these qualities of what?\n\nSo Dhamba hypocrisy, Darpa arrogance. Now there are little differences between the way even though we feel they all basically fall into the same behavior pattern. But Dhamba hypocrisy something which I am not but I'm projecting. I'm not a very religious person but outwardly I try to come across as a religious person. Dhamba Darpaha arrogance I don't care. Abhimana Self conceit, greater opinion about oneself.\n\nAbhimanaha Krodha anger then Parushyam harshness, Physical harshness or mental harshness or Parasham harshness. Agnanam so ignorance Bhagavan says mourn out of your devilish qualities. More I associate with this world of materialistic Prakriti. More I lose my identity with my true self. Agnanam they are Abhijyata sya Partha Sampada Mahas. They are born out of your dual estate.\n\nThe qualities which you acquire from this world by attaching yourself to the materialistic values. So in simple obviously it is defined as divine qualities are one which are spiritual and devilish quality ones which are materialistic. So Swamiji explained that the whole humankind can be divided into two those who are more divine and those who are more demonic. And then he also goes into the third kind called Raksasis. Now obviously Sid is here so you have to be careful in defining this in historical terms. But Asuras and Raxasas were probably tribes at one point of time or Asura is actually one of the gods.\n\nThen there was a split. So people who are following Asura went to Iran and those who follow remain here. But as far as the ideas here that there are people who have more divine qualities or predominant sattvic qualities who are closer to their real self, those are more materialistic tendencies who are giving more emphasis to enjoying the material pleasures. They are called Asuras and Rakshasas are considered. Those are completely ignorant about either or. They are at the animalistic level where they are left on the lap of Mother Nature.\n\nThey don't have self efforts to improve themselves. So Bhagawan said here that these are the qualities which are considered demonic. Dhamba, Darpa, Abhimana, Krodha, Parushyam and Agnanam. And then rest of the chapter elaborates on the behavior and the verse 5 says Devi Sampadvi Mokshaya. Why should I be focusing on the divine? Because it will liberate you from your bondage.\n\nBondage with the identification with your limited self. Right now I consider myself to be the limited being. The limitedness is creating all the sorrows in my life. I'm not powerful enough, I'm not tall enough, I'm not strong enough. All those things which is stopping me to enjoy the unbroken happiness is because of my bondage to this limitedness. Once it is Devi Sampath Vimokshaya is for liberating you from your bondage.\n\nNibandhaya Asuri Mata Asuri is considered to be binding you to this limitedness. Masuchaha Sampadam daibim Abhijato Asi Bandava. But O Pandav, you don't worry, O Arjuna, don't worry. You are born with divine qualities. And last time we had discussion about whether Bhagavan said that because you are a royal prince. It does not say anything about royal prince here.\n\nIt simply says you are born with divine qualities. Bhagavan just assured him that just the behavior you have exhibited in your life. I assure you that you are born in divine qualities. As Swamiji says that we all can be assured that we have divine qualities. The very fact that on a Sunday morning you are learning Bhagavad Gita because of the divine quality. Giving assurance to seekers that if you are sincere about Liberating yourself, you need to have some courage.\n\nAs I said, we have easy detection of a divine quality. But when it comes to our judgment, we are not sure whether we are divine or not. So here is an assurance that because you are exhibiting divine qualities that you are divine. So the Master Chaha, do not worry. I look back on my life and I see a lot of mistakes I made and now I am worried about whether this is my exhibition of my devilish qualities. The very fact that you're interested in liberating yourself tells you that you are exhibiting the divine quality.\n\nContinue in a path of your journey for seeking your liberation. Now start making statements. Dvav Bhuta Sargo Loki Asmin Deva Asura Evacha Devo Vistarasahaprakhtaha Asuram Partha Meshrunaho. There are two types of beings in this world, Divine and demonic. Divine we have talked about at length in the previous chapters in Bhagavad Gita we have been talking about these divine qualities of the Supreme Being manifesting through all beings. We have been describing in detail.\n\nBhagawan said, so now I'll just focus on Asuri. I'm going to tell you Asuri in detail now. So rest of the chapter now focus on the behavior of Asuri. Prakriti Pravritimcha Nivruttimcha Janana Vidhu Asuraha. Very first manifestation of demonic qualities. I do not know what should be done and what should not be done, what is the right thing to do, what is not right thing to do, what I should be engaging into and what I should refrain from, what I should stay away from if I can decide that Bhagavan said, this is the first quality of your demonic estate.\n\nNo Saucam, there is no purity. Purity at the physical level, mental level, intellectual. Now Socham na cha API acharaha na satyam tesu vidyate. Those people with demonic qualities, they do not know what to do, what not to do. They neither have purity nor right conduct. They do not know the truth.\n\nAll these things are the manifestation of of demonic qualities. So now we can start looking at and say is that something I should be detecting in myself and correcting it? And with that I'll stop here because rest is continuing of this discussion. Discussing chapter 16 Deva Asura Sampath Vibhag Yoga Yoga of Divine and Devilish Qualities or estate Wealth. So we have started learning Bhagavad Gita from Lord Krishna where he first gave us this scenario of Arjuna. That Arjuna is a broken down hero, the person who has all the strength, all the valor, all the training to fight his situations.",

      "commentary": "Discussing chapter 16 Deva Asura Sampath Vibhag Yoga Yoga of Divine and Devilish Qualities or estate Wealth. So we have started learning Bhagavad Gita from Lord Krishna where he first gave us this scenario of Arjuna. That Arjuna is a broken down hero, the person who has all the strength, all the valor, all the training to fight his situations. But under the burden of the circumstances, he broke down and did not know what to do and what not to do. So Bhagavan told him that the only cure for your condition is to correct your understanding about what is right and what is wrong, what is permanent, what is impermanent. Since second chapter it clearly says that your mistake is that you are identifying with your limited self and looking at all the other people through their limited equipment.\n\nBut they are imperishable when it comes to the soul. Their real being is imperishable, just as yours. So that was the correction Bhagavan wanted Arjuna to make the identification from this limited to unlimited. In Bhagavad Gita, the journey is to change your identification from this limited being that I am to the unlimited soul that myself is. So everything we have discussed so far in Bhagavad Gita is towards that goal. Towards that goal of changing my identification with the limited self to unlimited self.\n\nSo entire Bhagavad Gita up to chapter 15 has described that unlimited self and how to identify with that. And in chapter 16 now we are discussing what is that which is binding me to their limited self. So as we have discussed, the first three verses told us about the qualities of the divine being or the divine estate. As we transact in this world, we are going to acquire wealth, we also accumulate other wealth. Respect, recognition, appreciation, and on the other side, disgust, criticism, all that also we accumulate along with accumulating the wealth which is generally our normal endeavor in life. So these become our estate.\n\nSome are divine and some are devilish. Something which are acquired is pure and something we are called impure. So Bhagavan gave us the first 26 qualities of the divine estate. And then in the fourth verse he gave another six qualities of the devilish estate. So he said, the divine is quite obvious. Most of us recognize divinity when we see it.\n\nAnd as we have discussed last time, it is easier for us to find divinity in us. For my mind to detect good quality in me is easy, very difficult for my mind to detect the negative tendencies in me, but it is very easy for my mind to see negative tendencies in others. That person is very hypocritical. Well, he is doing it for ego only. We can very clearly recognize it, but it is very difficult for us to recognize in ourselves. So this chapter takes upon itself to describe in detail what would be the behavior of a person who is predominated by negative tendencies, which in this case we call asuric tendencies.\n\nSo when we see this behavior in others, it is easier to detect. But when I do something similar, I consider that as well very, very minor or well, this is the way the life works. If I don't do it, then people will trample over me, I'll be a doormat. So my behavior I can justify saying that's how you survive in this world. But Bhagavan makes it very clear that if you detect this type of behavior, this behavior is very negative for your evolution, for your goal of liberation. So he said there are two types of one helps you to liberate yourself from the limitation.\n\nOther will be binding you to this limitation. More you try to satisfy your desires to get happiness through the material goals. You will be more binding yourself to this limitations. Pravruttim nivruttim cha janana vidhu asuraha. The first indication is that person does not know what to get engaged in and what to stay away from. I do not know what to do and what not to do, which is what the Arjuna situation was in the very first chapter.\n\nHe did not know what is right for him. Bhagawan is not saying the Arjuna is asura, but the behavior he exhibited was clearly of asuric tendency. So something in him which was not allowing him to decide what is right and what is wrong. But once I know that that's a negative tendency Pravrittimcha nivruttimcha janahanna vidhu asuraha those who have the predominant qualities, they will not know what to do, what not to do. Na saucam, na apiyacharah na satyam teshu vidyate they will not have purity, cleanliness also na satyam teshu vidyate. They will not be able to tell the truth.\n\nAnd Swamiji explains here that it is not to put them down that Bhagavan is saying this. It's actually somewhat of a pity for them that they're incapable of doing so. They're incapable of living an honest life, incapable of telling the truth. Because they're so afraid that telling truth will put them in trouble. In our daily life we call it white lie. Because you know, telling truth is going to put me in trouble.\n\nWell, you really don't want to say what you really think about. They will say generally around looks good. So that basically is my incapacity to tell the truth. These people, when look at overall life, they are just not capable of telling truth because of their desire to protect what they consider is giving them happiness. And then he continues. Asatyam a pratishtam te jagat ahuhu Anishwaram.\n\nThis statement relates to what we have learned so far in Bhagavad Gita. In Bhagavad Gita we have learned that the nature of the self is Sat chit in Ananda that Sat is ever existing. We also learned that Sat truth is something which is consistent in all three periods of time. In the past, in the present and future. Something which was true in past has to be true today and will also be true tomorrow. So that is considered Sathya.\n\nBut that which is not consistent, something which was true yesterday, which is not true today. At some point it was true. Everybody agreed with each other. Other will all fall down at the edge of the earth. But now we know that that's not true. So that was not true.\n\nNow what we know was true then even though we did not know it. It is true today and will remain true tomorrow. The people with asuric tendencies, they think that this world is asat. In a sense it is impermanent. It came in existence by chance and will perish. That means it's not permanent or pratish.\n\nIt just by chance occurring. It happened Te jagat ahuhu an ishwaram. And there is no controller. There is no central authority who govern the laws of nature. Their view is it all came about by an accident. Will remain in this situation for a while and will disappear.\n\nThere is no basis for this world to exist. There is no fundamental substratum which supports this universe. Universe came in Existence by accident will get destroyed by accident, basically. Or pratishtham te jagat ahu Anishwam. This is the worldview, Swami is a materialistic view. When I try to analyze the truth in this nature through pure physical science, only then obviously the only thing I can find is these two came together by some accident.\n\nThese elements came together by accident and then it happened this. Then other things happened by accident and then this happened this. So starting from the Big Bang, we can say Big Bang occurred. Why it occurred we don't know. But it's an accident. It occurred and after that it started expanding and then hydrogen became helium.\n\nAnd all this is just an accident without any basis. Anishwaram There is no controller who is controlling the laws of nature. Aparaha paraha sambhutam. By coming together two opposites. Kim annyat kaama haithu kam. So the progeny or the continuing of this life on this planet came out by just accident.\n\nBy coming two together and for the only purpose fulfilling desire. There was no master plan, there is no underlying truth, there is no substratum. But it just all chance occurring. This is the view of the materialistic atheistic people. They have no faith in any underlying reality for this world. Etam drastim avastabya nastaatmanaha alpa buddhayaha.\n\nObviously this is a direct criticism from the Gitacharya that these people are wrong. They are seeing this from a very narrow perspective because they are viewing this world from a very narrow perspective. So when I see my life as a living being and I just analyze from a chemical perspective, electrical perspective, this is just a pure machine. It came together and it is pumping blood through the pumping action. And I can define everything in a mechanical term, in a physical term, in a chemical term, and say this is me. But what is it that keeping all the systems together, I really don't have an answer.\n\nSimply saying it's just all working together. Physics came together, science came together. So basically you can see this life either as something divine which is supporting it, or simply say this is all just chance occurring. There is a book I have read called Brief History of Almost Everything. It's a fantastic book. It explains right from the Big Bang to where we are today in a very succinct manner.\n\nHis conclusion is that we as human beings existing on this planet is almost a chance. That one in a million odds that happen thing and it happened and continue happening and we are still existing. But anything could have gone wrong and we wouldn't have been here. So basically you're saying that maybe just a chance that we have become who we are. So here Bhagavan is saying that these people are looking at the world from a material perspective, analyzing what's happening from a material perspective. They're coming to the conclusion it's just chance occurring.\n\nWhy I am not tall enough and other guy 7ft tall is just a chance occurring. So Bhagavan said that having such view Nast Atmanah they are destroying their own self because they are negating their own self. They are not even recognizing that there is underlying reality. Called myself Alpa Buddhaya. They have intellect they are obviously analyzing. They are using all the faculties to understand this world.\n\nBut from a very narrow perspective. Alpam Buddha Fools it basically says very narrow perspective. Prabhavanti Ugrakarmanah Shayaya Jagato Ahitah. So the actions are very harsh because they are not recognizing the underlying unity of our things and being. You can take example of vegetarianism. The one underlying theme of vegetarianism is that every life has right to survive and live.\n\nSo you have to inflict as little harm to a life to support yourself. But if I don't have that view, then obviously killing other animals may be justified. So Bhagawan said that because they have a narrow perspective, their actions are harsh. Shaya Jagato Ahithaha because of the misunderstanding of how this universe work, they are the enemies of the world for its destruction. You can relate to our green movement about saving the planet. Now obviously there are a lot of people coming out saying all this thing is a hoax.\n\nWe really don't need to preserve anything. This planet will preserve itself. In fact, I just read that somebody written a book that actually the global warming will be very good for farming. There are more warmer weather and it will make people rich. So you can look at it from any perspective and your perspective will decide how you're going to act in this world.",

Awareness is the first step to transformation."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 16, Deva Asura Sampada Vibhaga Yoga, Yoga of divine and devilish qualities. And we have seen that these are the qualities of my mind. Even though it seems like it is describing two sets of different people, one are divine and one are devilish. And as if we are dividing this world again into divine and devilish. The purpose of these qualities to be described in Bhagavad Gita is to understand our own mind. Our own mind has this both qualities, the divine and devilish, depending on which one we promote, either we'll be liberated or will be bound more and more into this world of limitations.\n\nSo the last verse we had seen last time says Asa Pasas Satayi Baddhaha, the person who is not knowledgeable enough about what will liberate him and what will bind him by depending on this notion that the sense enjoyment is the only purpose of life. By hook or crook, I should achieve what I want. They will be more and more bound by unlimited desire, Asha Pasa, bound by this bondage of desires. You know, satay, that means innumerable desires. And therefore they will do anything which is either appropriate or inappropriate. They will try to achieve, acquire, hoard things which they think will give them the happiness by even illegal means.\n\nInappropriate means continuing in the same dialogue as we have seen, Bhagavan now describes what will be the tendency or the thinking of these people. Swamiji says there's not really much to elaborate on it. Just as we have seen that the first three verses which describe the divine quality, there is not really much to be discussed about. These are universal qualities. Even cavemen knew what is right and wrong. Somebody should not take the food which I have acquired with my labor.\n\nTherefore, if I do that to others, it will be wrong. I don't want somebody to kill me, and therefore killing somebody is bad. These are universal values which every human being from the dawn of the civilization know. Same way that what we are going to be discussing, the tendencies and thinking of a devilish mind Is also really doesn't require much explanation. You know why we all have experienced this at some point of time or other, at some level or other. Except that at that time I did not know that my thinking is going to create more unhappiness.\n\nWhen I was thinking about that I was thinking I'm doing this to get more happiness for financial security. I put more and more money into stock market and as it grows I get the statement every month and it says okay, it made 8% and next 10% feeling pretty good. Except when it collapsed. Didn't have courage to open up your statement. But while I was doing that I thought I'll get this and then I'll also get this and also get this and therefore I'll be completely secured. We didn't think we have to do this and we work all life so hard.\n\nI have not come across a single person who says I really need to work hard in my life but I'm enjoying it. Everybody thinks that what I was thinking all the time was Idam Adhya Maya Lavdham I have gained this today. Today, today I can say I have this. I reconcile my statement of what is my assets at the end of the year for taxes or whatever. Boy, that's pretty good. Or well at least I have this.\n\nAnd then what is my next thought? Imam Prapse Manoratham I have this but I will also get this. What if financial planner says okay well you need to have this and to retire at the age of such and such. Whatever this many times of your current income you will need this and therefore you need to do the following. So you start planning. First time a financial planner was a friend of ours coming to Chinmaya mission in Dallas.\n\nI was pretty young at the time. I was like 30 something. And he looked at them and said you need million something dollar to retire. I don't think I'll ever have a million dollar. At the time I was probably making like $35,000 a year and the guy was trying to tell me I need million dollar to retire. You forget about it, okay?\n\nI'm going to work till I die. No planning required. Because when you see that I have this, I need to achieve this or work hard. Neel, you have to have at least this much when you retire. I have this right now. This is a common thinking.\n\nNobody will label that as devilish. Bhagavan says that's the quality which binds you to this world of constant changes and disappoints you more times than you think it will. Idham asti idam API me bhavishyati punardhanam. And this wealth shall also also be mine in future. It's planning simple. I acquired this and I'll work a little hard and do this project and then invest here and then I'll get this.\n\nBhagavan said, but that may be okay for planning purposes, but when that becomes your obsession, then it has a sure capacity to failure. You should be planning. I can never forget this thing in my life. I bought my first house in Dallas, Texas in 1984, just before the election. I guess it was the Reagan second election. And they told me that after the election the prices will go so out of control that you won't be able to buy.\n\nSo you should buy before the election. Says, okay, you buy this house, $150,000 minimum, it will have 5% appreciation. You have compounded 5% for 10 years. The value of this thing will be this. Oh boy, that's pretty good. They say that's guaranteed 3 to 5%.\n\nIt may go up and it's guaranteed. I sold that house, the one which I bought in 1984, in 2000. Now you apply that formula, 150,000. Should have been at least $350,000, right? I sold it for $10,000 more than what I bought in 1984. And as if I have not learned the lesson yet, I bought a house in Northern Virginia where they say it was Dallas.\n\nYou know, that's an oil dependent economy. It goes down or it goes up. We are federal government dependent economy. Guaranteed 20% appreciation every year. You can look at it last five years and you will see it. I bought a house again in 1988, Northern Virginia, in Fairfax.\n\nAnd again I said, well, they say 20%. I'm going to be on 5%. Okay, at least I'm safe. I projected in about 10 years, eight years, five years. I bought it in 1988, sold it in 1996 for exactly $6,000 more than what I had bought for. I made $6,000 after eight years owning that house in Fairfax, Virginia.\n\nWe plan, but what will come out of my actions is not guaranteed. Bhagavan said, there's nothing wrong in planning. That's not in a devilish pursuit. What devilish pursuit is, if this doesn't happen by hook or crook, I will make somebody a Scapegoat and get my money. So therefore it says Idamasti Idham Apimi Bhavishati Punardhanam. This is mine and this will also be mine.\n\nThat which I have projected at a 5% appreciation that shall also be mine in 10 years. I can say this is what I have. This is its value today. What will happen 10 years from now only he knows. And whoever after 10 years has to buy this house knows. So it is the attitude of my mind makes the same thing either divine or devilish.\n\nI took care of this competition. Obviously in those days they were enemies and they were killing each other. But in a normal day to day even they say I never have killed anybody. So I never said I killed this person. But we do mentally all the time. I killed this competition.\n\nHe was trying to be the VP of the company. But I really manipulated. I went around and talked to all the other bosses and I really pushed him down. And now I got the promotion as vp. That's I who killed him for that purpose. So Asaomaya Hataha Satrahu who was my enemy who is in the path of my happiness.\n\nMy enemy is the one who is obstructing me to be united with my happiness. I killed this person, initiator Aparanape and the others who I think will be on my way, I will kill them too. It always gives me a kick. Anytime I read this Rasi Bhavishya we get this South Carolina Sati magazine and only thing I read is honestly the horoscope. Because I have nothing to do with all these businesses in South Carolina. Only thing I can relate to is that last page which says your monthly horoscope.\n\nAnd this guy constantly warns me. At least the Aries who I am, you know, born in that sign. Be careful about the people around you. They may be planning to harm you. Now what do you think? My thinking would be well look at Meena, Pourvi, Neeraj, little Medha.\n\nThey must be all planning something against me or my employees or my friends. This is just insecurity. We bank on people's insecurities. Because if you don't take these annuities the market may go down. You will have no security when you are retiring. You need a guaranteed income.\n\nAnnuities will give you this guaranteed income. He fails to tell you that those annuities cost lot more than any other investment you would do. They are making money in your insecurities. What will happen when I return If I don't have money they say okay we'll take care of it. But we'll take part of your money and put it in our pocket and make you feel good that you will have the guaranteed income. I took care of this computation, this enemy, even the others I'll take care of them too.\n\nTherefore I will be secured. When I'm doing this, my state of my mind is I am the Lord of my being. I take care of myself. Not only I take care of myself, I take care of all people around me. What would happen to them had I not been doing what I am doing. All these people are dependent on me.\n\nBhogihi and I'm enjoying it. All these efforts which I'm putting and gaining this I have got that I'll be getting. I'm the Lord of lord is on whom my existence is dependent on. So in the feudal system whether you live or die, the way you live is dependent on the Lord. He decides how much money there was no unions and nobody decides how much to give it to the workers. He decides whatever he has to give.\n\nSo therefore he's the Lord and you're the commoner. Ishwara Same he decides how this world is going to function. So when I decide that I am the Lord of my Sansar I decide in old Indian system the head of the house will tell how everyone should leave in that house. I think that I control everybody and everything. Bhogi and I'm enjoying the fruits of my actions. I'm a successful one.\n\nWhat you have accomplished in your profession and it's admirable and what you accomplished in your wealth and it's all admirable. Guy doesn't know the other side of the story. What I not accomplished and where I have failed. It is okay for others to think about that. When I start thinking about my own accomplishments that's where the problem starts. It's perfectly okay for us to admire the people who accomplished some great things such as Isaac Newton or Bill Gates or Steve Jobs.",

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 16, the Evasura Sampada Vibhaga Yoga. The divine and devilish qualities are the estates. This is the only estate you and I will carry with us when we die. All other estates will remain. But these qualities or tendencies of my mind, which are both as some divine tendencies and some devilish tendencies, I will carry that as my estates and I'll start from there. You've seen so far that this divine tendencies will liberate me from my limitations.\n\nThe veilings on my mind which is right now is not letting me see the reality as is that myself and the supreme self is one and the same. On the other hand, the devilish qualities or the aspheric tendencies which in reality all it means is it binds me to this manifest world and therefore I will be more covered with ignorance from my own self. And therefore it is very important for me to understand what are these qualities. So in the beginning we have learnt about all the divine qualities and they are universal as we have said. So therefore there is not really much explanation needed. I should treat others just as I would like others to treat me.\n\nSuch divine qualities in if I practice it will liberate me from my limitations. But more and more I get bound to this world of manifestation. This is me and this is the world. This I want and this I want to avoid. It binds me more and more to this world. And therefore it is very important to understand how this thing works.\n\nSo we have seen so far that asuric tendencies make people believe that there is nothing more to this world than enjoy the sense gratification or satisfying the desires that I have, the lust that I have, and who knows, because I cannot see what was before my birth and I cannot see what was after my birth. Well, let's just consider this life is the only life that I have. And therefore let's make the most out of this life by by hook or crook. So I have now come to the conclusion that hoarding more and more wealth will make me happy. I will achieve that by any means, any unjust means. Even though I know this is not right, I will go ahead and do it anyway.\n\nAnd once I get into that mode of mind, my situation would be that I will be constantly worried. Chintama Aparimayamcha AP I'll be overwhelmed by the worries. I'm always worried about things which I don't have. Once I acquire it, I'll be always worried about how to safeguard it. Because just as I took it away from somebody, somebody will take it away from me. So this mode of mind will be constantly be engulfed by these worries.\n\nBut then at the same token my ego will start rising into its power and start thinking look, I have acquired this. These are the natural tendencies of my ego. Once I accomplish something, I start thinking nobody else could have done but I did it. So then last few verses which you have seen is the mode of my mind. Even success is something is very difficult to digest or to become worthy of it. Because success can intoxicate you with wrong thoughts.\n\nInstead of getting you to the higher level by whatever you learned or whatever you achieved it sometimes bring you down. And if you fall into that category, what happens is what we have seen in last few verses which basically says Adyaha Abhijan Vanasme I am rich. Once I have acquired the wealth because I thought that's my security that will give me happiness. I now forget that why I acquire this wealth. But it starts giving my ego a boost and say look I am rich. So now I'm associating myself with my riches.\n\nI start thinking I am my car, my car is me. I expand my identity not just to me as the body, mind and intellect but now all the possessions that I have. So my identity is incomplete without my possessions. Me minus my possessions is nothing. Now therefore I think I am rich. Abhijaan Vanasmi I am well born and Konyo Asthisudrusomaya who is there, who is like me.\n\nThese are the side effects of success. Success is something obviously very necessary for you to do what you need to do. But if that success only associate with why I wanted to achieve this then it's not really that big of a problem. But when I start associating with my ego then all these side effects will kick in. So now what I'm doing, even the thing which I'm doing good instead of giving me good results give me actually wrong results. So Yakshe Dashyami Modishya I am making the sacrifice.\n\nSacrifice is something you make so that you become more humble. But now I'm making sacrifice which makes me more arrogant. That look I am making sacrifice. Other people are not doing it. I am giving this donation. Donation is something is for you to get rid of more of your ego.\n\nBut it actually gives you boost your ego more that I am making donation. So the things which are supposed to be giving you the right results now start giving you the wrong results. Bhagavan said that this Asurik Sampath is. You need to be very careful in understanding that what are its evil effect on your mind and yourself. Once you are deluded. They get these wrong results even from the right actions.\n\nAnek Chitta Vibranta Mohajal Samavrataha. Why all these things happening to them? Because they are Anek Chitta Vibhranta. They are bewildered by many fancy. They have all different kinds of fancies about what they are going to achieve, what their capabilities are. And I can also do that.\n\nI tell all the time that if you are in one profession you always like to start thinking that something associated with it also I can do it. Most architects start getting into development and investment and real estate and all that. Because everybody comes to ask me how to do this. Why don't I do myself and also make money? In the end every architect who has tried has failed. Because that's not your really expertise or nature.\n\nYou're good at something. That's why you became something. But this fancy of mine which says I can do this, I can also do this. I have achieved this. I can also accomplish this. Moha jala sama brutah.\n\nBecause they are entangled into the snare of Moha delusion. This moha is simply my mind just cannot see the value of things and being as they are. So I start associating more and more values where they don't belong. Including on my own self, my own abilities. So I'm completely entangled into it. Prasaktaha kama Bhageso.\n\nWe know how the addiction works. Once I get something, I want to get it again and again. My Starbucks example, first time I had the Starbucks coffee. It's not an addiction. The second time and a third time and after that, how can you live without it? Prasaktaha kama Bhagesha.\n\nOnce I start enjoying the sense gratification more and more I get addicted to it. Patanti Naraki Ashucha. These unclean minds, people with the unclean intentions, they fall into the Naraka hell. When things don't go right for us and we start worrying about it and start losing sleep over that. It's falling into hell. Other people may think you are doing very well but you ask yourself how you are doing.\n\nAre you enjoying Neil? Because 18 things are going right in my life. But these two are not letting me enjoy those 18 things which are going right for me. So where me living not in heaven but in hell. From outsider's perspective, I may be doing very well. Therefore you read these stories about people in the hedge fund manager.\n\nThere'd be billions, not even millions and still they are suffering through. He is under investigation, going to jail. If money was the only object which was going to make him happy, he wouldn't be living in this situation. Patanti Naraki Asuchao with that unclean intentions, pursuing the goals of satisfying their desires instead of giving them joy which they were seeking from those endeavors, they fall into this hell. Atma Sambhavitah Stabdaha. Now other people can see, but I think he's doing wrong.\n\nHe's going to get hurt by this thing. But I don't see myself. I'm suffering but I'm still continuing. In Gujarat there is a saying, a gambler who is losing, he puts double the stake. He thinks the next time I can make it up. And this is really true.\n\nStock market, forget about gambling. Stock market people put money, the stocks go down. He think, oh now this is the time to get in. He puts more money into it. There was a company I was designing a headquarter in Charlottesville called Value America. I don't know any of you remember, but 2000, it was a rising company.\n\nInternet bubble at the peak. And they hired me to design their headquarter in like June or July. And they had 600 people. And then they told me that by December we had thousand people. So they were designed with 1000 people. This building has to be completed by end of next year or so.\n\nWe are rushing to do that. And then just before the end of the year in December, I get a call and say, Neil, send your invoice as quickly as possible because tomorrow the company may not be there. So anyway, the company was in a stock market. And then by the time I got involved, 15. And then when they called me it was about like $4 and say, got to be this good. No matter how much $4 will at least put $4,000.\n\nI put thousand shares at $4, I said, I have seen that all the setup and those computers and all that is more than what they are saying. Well, the $4, then it eventually became 20 cents and eventually become zero. Even though I knew things are going down, I thought there's got to be a better deal. That's because we're atma Sambhavidah. We're overconfident about our own ability to think what reality is. Atma sambhavitah tab dhaha stubborn.\n\nEverybody else says, I understand this thing better than you. Sabdaha dhanamanam adhan vitaha. Filled with pride and intoxication by their own achievement. No matter what the other people see what I'm doing, which is dangerous, I don't say it myself. Yajante nama yagnehi te dambena Avidhi purvakam. I want to do right things.\n\nI have done this thing because I think this will help me doing right thing. But I got completely distracted by my ego. It has affected my Ahankar so much that now when I am doing the right thing, as I said the sacrifice, I'm doing it just in the name of it. It's not truly a sacrifice anymore. And I'm doing everything else. Giving a donation, showing off what I'm doing right for the community, services, all that.\n\nI'm doing it for the namesake only. If you don't put my name in this, I'm not interested. I will be making donation as long as you make me board member. So my now thinking has gone completely in a wrong direction. I understood before when I didn't have all this wealth that all these yajnas and daan and what I have to sacrifice and services is for my own good. To purify my own self.\n\nBut with all this achievement of my wealth, I have started thinking other way around. And therefore now I'm doing all the things avidhi purvakam not in a right manner.",

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 16, Deva Asurasampatvibhaga yoga. Yoga of Differentiation between the divine and Devilish Estates. These are the two types of qualities we have acquired in this world, going through the various experiences throughout our life. And when we look at it from our perspective, for many lives, we've been going through many different experiences. These experiences leave impressions on my mind. Those impressions create tendencies.\n\nThose tendencies which I have is my wealth. That's all I carry around from one life to another. All other wealth which I consider my wealth right now is temporary and I have to leave behind. But this wealth which my tendencies I carry with me. So that's my permanent wealth, my permanent portfolio. So Bhagavan said that in that portfolio you may have divine qualities or divine tendencies and also devilish tendencies.\n\nNext, positive tendencies and negative tendencies. Positive, as we always know, is helpful. Negative, as we always know, is harmful. So these divine tendencies which I have are liberating. Bhagawan said in the beginning of the chapter, these are liberating tendencies. These tendencies will lead me to act in a manner which will liberate me from my limitations.\n\nLimitations are the ones which are binding me to sorrows and unhappiness. If I'm powerful to own every piece of real estate in this town, then obviously I won't be competing for buying house in Twin Hickory because I own everything, but because I am never infinite. And this limitedness creates computations and failures, so that creates sorrows and unhappiness. So we're going to say that these divine tendencies which you have acquired through your experiences, which align you more with your own self, are liberating from this bondage. Bondage of this identification with this body, mind and intellect, this limited self which I have right now considered to be my true self. On the other hand, the other tendency, the devilish tendency.\n\nNow in this case, even though the word devilish or diabolical sounds too negative, but they are basically tendencies born out of my ignorance. What is the truth about my own Self. So I come to the conclusion that there is no higher self. There is no one to control anything. Whatever I can do, I am by myself. Whatever I need, I need to do to get happiness.\n\nThat type of belief will lead me to do things which are only for the sense gratification. These creates the negative tendencies and binds me more and more to this limited self. Bhagawan said these tendencies are binding which are in our normal term. We call it a materialistic view of the world and materialistic approach to life. That this material will give me happiness. The things which I acquire from this world, things which I accomplish in this world will make me happy is the materialistic viewpoint.\n\nSpiritual viewpoint is if I can be happy by myself, then I really don't need anything to make me happy. Everything else may be just to fulfill my needs, but not wants. So desire to just sustain myself is not really unhealthy. But then when that desire become obsession for something and then it become unhealthy. As we know, everything in moderation is good. Even obsession to not do something can become very dangerous sometimes.\n\nSo Bhagavan described these tendencies and said that these are the tendencies you should avoid. These are tendencies you should try to cultivate in your. And then he came to the last topic when he initially said that we have talked about divine qualities a lot. We'll talk about these devilish qualities in detail. That's what we need to pay attention to. As I said in the beginning that our mind has a tendency to only see divine in us.\n\nDivine qualities in us. Devilish qualities in others. Very easy to see what other people are doing wrong. Very difficult to see what I am doing wrong. We always enhance our resumes. We ask somebody to do his own self evaluation in the end of the year.\n\nIf you see his self evaluation, there is no negative in it, period. His supervisor will find negatives in. Is very important that we develop discipline to introspect and find what is not right within my own thinking and negate them. Bhagwanti, these tendencies you must know these devilish tendencies. When you detect them in you. You say remove them so that you can move forward in your life.\n\nYour goal is to be happy. This tendency will never make you happy. Even though it seem apparently that will make me happy. It eventually makes you unhappy and therefore avoid them. So you have seen that Bhagawan described that what a ashuric person looks like. The Ahankaram Balam darpam Kao Kamam krudam chasam Sri Taha.\n\nThey are full with ego, power, self conceit, lust and anger. Now we all have all of that in some degree. But if all of them together are powerful then you become an Asura. Look, one thing, if you're all five of them in a full capacity then you become an Asura Bhavan, Mama Atma, Paradehesu, Pradvisanto, Abhishu, Yakaha. They hate my presence in them and in others. In other words, they have no value for life.\n\nThey will have no value of life, of their own or others. They will have no value for any noble act or have no desire or to appreciate other people. So they have no knowledge about what is divine in them or their own conscience. They will suppress their own conscience when it is trying to guide them for a right actions. And they will also not recognize the good intentions of others around them when others are trying to help them. These people will hate me in their own body and also in the others.\n\nTanaham, Drisatha, Kruran Sansareso, Naradhavan, Pami, Ajastram, Asuban. To these cruel doers, the lowest of low men. As I said, when you are qualified for this distinction, when all five of those qualities are fully developed in you, there is no room for any divine tendency. Then Bhagwanga, I send them to the lowest of the Yunus. And we have discussed last time you. It is not that Bhagavan is punishing.\n\nSo Bhagavan is not sitting there and punishing people. Because you are not doing this right, your own actions will lead you towards the lower and lower state of existence. Whatever the tendency you develop, that is the environment you will feel comfortable. My tendency is to come to Gita class. I will feel comfortable here and somebody may be comfortable doing something else. Because their tendencies.\n\nIf your tendency leads you down to this path of the Hankara, Balam, Darpam, Kamam Krudam, you will be born into the same environment again. If you consider this sense gratification is the only goal of life then obviously you will be only seeking that environment. And Bhagawan said, I, as the lawgiver and law enforcement forcer in this world put them into the lowest yoni again and again. Asurim Yonim Apanna Muda Janmani Janmani. Birth after birth, having born in the demonic wombs. Because that's the path I have chosen.\n\nWhatever path I take, I become good at that. So you start your career in engineering or architecture, medicine. You do the first project and the second project and in a short time you'll have a huge portfolio of work you do. And suddenly, whether you like it or not, you become an expert in that. And other people say, but you are only expert in this. We can give you work in this field because you only do this.\n\nThat's how we become all experts in something. Because we continue to do the same thing over and over again in the same line of work or same line of actions. So these people are now becoming expert in asuric existence. Ashram yuni mapanna by taking birth in Ashram yuni again and again. Mama aprapyevakantoya tatoyati Adhamam gatim. They continue their existing without attaining me, Attaining me.\n\nBy not recognizing their own self. They continue their existence from one life to another without recognizing what is divine in them, without recognizing the sanctity of life. And yantim adamam gatim. And they continue to go lower and lower and lower. Because that's the path they are pursuing, they are progressing into. Then he says, trivedam naraka sidham dwaram.\n\nSo up till now we have just discussed what are the divine qualities, what are the devilish qualities, what are who are divine, who are devilish. But what is the cause? So this verse gives us the cause and also prescription how to avoid them. Trivedam narakashya idam dwaram nasanam atmanah. These three are the gates of hell which are the destroyer of yourself. Kamah Krodhah Tathalova, Lust, anger and greed.\n\nThese are the only three things which you have to avoid, Bhagawan. Now knowing this, we fall prey to these three. Because how the karma works is once you start thinking about some object. When you constantly think about any object, you develop attachment to it. Then you create a desire for that. If you don't get that object, you're a krodha.\n\nSo you created attachment. That attachment became lust. Lust in a sense, I ought to have it. Without that, life is not worth living. So that becomes a kamaha. A normal desire to buy a car is not a kamah because I need it for transportation.\n\nBut it becomes obsessed and I have to have BMW and then BMW, BMW, BMW. Then it's a problem if I don't get it. Because I said I can buy BMW in $50,000. And then by the time I accumulate 50,000, the car has gone to 60,000 or 70,000. It almost is slightly above my pay grade. And that will make me angry.\n\nSo Bhagawan said, that's the mechanism of lust. A normal desire is Innocent. I'm thirsty, I need water. I have a desire to drink water. I'll get up, get a glass of water and I'm done with it. But a constant obsession about something becomes karma.\n\nWhen that obsession is obstructed by this world for me to attain that I become angry. So that Krodha, we all learned in chapter two the anger. It shuts down my buddhi. Because we have this safety mechanism just like the breaker trips and electricity that to protect integrity of your mind and intellect. The intellect will shut off so it doesn't overburden. So you have no access to your buddhi.\n\nYour memory bank is completely out of your reach. So you cannot access your wisdom when you're angry. Therefore people say, well I, I did it because I was angry. That means it's not appropriate. But I did it because I was angry. So all my actions within the state of anger are actually not really good for me.\n\nWe all know that Bhagawan said so avoid karma so you don't have to get angry with Crowther. That's the second gate of and now what happens is if I have a lust for something or karma for something and I achieve that object easily then become greedy. I have the one time I've got it done. I buy a lotto for the first time and I get a hundred dollar prize. Well, looks like this is an easy pass. So I do it again and again.\n\nMaybe I can win a jackpot. So that success actually became problem for me. Because I now crave to get that experience again and again and again. When I fail at that, I'll be angry again. So at the end of the day I was nothing but angry. If I get what I want, I still will be angry.\n\nAnd if I don't get what I want, I still will be angry. So I live in the hell all the time.",

So that's basically how the Bhagavad Gita started saying this is our problem, all our problem starts with that one misunderstanding that I am this limited being, this Mamakaha is my world, I and mine is my world. And then I separate the rest of the world as something other than me. Then the next few verses focuses on Duryodhana. That is the Duryodhana in us.\n\nThis Duryodhana represents the thief in us. That we want to take away something which belongs to somebody else. And I want to make it mine. Then I want it so badly that I will use any means to get it in. All over day to day life we see inequality in our society because obviously there is wealth which is common to all, given by God is natural. When somebody hoarded so much and didn't.\n\nLive enough for the others. So that the Duryodhina wants this thing so badly. He knows it's not his, but he wants it. And therefore he is always very anxious because he has decided I need to have it. I know it is not mine, but I need to have it for my own happiness, to make myself complete. This sense of incompleteness which started out.\n\nWith our state of Dhritarashtra where because. We are blind to our reality and then make ourselves limited to this self and that I and mine created incompleteness, that incompleteness has created a thief in us that I want to take away from others and make it mine so that I will feel complete. That's what Duryodhana felt all his life. That I need all this kingdom for myself. He was already Given half the kingdom. After the first match of chess and now he wants all of it.\n\nSo his mental state is of any thief who is trying to steal something away from somebody else, one is insecure. When you are trying to steal something, you are insecure. Is somebody watching me? So there is insecurity and then fear. Obviously you are fearful, you are insecure. That's why you want to make sure that I get what I want by any means.\n\nSo there are three things in that mentality. I want this so badly that I'll. Be willing to do anything. I'm insecure and I'm fearful. So the next few verses which we have seen is just describing his titi. First six verses we have seen said.\n\nLook at Pandava's army. It looks pretty well protected. Great warriors on their side basically is going to Drona and saying, these are all your Shishyas. Arjun, son of Drupada Drishtadharamna, who is. Now commandering the army. So I'm not sure that we are.\n\nTotally protected having somebody like Drona with us. Because his shishyas on the other side. That'S a fear in him. So he describes all that he feels is the weak points from looking at the other side. And now he realized that he may have gone overboard. When somebody is in that state, he wants to cover both bases.\n\nOne side he feels insecure. Other side he feels very powerful that. I have all the shrewdness and smartness and strength to do it. So first looked at his insecurity and his weaknesses that the other side is powerful. Now he's looking at, no, no, I can do it. Because so the verse 7 onwards, he now looks at his strength.\n\nAsmakamtu Visishtaye Tani Bauda Dwijottama. Obviously he's addressing to Drona. And he said Dvijottama. And we have discussed before Dwijottama Dwija Brahmin. Brahmin is considered twice born. One is a physical birth and second is a birth.\n\nIn this knowledge of who you are that starts at the time of Upanayam, Guru gives a mantra in his ear. Then he runs to the Gurukul to get that education. So he becomes established in this knowledge. That's why it's called Dwij. Because the first is just for a limited being, it's a physical birth. Second birth is where he takes birth as a wise person.\n\nSo therefore they are called Dwijaha Drona. Being A Brahmin is Dwijaha. But he said, Dwijot Tama, you are. Best among the Brahmins. Now this could have been the best. Compliment in a normal situation.\n\nBut in this situation it is not because we know or at least the society knew at the time. Brahmins are soft hearted. They are not fighting type. They are not war mongerers. They are not the ones who can be in the situation. They want to avoid this type of conflict.\n\nWe have seen that that's how Karna. Was caught by Parasuram. Karna, obviously he went to Parasuram because he realized other than Drona, Parasuram can. Teach him what the other Pandavas are having. Pursuram has taken vow. He will not teach any Kshatriya because.\n\nHe wanted to eliminate Kshatriyas from this planet. So he has taken a vow. He will not teach this art of warfare to any Kshatriya. So Karna goes there as a Dvija, as a Brahmin. He disguises himself as a Brahmin or. Lies that I am a Brahmin.\n\nAnd then obviously he was a good student. One day, teacher was sleeping and his head was in Karna's lap. And then this Brahmar, what do you call it? Okay, bumblebee that comes and sits on Karna's thigh. He realizes that if I move, my. And he does not want to make his Guru uncomfortable at all.\n\nHe's in a deep sleep. This bumblebee course through his flesh and the blood is oozing out of that wound. He tolerates all that pain but does not move a muscle. So that his Guru gets disturbed in his sleep. The blood comes running down his thigh. Under the Guru's head.\n\nAnd he wakes up because of the warm blood he feels. He wakes up and sees what's happening. Then he realizes what has happened. And Karnataka says, I'm fine. And he was angry because Guru said, you lied to me. You are not a Brahmin.\n\nIf Brahmin would not have been capable to tolerate this kind of pain. You are a Kshatriya who lied to me. And then obviously, as the story goes, he asked for forgiveness and all of that. But then Parsuram said, you will have. This knowledge but it will not come. Handy to you when you really need.\n\nIt in the battlefield. You will lose this knowledge. The relevance here is Dvija is not a positive compliment when you are in a war. So he reminds him that look, I know you are a great teacher and a great archer and great warrior. But in the end you are a. Dvija so don't be soft hearted here.\n\nIt's actually his fear that maybe this. Guy will go soft hearted and will. Not fight this battle. Sangartam tan bravi mi te. Therefore I am going to now describe to you who are the great warriors and oversight. Don't go soft hearted on me.\n\nWe have also great people on our side. You don't need to worry about it. You just do your job. Bhavan Bismast Chakranastha starting with you Bhavan, you who are on our side so that we feel that we are protected. Bhavan, you Bisma, Karna, Krupastha, Samitin, Jaya and Krupacharya who are victorious. All these people have good track record of resume of winning battle.\n\nAsvathama, Vikranscha, Somadatt, Tatha, Evacharya and then all others like Asvathrama. Last time we have seen Kurupacharya is Dronacharya's brother in law and Aswathrama is Dronacharya's son. So Swamiji says here or we can't have in one family all this bravery and valor. So he's obviously making it up a little more than what he should be. But whatever it is, these are all great warriors. Swathama was more like Duryodhana.\n\nHe was Duryodhan's best friend and he. Was basically looking for that. If he stays with Duryodhana and Duryodhan. Wins the war then he will have a kingdom of his own. Drona and Drupada were friends and they probably learned together at some Guru. Drona goes to Drupad and asking for some favor to make him a Raja somewhere and Drupad insults him.\n\nThat's where their animosity started. So the long story all weaved into it. But in the end basically Duryodhana said these are all people, the great people on our side and not only the main characters but Anyeche, Baha, Bahasuraha, Madharte, Tyakta, Jeevitaha and there are many others on our side who are ready to give up their life for me. Many, many brave people are on our side. In other words, they're committed to fight this war. Yudwijotama, I'm not sure about you but I'm sure about everybody else.\n\nThey are committed to fight. So let's do the right thing here. Nana Sastra Praharanaha, Sarve, Yuddha, Visharadaha. Not only they are ready to fight for me but they are equipped with various types of weapons. So we are well equipped. We have a human capital, we have technology.\n\nSo let's not worry about it. Yudda Visaradaha they are expert in warfare. This verse obviously confuses everybody because why. That Apar Yaptu insufficient. Now every translation I have seen does say insufficient Even though it seems that unlimited is more appropriate here. And I had asked Swamiji one time I said Swamiji, all this translation where does that come from?\n\nAnd Swamiji says we don't get involved in this because you need a Sanskrit pandit to translate this. And he says there are Sanskrit pandits and Kashi who is translated Bhagavad Gita. After all this discussion and looking at. It and that's the translation we use. So even the Chinmaim translation does not really come from Chinmaimita and Swamis it actually came from Pandits who have decided this is the translation of some. So we have to take it as it is and say Apar Yaptam in our vernacular languages.\n\nAa Pariyapta is insufficient. He's saying insufficient. Now remember his mentality is that of a thief. He always feels that he is incomplete. He always feels no matter how much. That person has he will always feel.\n\nThere is something more I should have. And therefore his vision about what we have is not ever we are sufficient. We have plenty then even be fighting this battle. So even army he sees that as insufficient for all these people who went on Pandava's side they actually should have been on my side then it would have been much better. And my army is protected by Bheeshma. Because he knew that Bheeshma has taken a vow that as long as he leaves he will guard the throne of Hastinapur.\n\nWhoever is in the Hastinapur he will be protecting him. He also knows that Bheesma has Ichamritya. He will only die if he wants to die. As long as Bheesma is alive he is protected. So in one hand he knows that as long as Bheesma on his side he obviously does not have to worry. But at the same token he thinks.\n\nIf I had more then I would have felt little better about it. So he said Apariyaptam Tadasnakam Balam Vishna Bhirakshitam Our strength protected by Bhishma still feels little insufficient. Whereas on the other side Pariyaptam twidam Etesham Balam Bhima, Bhirakshitam. Now they are protected by Bhima. And then after last time, Sid or somebody pointed out that this is not correct. Bhima was not the commander, but the commander was changing every day in this army.\n\nIf you read Mahabharata, and I have never read Mahabharata, so I'm not an authority.",
      "reflection": "Consider your own faith—not beliefs, but the deep orientation of your heart. What do you truly trust? What do you reach for in moments of crisis?\n\nToday, consciously choose one sattvic activity: eat consciously, speak kindly, offer genuine appreciation. Notice how it affects your inner state.\n\nThe sacred syllables Om Tat Sat point to ultimate reality. In your own words, what is most real to you? How does that understanding shape your life?"

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 17, sraddha traya vi bhagiyo, three types of sraddha. The chapter opened with Arjuna's question that if someone has not understood Sastras, or even having understood, he sets aside the prescription in the Shastras, but have faith in what he thinks is right in pursuing his faith, does that face be considered a Sattvik Rajasik or Tamasic? That's a simple question, simply because in the last chapter, the clear advice by Krishna is they follow the prescriptions of the Sastras in deciding what to do and what not to do. And as we have seen that Sastras literally means here the collective wisdom of your culture, collective wisdom of your society, collective wisdom of your ancestors. So unless I really rely on the wisdom of my ancestors, I will have no foundation really to decide what is right and wrong. Any profession, any science, you build on what was already been tried and true and proven in the labs or in workshops and then say, now where do I go from here?\n\nSo the clear prescription was not to ignore the wisdom of your ancestors, your civilization, your culture, and then decide what is right and wrong for you. It's not saying that you don't think yourself, but think based on the tried and true wisdom. When we go to high school and learn chemistry and the teacher says H2O makes water, well, you have to have some faith in him. Unless you have faith, you will not learn, because you have faith in the teacher that you will accept that and then you will prove yourself going to the lab. So the prescription was follow the Sastras and decide what to do and not to do. Arjuna's question is, if someone completely sets aside the prescription in Sastras for lack of knowledge or lack of faith in the Sastras, but he has a faith in something he believes in, does that faith to be classified as Sattvik Rajasik or Tamasic?\n\nBecause we have seen, everything can be classified Sattvik Raja Segura, Thomas Bhagavan said, I'll tell you, it's not a one label fits all type of an answer. Your faith will be as you are. My faith will be as per my experiences. Every time I walk into the airport and I'm absolutely sure that the plane will be on time. If last few times I went there plane was on time, I'll tell it will be on time. But last few times I'd been going there always late.\n\nWhat will be my faith? Chances are my flight will be delayed. So anytime I'm going to India, what I do is I leave about six hours of gap between when I go from Richmond to New Jersey airport and New Jersey to Mumbai. We have no faith that the flight from Richmond to New Jersey will take me in time. They say, well keep on two hours gap. No, no six hours gap.\n\nYou don't want to miss an international flight. That's my faith in our airline based on my experience. And then the other people may have other things. So Bhagavan said that your faith is Sattva Anurupa. It in accordance with your own self, your own core of your being, core of your mind. So my faith will be what my experiences are.\n\nFaith is something comes intuitively to you. More like a tendency. Why I like music, I don't know that's my tendency. But more I follow my tendency. More I will be following that path. More I have a faith in Gita, more Gita I will read more I read Gita, I have more faith in Gita.\n\nSo it's both are wedded together. More faith I have more I will pursue that path. More I pursue that path. My faith increases in that. So Bhagavan said, it is individual who decides whether he will have faith which is Sattvik, faith which is Rajasic or faith which is Tamasic depending on tendencies of his mind. Yajante Sattvika Devan so if overall makeup of my mind is Sattvik, what I will do?\n\nWell, I will follow Satwik beings. I will strive to pursue or worship divine beings. My role models depending on my tendencies. If I am pursuing wealth, my role model Bill Gates. If I want to be Great leader, my role model will be Mahatma Gandhi. If I want to spiritual, my role model will be Swami Chinmayananda.\n\nDepending on my faith will be. My role model would be. That's as simple as that. So Bhagavan said Sattvika Yajante Devan one whose makeup is Sattvik, predominantly Sattvik. These are not exclusive qualities of One person, one thing or one being. Everything is made up of some combination of Sattvik, Rajasik and Tamasic.\n\nBut if my mental makeup is predominantly Sattvik, I will be pursuing the Deva, the divine beings, Yaksa, Rakshansi, Rajasaha, those who are Rajasik will pursue or worship Yakshas and Rakshasas. From the Puranas we have the descriptions of Devas and Yakshas and Rakshasas, but it's simply told here is Sattvik will follow the divine beings, Rajasik will follow the one which has wealth and power. Yaksas are supposed to be wealthy beings. There is a story in Mahabharata 1 where Yudhishthir goes to this lake when he wants to drink water. That lake was controlled by a Yaksha. Yaksha said, you can't drink water till you answer all my questions.\n\nIf you answer all my questions, I'll let you take water. In other words, he was the controller of that lake. He was wealthy enough to control his lake. These days people own islands because they're wealthy. So the Yaksa that the wealthy beings, and as Swamiji points out here in Purana, I say they're Kubera's brothers or cousins. So they're wealthy beings or Rakshasa's immense power.\n\nThere are stories in Puranas about Rakshasas immense power. In other words, in even society there will be people who are Sattvic, people who are wealthy and powerful. So if my tendency Rajase Sikh, then I will be pursuing the wealthy and powerful. My quality is a Sattvik. I'll pursue the divine being, Preta Bhuta, Ganas, Ch' annye, Yajante, Tamasa, Janaha and the others who have Tamasic qualities, they will pursue the Preta and Bhuta Preten Bhut. We obviously know from our vernacular languages are the dead spirits.\n\nSpirits of the dead beings. Now in this society, obviously if there are three people pursuing the same goal of making a million, obviously one with a Sattvik will say let's find some creative way which will help the society in the same time will create the wealth. And that's how I'll make my million. Rajasik will say let's destroy my competition or take over some other and I'll get my million. And the last one will say let's pursue lottery, buy the mega million. All three are the same goal, but all three have a different avenue to reach there.\n\nNow all three are working hard. Satvik is Also working very hard to achieve his goal. Rajasik working as hard and Tamasik working is hard. But their means are different to achieve the same goal depending on where his faith is. The one who's pursuing lottery has the complete faith that he cannot get million in any other way. This is the only way he can make a million.\n\nOne who wants to employ himself in a business, he has a complete faith he can do that in that. And the one is Satwik. He's a complete faith that if he comes up with something good for the society, he will also benefit from him. Depending on your own experiences, your mental makeup is made. That mental makeup now defines where I have the faith in. That faith will lead me into my actions.\n\nSo Bhagavan said these faiths cannot be labeled because he is not following Sastra. The Rajasik, Tathuka, Tamasika. He may not know the Sastras but he has the Sattvic tendencies. He will follow Sattva. He may not know Sastras but he tended Raja Sikhs. He is following Rajasik and may not know Sastras because he's Tamasaik.\n\nHe's following Tamas. So Preta and Bhuta are the dead spirits. In other words, in normal society will consider that to be non starter. Somebody says, well Neil, why don't you buy a lottery? I never want anything in my life. Let's not waste my dollar.\n\nAt least I have a dollar. After that I won't have a dollar. But somebody is Faith and say, well, I have $10. I'll put nine of them in the lottery. I'm pretty against of lottery by the way, because we're taxing the people who can afford the least in the society. Lottery is good for the education.\n\nIt will reduce your taxes. No, it's a tax on the people who cannot afford that tax. Most lotteries are bought by people who least can afford it. But they are Preta, bhuta, ganans chany, asastra, vihitam, ghoram tapyante yei tapo janaha. Now I have my faith that this is how I can pursue my goal. My faith is dependent on my experiences.\n\nSo now I'm pursuing my goal vigorously because I'm as sincere as anybody else. But I'm pursuing in a field which I think is the most conducive for me to achieve that. Not knowing what is right or wrong because I did not take time to do it. But I'm working very hard. As I said last time, I want to go to New Jersey. But I'm driving as fast as I can on 95 south just because I didn't take time to figure out whether New Jersey north or south without knowing what is right or wrong from the tried and true wisdom of my society.\n\nIf I had just taken the triptych From AAA or GPS it would tell me New Jersey is the north. But I didn't take it. I didn't want to take that time. They're working very hard. They are pursuing these austerities with vigorously Dhamb ahankara sanyuktaha. Because they're filled with dhamba hypocrisy.\n\nTapasvaya ahankara ego. Nobody knows better than I do. So who are they to tell me that New Jersey isn't an orph? I know it got to be on this way. Ahankara sanyuktaha Kama rag Balan vitaha they were propelled to do this by what? Kama desire and raga attachment.\n\nKama and raga is propelling my actions and I think my happiness lies there. My goal is to achieve the happiness just as everybody else is. But I think my happiness lies in these actions where others are saying no. That's where you have the danger that you probably will be unhappy. We tell our kids, don't do that. But at that time he does not think he is going to get hurt.\n\nBut if he listens to you, you as an elder person learn from your own experience that jumping from that second floor is going to get you in trouble. Young person, at that age of 8 or 9 or 10, he thinks he can do anything he wants. Therefore he says kama ragaha Propelled by that desire and attachment, he wants to show off to his friend that he can jump from the second story. We have seen that in our childhood. Hypocrisy and arrogance. The ego filled with that and propelled by attachment and desire.\n\nAnd they are putting vigorous actions in the fields which they consider is appropriate for them. Karshayantaha Sarirastham bhutagramam a Chaita Saha. This is a description of someone who has completely ignored the advice from the Sastras. Bhagavad Gita we read every Sunday. What do we do after that? Bhagavad Gita says, but that's not really.\n\nSo now we fall into this category. Knowing fully well, we set aside the prescription in the Shastra. We are propelled by our desire and our attachments. And also we are Dhamba, ahankara sanyukta.",

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 17, Sratraya Vibhaga yoga, yoga of three types of faith. We have seen in last chapter. When Bhagavan ended the chapter, he gave the advice to Arjuna that do everything in life according to the advice given in the scriptures or by the sages. That's how you will incur more divine qualities. And these divine qualities are liberating. They will liberate you from your limitations which are creating sorrows in life.\n\nIf you do not follow that, you may incur more negative tendencies which will be more binding. They bind you to this material world. So Bhagavan said that follow the scriptural advice when you decide what to do and what not to do in this world. So obvious question Arjuna had was that what about the people who never had a chance to refer to scriptures? Either by their own choice, that they didn't think it was important, or they never had an opportunity to learn scriptures. And we can imagine in that society, probably the larger mass of people were not allowed to even learn scripture.\n\nArjuna had a very logical doubt. What happens to all those people? They are working in this world with faith. They have a faith that this is the right way to live life, which will give me happiness. Because at the end of the day we have discussed that the goal of life is to be happy. No matter who we are, our goal in life is very simple.\n\nWe all want to be happy. If I look at my entire life, it is divided into two pursuits. One is to achieve happiness and other is to avoid unhappiness. Bhagawan said, we are all working toward the same goal. But those who do not listen to the advice in the scriptures, the books of knowledge, teachers, wise people, ancestors, they suffer by developing wrong tendencies. But those who follow the advice from the wise people, because they've gone through that and come to the conclusion this is the right way to act, they will benefit from that and acquire the divine liberating tendencies.\n\nArjuna said the people in this world, working in their field, in their life, with faith but having no knowledge of what is prescribed in the scriptures, as I said, either by choice that they decided it's not worth it or they never had a chance to do it. So what is the nature of their sraddha? They have sraddha too, that this is where I'll get my happiness in life. I ask question, is it _Verses_, _Verses_ or _Verses_? Because if it is just out of my ignorance, they said that is tamasic. Bhagavan said it is all of the above.\n\nIt can be any of the three. If you have not referred to the scriptures but still have the faith, your faith can be of any of these three or it can be at any given time, one or the other. So it can be _Verses_, it can be _Verses_, it can be, it can be _Verses_. It is predominantly whatever my personality is, my faith will be according to my personality. As the faith, so is the person. As the person, so is the faith.\n\nSo it's a symbiotic relationship. Whichever field I choose to work in, I eventually become an expert in that. I go to architecture school, work in architecture field. More I work in that field, more I get knowledge. More my tendencies become to work in that field. And after about 30 years you become an expert in that field.\n\nAt that point somebody says, you made a mistake, Neil, you should have gone to medical school. You made lots of money. Yeah, I want to do it overnight but can't do it because my tendencies are now already firmly established in that field which I had been working all my life. Bhagwanta, same thing happens in your Sadh. Whatever sadh you have, you will continue to pursue that and same type of experiences. And it will make your siddha even firmer.\n\nMore your siddha becomes firmer, that becomes your nature, that becomes your personality. So that's how you can identify or label a person as a _Verses_ person, a _Verses_ person or a _Verses_ person, depending on the predominant nature of his personality. Bhagawan said it can be the _Verses_, _Verses_ or _Verses_. And then he said that depending on their personality, everything they do will be guided by that faith. Food they eat, the disciplines they practice, the charities they do, all of them will be guided by their personality. _Verses_, _Verses_, _Verses_ or _Verses_.\n\nAnd therefore he said, now we'll discuss in detail about what they are. So _Verses_ we have seen say Ahara Tuapi, Sarvasya Trivedho, Bhavati Priyaha, we have to pay attention to the words. Here all he's saying is the aha raha. The food also becomes dear to these people in three different ways. Depending on the personality, depending on your faith, depending on your tendencies, you will like one type of food or other. He did not say that these foods are satva _Verses_.\n\nBecause Tama said depending on your mood of your mind. We all know that there are times you like to eat some chatpatha. That times you really want to stay away from. Early morning somebody says have idli dosa. But we went to south and there early morning the breakfast comes idli dosa. And I said, are you serious that you want me to eat idli dosa?\n\nI thought it's lunchtime. No, in the breakfast also idli dosa. So depending on my mood, I would like one type of food or other. Yagna tapah, Tata Danam. Not only the food is driven by the mood of my mind. This sattvic, rajasic and tamasic are not the qualities of the things which we see in this world.\n\nThey're actually the qualities of my mind. The moods of my mind. That mind will decide whether that is satvik, _Verses_ or tamasaik. So depending on my mood, I will decide what I like. Bhagavan said, even the food you like will be dependent on the mood of your mind. Whether satvik, _Verses_, tamasik, _Verses_, even the efforts.\n\nIf you put _Verses_ basically, traditionally we call that hovam which we do with the fire and put sacrifice in it. Basically all your life you're doing _Verses_ by putting your efforts, offering your actions in this _Verses_ of your life. That will be also determined by the mood of your mind. The disciplines which you follow, tap austerities. But not that you sit down with a folded leg. Everything you think will discipline yourself is basically _Verses_.\n\nIf you have to run a marathon, you have to do _Verses_ for that, right? You have to train for that. That's your _Verses_. That's your _Verses_. That will be determined by mood of your mind. With the _Verses_, Islamic and _Verses_.\n\nWhere do I make charities when I give something to the society back? He says that will be also depending on the mood of my mind. Some people will donate toward the hospitals and health care. Some for the sports complex. Whatever you think is dear to your heart, that's where you are going to make the charities also Bhagawan said, everything in your life in other words will be driven by your faith, your conviction. Whether it is _Verses_, _Verses_ or _Verses_.\n\nYour life will be driven by that. And therefore he said, let's talk about how that affects you. _Verses_ _Verses_ _Verses_ _Verses_ _Verses_ _Verses_ _Verses_ _Verses_ _Verses_ _Verses_ _Verses_ _Verses_ _Verses_ _Verses_ _Verses_. You really have to be very careful in reading this verse. The first of all it says that the mood of my mind if it's sattvic, what do I want to get out of my life? That my sattvic mood will say that I want Aayu who I want to prolong my life with my efforts.\n\nI want to live a pure life, long life. Strength doesn't mean that I want to like a Hercules but mean I don't have to be helped by others. Ballah strength Arogyah Health. Health is my real nature. I don't complain any morning. Get up and say I don't know why I'm feeling so good.\n\nLet's call my doctor. There got to be something wrong. Because that's my nature. That's my real nature. I take it for granted. My health is my nature.\n\nIt is when I'm not healthy. Whatever it is, let's take care of it. Because it's not my real nature. So Bhagawan said, _Verses_ _Verses_ _Verses_. I want to be comfortable. Nobody wants to be uncomfortable.\n\nI want to choose the food which will make me comfortable. Preeti doesn't mean falling in love with somebody. _Verses_ means something. It makes me feel good. So I decide what my goal is in eating my food first. Then my goal in eating food is to have _Verses_ _Verses_ _Verses_ _Verses_ _Verses_.\n\nAnd I want to eat the food which promotes this kind of health. So that's the mood of my sattvic mind. And therefore the food he or she chooses would be rasya _Verses_ _Verses_ _Verses_ _Verses_ _Verses_. It doesn't mean oily and have lots of calories in it. But fresh _Verses_ substantial has nutritional value. _Verses_ which works with my system which I can digest.\n\n_Verses_ _Verses_ _Verses_ _Verses_. So either I Am leaving to eat or eating to leave is the question. Here he says, _Verses_, you'll first decide what I want to get out of my food. He says this is the purpose of my eating. I want to increase my _Verses_ _Verses_, my purity, my strength, my health and my comfort and my mood. So let's find out which food will be agreeable for me to do that.\n\nAnd we found that _Verses_, the fresh foods, pure food, healthy food are the ones which will give me that. Therefore the _Verses_ people like this type of food. That's all Bhagavan said here. He did not say eat this or don't eat this. The people who eat other foods are not good. He said because your goal of life is to increase these type of qualities of your life, you will choose that type of food.\n\nIn the next verse he says _Verses_ _Verses_, _Verses_ _Verses_ _Verses_, _Verses_, _Verses_, _Verses_, _Verses_, ahara, _Verses_, _Verses_. This type of food Rajasi people likes _Verses_, _Verses_ _Verses_, _Verses_. But in the end he says the result would be. See in the first one he said what the goal is. The _Verses_ person decided what his goal is first then chose the food. _Verses_ person decided that the food I like, that's why I'm going to eat it.\n\nThen Bhagavan said the result would be _Verses_, _Verses_, _Verses_, _Verses_. This food gives you _Verses_ discomfort. Anybody who went to a party, good dose of odors. And then at dinner at 10:30, tell me, was that the best night you had? It was uncomfortable. But I'll tell you what, I didn't sleep well that night.\n\nI wish I had control myself. Shoka, _Verses_ _Verses_ and disease. _Verses_ _Verses_, _Verses_, _Verses_, _Verses_ _Verses_, extremely hot _Verses_ _Verses_. We don't know _Verses_ are dry in _Verses_ _Verses_. Now Bhagavan didn't say this food is bad. He also did not say that don't eat this food.\n\nThe result of this food will be _Verses_, _Verses_, _Verses_, _Verses_. These foods will result in discomfort, grief and disease. But he said, while I'm _Verses_, I don't really have time to think about my food. So whatever is tasty, I will eat that in a rajasic Mode it is not that a group of people only eat this and group of people only eat this. When I am in a sattvic mood I'll be very careful about what I'm eating. When I'm in rajasic mood I'll say I don't really care when I'm on a one day trip.",
      "reflection": "Consider your own faith—not beliefs, but the deep orientation of your heart. What do you truly trust? What do you reach for in moments of crisis?\n\nToday, consciously choose one sattvic activity: eat consciously, speak kindly, offer genuine appreciation. Notice how it affects your inner state.\n\nThe sacred syllables Om Tat Sat point to ultimate reality. In your own words, what is most real to you? How does that understanding shape your life?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 17, Sraddha traya vi bhagyog three types of sraddhas. Culturally we are obsessed with classifications, so we classify everything. So in this case, Arjuna asked the question, if somebody who does not have any guidance from the Sastras, either voluntarily rejected or not available, but he still has faith and he's working, propelled by his faith, what type of faith that is? And Bhagavan says, as the man, so is his faith. Also as the faith, so is the man. So both have a very synergetic relationship.\n\nMy faith and who I am are basically very closely related to each other. And therefore this chapter is all about explaining the types of faith one can develop. If I have a goal to be one type of a person or other, I should examine what type of faith do I have? Or I should at least see that what type of faith will lead me to the goal which I want to achieve. So therefore the whole discussion about the three types of faith, and obviously it was quite anticipated after learning 16 chapters of Bhagavad Gita, that these three types of faith correspond with the three qualities of Maya, Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. Everything can be the Sattvik, Rajasik or Tamasic.\n\nOnce again we have to remember that nothing we have discussed ever said that one quality can be exclusive of other two. The one quality always comes with the little shades of the other two. But it is the predominance of my personality or my faith makes me who I am. The worship people do are also depending on their faith. Satvikas will worship the Devas, in other words, to get the illumination of their mind. They want the light of knowledge in their internal instruments that the Sattvic worship Rajasik wants to achieve.\n\nWealth, prosperity, something they think will give them infinite happiness. But we know it is transitory goal is the same for all of us, either liberation from our sorrows and unhappiness. We should examine whether my path is the one which will lead me to that goal. And therefore the Discussion. Even the likes and dislikes of the people also depend on their personality, their faith. Type of food I like depends on which mood my mind is in.\n\nSo when I'm in a sattvic mode, the type of food I like will be what we discussed. Sighnaha rasaha, that which promotes health. When I'm in rajasik mood, something which tastes good and when I'm tamasik mood, whatever is available now, this mood continues to change in our day to day life. Also at times I would love to listen to Jagjit Singh's ghazal. But there are times shut him off. This is not the time.\n\nI'm sometimes driving for like a couple of hours. You normally think that I'll be putting Jagjit Singh ghazal or two hours. I never listen to it. I want to listen to Bloomberg or CNBC or something which keeps my mind alert about this world. Because I'm not in a mood of listening to music. So mood of my mind determines what I like and dislike.\n\nThis mood continues to change. But my goal is to make sure the predominance of my mind is in the one or the other which I am currently convinced that which gives me the liberation from my sorrow. And therefore this elaborate discussion about these three faiths ofala kangsi bhi yajnaha. We have seen what they worship, what types of likes and dislikes they have and therefore what they receive, the ahara, what they eat, what they receive through their senses. Type of music I like. All that is depending on the mood of my mind.\n\nSo now it says what type of yajna, the actions. Yajna basically is a sacrifice. When we sacrifice something we are offering to someone. Every action of mine in this world is my Yajna, my offering to this world. But whether I'm offering with expectations or no expectations makes that action. Whether it's a yajna or a normal action.\n\nSo afala kangsi behajnah vidhidristo ya ijjyate yastavyam eveti manaha sama Dhaya sasatvikaha. That yajna or that sacrifice which is offered without desire for fruits and performed as per the ordinance. In other words, I have done it methodically. I can do something haphazardly or I can do something methodically. Both will have a different results. You know, when I first went to an architecture school, the first thing they teach you, they don't teach you actually you have to learn on your own.\n\nIn those days we used to have this, you know, drawing boards Then you put a paper on it and then you have T squares and set squares. Those are an engineering you understand now for first about two months. I never understood how to do that because nobody ever tells you how to align this paper. So you will haphazardly start something and never really comes out right. One day I had to ask my seniors, one of my friend who was a senior student said, you know Gupta, this never comes out right. All my borders are always.\n\nI said, neil, let me tell you how to do it. First thing, you set your board correctly. Then make sure your seat is comfortable so you reach everything. Then align your paper to your T square, not to your board. And that was like an eye opener to me. Oh, that's why his drawing comes out better than mine.\n\nBecause when I was putting the effort before, Aa Vidhi purvakam never tried to find out what is the right method or at least had no knowledge of it. Once I found out the right method, then I realized why it is so important. Before you start, make sure everything is correct. Drawing board is stable, my seat is stable, Nothing is falling apart. Everything is aligned. Now things work out much better than before.\n\nSo Bhagavan said, one who is doing vidhi purvakam with their vidhi drastah yastavyam eveti mana samadhaya sasatvikah with the firm faith that sacrifice is a duty, why am I doing it? Because we always say, well, if I don't have any desire for fruits, then there is no motivation, why would I be doing anything. If I say you go to work but there is no expectation for paycheck at the end of the month or end of two weeks, what is the motivation? Bhagawan said, it's other way around. Paycheck should be the byproduct of your actions and you have to be absolutely certain it will be there. Because you have a faith in the law of karma.\n\nLaw of karma said, your actions will be rewarded appropriately. One of the person I had interviewed long, long, long time ago when I was in Nairobi and I would never forget him. I never heard him, but I still never forget him. I asked him how much, what salary do you expect? And he said, whatever you think is appropriate is good for me. And then he added and said, I believe that because whatever I'm worth, I'll get paid, whether by this employer or the next one.\n\nYou may underpay me today, but my next employer will get the worth and he will pay me that I will never forget him. A complete faith in his ability and that My worth will be paid for. Bhagavan said, if you have that faith then only motivation you have to do your work is that this is my duty. That duty boundness is your motivation. I am a human being and therefore this is my duty. I'm a part of this community, therefore this is my duty.\n\nI'm part of this nation as a citizen. Therefore this is my duty. You take a role upon yourself and then see what your duty is and see whether you're performing those duties. And all your actions because of their role is now motivating you to perform them. When you become a father, you become a mother. Previously you were just a guy.\n\nNow you are a husband and then you are a father. Your duties continue to evolve and see whether you are motivated by those additional duties which you have taken upon yourself by taking this role. The Bhagavan says the one who is performing this Yajnas in this world performing sacrifices, offering their actions of Allah. First of all, no predetermined expectation for the results. The results will be there. If I put actions, results will be there.\n\nBut what that would be I do not know. Because the results are always in future. Actions are always in present. Results are always in somebody's control. Because if I act in this world, the world will react. So it's in control of the world.\n\nActions are always in my control. With that understanding I will not dissipate my energy in worrying about the results but use all my energy into my actions. Therefore my actions will be better. And therefore my results will be better. I have figured out my duty is this and also took some guidance. Therefore you become the first mom.\n\nAll those books and then you take seminars. That's why I'm so fascinated. When my son Neeraj was born, I was completely purvakam everything. When he was born I was working in my office because my father in law called me and said I think they had taken Meena to whatever the room. You can come as quickly as you can. I took no hurry part very seriously.\n\nSo by the time I reached there, he was already born. So if you take guidance then you will do things right? And obviously Meena never let me forget that even today. So that is the results of my AA Vidhi Purvakam. And then with a complete faith that this is what I want to do because this is my duty. And see such an action is satvikaha.\n\nSuch a yajna is satwik Yajna all my actions if I define and say oh falakanxi bhi in other words no predetermined result I have decided I go for an interview all the time. I remember my job is to just go and present myself. Whether they select me or not is their problem. So I come back and Jackie so how was the interview? Entry is always good. It is the result you have to worry about.\n\nBut Aa falakyanksi Vidhi dristha Sattvik Actions and yajnas are like that. Don't have any expectations. Do it because that's your duty and then be firm that that's what you want to do. ABHI Sandayatu Falam. First one we are doing it simply because it is my duty. I don't have a predetermined notion of what is going to come out or what results will be there and I'm firmly established in that action.\n\nABHI Sindha to falam Next one is okay, it's a slight difference. First one I had no expectance here. I want to make sure that if I do this I want to get this thing out of it before I make a donation. We ask so what kind of a recognition you will have in your organization for me? Can I get a seat on your board or what other things you are going to do for us or any action we can say that which I want to have a predetermined falaam that ABHI Sandhya the Falam Dhambharyam API chay vayat I'm doing it because I want to show off. I say well let me give a concert where I'm going to show off how good a singer I am.\n\nIjjyatai Bharata Sreshta Vidhirajasam There are only two motivation I have in performing these actions. One is I want to show off and acquire something which is predetermined. Therefore that motivates me.",

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 17, Shraddha vibhagyur yoga three types of Shraddha so we are coming to the concluding portion of Bhagavad Gita and some of us who had started Bhagavad Gita from chapter one and have gone through all 16 chapters and now in the 17th chapter may start wondering what about the people who never get a chance to learn Bhagavad Gita? We are fortunate that we get chance to learn Bhagavad Gita one way or other. But what about the people who never thought about learning Bhagavad Gita or never had a chance to learn Bhagavad Gita? Thought does come to our mind. How do they leave their life in a manner which is appropriate? Similar question Arjuna asked in the beginning of this chapter.\n\nThe Bhaiwan says I learned from you all this knowledge which you have given me and I have Shraddha. But how about the people who have never gone through the scriptures or had the guidance from the scriptures? They also have Shraddha. Everyone has Shraddha something that we know. So how is their Shraddha is helping them or how do you classify their Shraddha? What kind of Shraddha is that without any basis of any guidance from any guru or scriptures?\n\nAnd Bhagavan said each person has a Shraddha according to his or her mental makeup. It as simple as that. Whatever my mental makeup is that will decide what type of things I will be convinced will give me happiness. Bhavan said that there are three types of Shraddha you find in people. One is Sattvik, other is Rajasic, third is Tamasic depending on the texture of the person's mind. We know that texture of our mind changes as the circumstances change.\n\nSo depending on my circumstances and the basic nature of my mind, my mind will be either in a Sattvic mode or in a Rajasic mode or a Tamasic mode. But with practice I can control mood of my mind. Even these circumstances are not conducive Bhagawan said that becomes your predominant nature. Some people, no matter what it is, get angry. Some people, no matter what situation has come, they enter the room and people will be all agitated. But one said that because that is your basic nature.\n\nYour basic nature is what is predominantly the life you are living and how you are reacting to the situations. And that makes up your mental texture. And as your mental texture, so is your faith. And as your faith, so will be your mental texture. So we'll go back and forth between who I am, what I have faith in, what my faith in what make me who I am. So what are the three types of Shraddha?\n\nAnd this Shraddha is so powerful that it will lead your life. It will guide your life. Wherever I have my conviction that this is right. This is what will give me happiness. It will pursue that path. So our life is not really divided.\n\nWhat I do in one aspect of my life does not affect the other aspect of my life. Even though we think so well, I compartmentalize my life. My professional life is different than my personal life. In reality there is nothing like that. Who you are will permeate through entire life that you live. Whether it is personal, professional, social, sacred.\n\nSo Bhagawan said that that's very important. That you control the texture of your mind. Because that will exhibit your qualities no matter what you are doing. And therefore he said that even to something as simple as Ahar food also you will pursue according to the mental makeup of yours. So in the beginning we had talked about three types of people. What type of food they will like.\n\nThat is something which will give him nourishment, life giving, health. When you're Rajasic, you will like something which is tasty, feel good food, comfort food. As soon as the word comfort comes, you know it's not really healthy. There is a restaurant in downtown. Basically special comfort food. Finally realized that it's all loaded with calories.\n\nThat's why it's good. That's why it's good. I don't know why Bhagavan made it that way. Why not comfort food? I always question that why the fried food is not the healthiest food. So up till now people are saying the low fat milk, skim milk, low fat.\n\nI just read article in New York Times said the whole milk is now rising in popularity. Because now the research says the whole milk is actually healthier than your skim milk. Still he said the American association, whatever the doctors recommend that you should have the low calorie diet. But the low calorie diet is gradually losing its glitter. So Bhagavan said that the person with Sattvic mood will find something which is nourishing and health giving. Rajesh will find something which tastes good and comfort food and it's a tamasic.\n\nWill get anything that is available. Does not matter whether it is good or bad. Then we said even the Yajna they perform in a broader sense. All my efforts are basically offered in the Yajna of my life. My life is a Yajna and I am offering all my efforts into it to achieve something good. Bhagawan saying the Yajna is for the greater good.\n\nEven when I consider that I'm doing something for the greater good it will be all as per my mental makeup. Even though I may have good intentions but I may end up doing something which may not be helpful to others. Road to hell is paved with good intentions. I think the rolling stone or somebody said that. So sometimes even though I have good intention my mental makeup will make me put efforts in place where I feel right. They may not be right.\n\nTherefore he says the Sattvik will put efforts where it is. He has figured out what is the right way to put actions. With faith, with guidance that he will put his effort. Furniture I buy and then I'm so impatient. Let's not worry about it. Let's start putting it together.\n\nHalfway I realized that I missed couple of steps. I have to go back and undo it. He said the Sattvik person will do it. Whatever he does, he'll find out the right way to do it. A Rajasic person will say let's get it done. Right or wrong, let's get it done.\n\nBecause I want a result instantaneously. That which gives me result instantaneously. That's what I want to do. You don't have patience to go through this step by step or Vidhi Purvakam. So because we want instantaneous result, I sing a song and people who are just like me who doesn't know what music is say great, you are doing very well. That's what I was looking for.\n\nSo that's Rajasic Yajna without any method but have a result, a fruit in mind. And then last one we have seen, Yajna is that without any Vidhi I don't even have faith in it. But it's supposed to Be done as per the society's norm. Or people think I'm not doing right, let's do it anyway. Is this factor of safety before exam go to the temple? I knew that's not really going to help.\n\nBut you might as well do it because there is no harm. Just as a factor of safety. Maybe let's go to the temple and say bhagavan, take care. Tomorrow I have an exam without faith and without any method, without any reason. That Yajna Bhagavan says Tamashi Yajna. Then we came to the Tapas.\n\nThis faith will affect ahaar, Yajna, tapa and Dana. So now we came to the Tapas part. Tapas austerities or we loosely translate as disciplines which we follow. We discipline ourselves so that we can get some benefit out of it. We exercise routinely because of our good health. I want to run a marathon.\n\nI have to prepare myself. So when we started this discussion, Bhagavan described three types of Tapas. The next is Tapas at the speech level. And third is Tapas at the mental level. There thoughts level. So at the physical level.\n\nIn my activities, Bhagawan described that worship of the Devas, Dwijah, Prajnah and guru deities, divine beings, twice born, wise people. And your guru Ahinsa Shaucam considered sari Tapas. All of us at some level or other, we try to do that in our activity. The next speech, whatever I speak is non agitating to others. It is truth but sweet sounding truth. It is beneficial to others.\n\nThen it's a Tapas at the speech level and then Tapas at the mind level. Where my mind is silent and it is not creating unnecessary noise in the background. Then Bhagavan says that at the thought level. So my thoughts are discipline. My thoughts are always about my highest goal which is to achieve that oneness with the God as we call it. But in reality what we are looking for is unbroken happiness.\n\nWhen I achieve a state where my happiness remains permanent, it's not temporary, it's not coming and going. Bhagawan said that's at the thought level. We know that most of us try at the physical level. Almost majority of the people will fall into a category where they are trying their Tapas at the actions level. Where we fail is at the speech level. But then some people because we think that saying something is not hurting anybody.\n\nI'm Ahimsa Sack, but I say all the things will hurt Other people. But I'm not hitting him, I'm not hurting him. I'm just saying things we hear in media all the time these days. But Bhagawan said that's also very harmful. Therefore that's very important. So majority will fall and stop at the physical level this Tapas and actions but fail to do it at speech level.\n\nThen out of the remaining there are few who try hard to be at the speech level but most of us fail at the thought level. Because that I think nobody knows what I'm thinking. Nobody has any clue what I'm thinking. Only my outward actions and my speech is the only thing people are noticing or judging me from. Most of our lives we're doing things for others to judge me, right? That's why I said all marketing works very well.\n\nBecause all these people in marketing psychology figured out we never think about what this will look on me. We're only thinking about what it looks on others. So when we look at Tom Cruise wearing a suit which looks good on him, so I think it looks good on him, it should look good on me. So we try to judge ourselves by reflecting in the mirror of the society. And we think that what I am thinking in my mind nobody knows. And therefore we fail to do Tapas at the thought level.\n\nRur Bhagawan said all three when performed together will only yield the good results. So the next verse says Shraddhaya Parayant Taptam tapah trivedham Narayan Phalakangsi Phalakangsi Bhi Yuktehi satvikam pari chaksa Daya A man with firm devotion Shraddhaya parayaha with the firm faith. When a person is practicing all these three Tapasat trivedham all three when he's practicing of Falakaanxi vihi and he has no particular gain in mind when I'm doing Tapas also I shouldn't be expecting a particular result. Because I must have a complete faith in the Karma Phaladata that if I put my efforts the results will be there. So I constantly hear from my staff and say Neel, I don't think that we come on Sunday and work that anybody is appreciating. I said, but I don't know that you came on Sunday.\n\nDid you put down your timesheet that you were here on Sunday?",
      "reflection": "Consider your own faith—not beliefs, but the deep orientation of your heart. What do you truly trust? What do you reach for in moments of crisis?\n\nToday, consciously choose one sattvic activity: eat consciously, speak kindly, offer genuine appreciation. Notice how it affects your inner state.\n\nThe sacred syllables Om Tat Sat point to ultimate reality. In your own words, what is most real to you? How does that understanding shape your life?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 17, Sadhatraya Vibhaga yoga, yoga of three types of faiths. We had been learning in Bhagavad Gita that our goal in life is to find ultimate happiness. And one thing we have noticed in our life is that I only can feel happy when my mind is happy. So the goal is to keep this mind in a happy mode. And for that I have to purify my mind, purify my mind and intellect, which is an internal instrument to achieve the ultimate goal of liberation, liberation from my limitations. Right now, the limitations which I have create sorrows and anxieties and regrets.\n\nSo to become ultimately happy, I need to get out of my limitations. Limitations are right now because of my identification with this body, mind and intellect. Mind is the tool I use to decide whether I am happy or unhappy. So my first goal is to purify my mind. So mind remains in a happy mode. So the Mana Prasadah.\n\nSo we have seen in this chapter that as my mind, so is my personality, my faith. Bhagavan said that there is someone who has no guidance from the scriptures or from a guru, or from any wise person. But each one of us has faith that I will achieve happiness one way or other. And then wherever my faith is that my happiness lies, those are the pursuit I'll pursue. So Arjuna asked Bhagavan, what kind of a faith is that? Bhagawan said, this faith can be a free, different kind.\n\nThis faith also can be Satva, Garajasik or Tamasic, depending your mind being Satvik, rajas, tamasic, you will be convinced your happiness lies in those type of endeavors. So Bhagawan said that your faith, your mental texture, as the faith, so is the person, as the person, so is the faith. So it is very important for me to understand what is making me unhappy, what makes my mind unhappy. And therefore this chapter for us to understand that how Sattva, rajas and Tamas affect my life. So the first thing we have seen, Bhagavan said that everything you do in life will be controlled by your mental makeup, the type of food you like, type of food you will take, the yagnas which you perform. All the effort you put for the greater good.\n\nBut that greater good also include myself. So therefore, all my actions which I perform are basically to achieve their ultimate goal of becoming happy. So those actions which I offer as my sacrifice to get my happiness is my yajna. See, those yajnas will be also of three different types. Sattvik, rajasik and tamasic. So we have seen that the ahara, the sattvik people will eat what is good for them.\n\nAnd nutritious rajasik people will eat whatever is is pleasant, it feels good. And Tamasic will whatever they take, yajnas, sattvik people will perform without any expectations for the fruits. That rajasik will have a goal in mind, what he wants to get out of these efforts. And Tamasic just doesn't care. Then we talked about tapas austerities. But in our life we call it discipline.\n\nI have to discipline myself to do this. I was just reading this morning. Now, the new research says that not doing exercise is as bad as smoking cigarettes every day. I better be careful because I'm the one who obviously does not get motivated for exercise that easily. So now I say, oh, I need to exercise. That's something I'm telling myself.\n\nI need to perform to be in a good shape. I want to be in good shape because I want to be healthy. I want to be healthy because that makes me happy. So ultimately, all the tapas which we do, all the disciplines which we practice, are for my happiness. Bhagavan satisperformed at three different levels. You perform at your physical level in your actions, you perform at your speech level.\n\nAnd you perform at the mental level. So the actions level, My actions should be helping others and not harming others. All my activities, I keep in mind that my actions are for the greater good. Once I take care of the greater good, I am already included in it. Because any action performed by any one person in this universe affects the entire universe. We know that we are all connected with each other.\n\nIf one person in family is unhappy, it makes the whole family unhappy. So we know that that why I should be performing this for greater good. Because it ultimately will affect me if someone is suffering. That suffering will eventually come down to me. The bhagavan said that the tapas are performed at three different levels. My activities should be such that it is for the greater good, then at the speech level, my speech should be such that it is truth but pleasant sounding truth.\n\nAll we husbands have good idea. When your wife says, how do I look? Do you really want to be truthful or really you want to be? You can be truthful but has to be pleasant sounding. Satyamvada Priyam Vada Bhagawan said, your actions should be for the benefit of others only it should be beneficial. My speech should be not only truthful, pleasant, but for the benefit.\n\nIf I tell somebody a truth, it has to for his or her benefit, not just because I want to be Satya Vadi Harischandra. So it's at the speech level. And then at the mental level I may be acting in a manner that it looks so Satwik. I may be speaking so softly and nicely. But if there is noise in my mind which is completely different from my actions and my speech is eventually affect my speech and my action. Therefore at the mental level, this tapas is Ta Bhagwan saying.\n\nNow when I'm performing, it can also be the same three categories of Sattvik, rajasic and tamasic. Again, my tapas is for not for getting anything out of it, but it is something I need to do. So that's the purification of your internal instrument. My tapas is to purify my internal instrument so that I can experience that happiness in my mind. And the last thing we are seeing is the Dana. Charity is our general idea is it is to help others.\n\nIn reality, charity is to help yourself. Therefore, Swami Vivekananda said, if you find somebody who is worthy of helping when you help, thank him to give opportunity to help so that I can help myself. Dhanam is for me to purify my mind and control my ego. So Dana gives me the opportunity to purify my mind by giving away things which are of abundance with me. So Dana is also a social phenomenon to keep the equilibrium in the society. We know that in any given society there will be income unequality.\n\nPeople are not born with the same resources and therefore there will be inequality. And if I happen to be the one who is fortunate enough to have more than what I need, it becomes my duty and it becomes my means to purify my mind by doing charities. So charities are strictly for me and not for others. So when the I perform charities, I must be very clear why I'm performing these charities. So there Bhagavan said that these charities can be seen as three types. Again, Sattvik Rajasik or Tamarsic.\n\nFirst one says Datvyam is. Very first requirement for an appropriate Sattvik Dha which will give you the most result of what you're looking for. What you're looking for in your life is to purify your mind to a point that it is always in a sunny bright mood and you're always happy. You do not want to be grouchy and unhappy, complaining and regretful. So to keep my mind in that mode, I'm performing all of this. I'm eating right food, I'm doing right yajna, I'm doing right tapas Bhagavan Chandn.\n\nWhen I do also, I have to keep in mind I'm doing it for me and therefore I should know how to make these charities. So the first requirement is data vyam idhi. I see a cause and realize there is no other way but for me to help them. You are going on a road and you see a little child is just about to get hit by a car. You don't really sit down and say there is Satvik actor Rajasi character. Is it going to be Tamashek?\n\nAt that point you have no other thought than I need to help that child get him or her out of the harm's way. So when you do a charity and you have that attitude, it has to be done, it has to be done then that's the right charity. And then when you give that, not by obliging that person as we were going to, actually you should thank him that you are obliging me to giving me a chance. If there's no one to help, who are you going to help? When we were at the old temple that we were having this annadhanam because every Sunday people who come there as you are feeding, who are already fed, it is not Anadanam. It is just a party you are having.\n\nEvery week we all get together. When a person needs food and give him food, that's Anadanam. Person is already fed, you can't give him food and say Bhagavan said, I'm not obliging you by doing this charity. Deshe kale cha patre cha ta danam sattvikam smrutam. When it is given at a right time, at a right place to the right person. So if I want to help somebody and that person is now sitting in a group of his friends and then going say you told me that you need help.\n\nHere is my Hundred dollars which you asked for. You are insulting him in front of his friends and families. He didn't want other people to know his problems. He came to you to ask for help and now you're helping him at the wrong place. Well, everybody's sitting and just having a normal conversation. Everyone say I'm going to help you.\n\nWrong place, wrong time. You should also not help somebody who you know that does not need any help. Sometimes people say I don't get chance to do all this social work. I want to do social work but people are not making me president of this organization. You shouldn't worry about it. The Bhagavad says that Patra only helps someone who really needs help and seeking help.\n\nWhen you find that opportunity, take that opportunity that is God's given to you. Consider that as God's blessing that you came across this opportunity to help that person and therefore you're helping. Bhagawan says that's a Sattvik dharam. You're not expecting anything out of it. Just like the example of a child in a harm's way. When you help that child you're not expecting anything, not even thank you from anybody.\n\nAt that point your only thought is I need to get that child out of the harm's way. It's exact same emotion you should have when you give somebody any help. Adana, that person needs help and I have means I need to help that person. Bhagwan says that's a satvik dhyana yatu prati upakaraartham falam uddi dash vapunah diya te pariklistam tadanam rajasam smrutam. In contrast to that that gift which is given in view to receive return falam uddasha. I'll make this donation and I can get this tax benefit.\n\nAnd at least people think that he is a good donor. I am doing this charities so it will help my business. So all companies try to we are connected. We give back all that is actually marketing.",

My speech should be not only truthful, pleasant, but for the benefit.\n\nIf I tell somebody a truth, it has to for his or her benefit, not just because I want to be Satya Vadi Harischandra. So it's at the speech level. And then at the mental level I may be acting in a manner that it looks so Satwik. I may be speaking so softly and nicely. But if there is noise in my mind which is completely different from my actions and my speech is eventually affect my speech and my action. Therefore at the mental level, this tapas is Ta Bhagwan saying.\n\nNow when I'm performing, it can also be the same three categories of Sattvik, rajasic and tamasic. Again, my tapas is for not for getting anything out of it, but it is something I need to do. So that's the purification of your internal instrument. My tapas is to purify my internal instrument so that I can experience that happiness in my mind. And the last thing we are seeing is the Dana. Charity is our general idea is it is to help others.\n\nIn reality, charity is to help yourself. Therefore, Swami Vivekananda said, if you find somebody who is worthy of helping when you help, thank him to give opportunity to help so that I can help myself. Dhanam is for me to purify my mind and control my ego. So Dana gives me the opportunity to purify my mind by giving away things which are of abundance with me. So Dana is also a social phenomenon to keep the equilibrium in the society. We know that in any given society there will be income unequality.\n\nPeople are not born with the same resources and therefore there will be inequality. And if I happen to be the one who is fortunate enough to have more than what I need, it becomes my duty and it becomes my means to purify my mind by doing charities. So charities are strictly for me and not for others. So when the I perform charities, I must be very clear why I'm performing these charities. So there Bhagavan said that these charities can be seen as three types. Again, Sattvik Rajasik or Tamarsic.\n\nFirst one says Datvyam is. Very first requirement for an appropriate Sattvik Dha which will give you the most result of what you're looking for. What you're looking for in your life is to purify your mind to a point that it is always in a sunny bright mood and you're always happy. You do not want to be grouchy and unhappy, complaining and regretful. So to keep my mind in that mode, I'm performing all of this. I'm eating right food, I'm doing right yajna, I'm doing right tapas Bhagavan Chandn.\n\nWhen I do also, I have to keep in mind I'm doing it for me and therefore I should know how to make these charities. So the first requirement is data vyam idhi. I see a cause and realize there is no other way but for me to help them. You are going on a road and you see a little child is just about to get hit by a car. You don't really sit down and say there is Satvik actor Rajasi character. Is it going to be Tamashek?\n\nAt that point you have no other thought than I need to help that child get him or her out of the harm's way. So when you do a charity and you have that attitude, it has to be done, it has to be done then that's the right charity. And then when you give that, not by obliging that person as we were going to, actually you should thank him that you are obliging me to giving me a chance. If there's no one to help, who are you going to help? When we were at the old temple that we were having this annadhanam because every Sunday people who come there as you are feeding, who are already fed, it is not Anadanam. It is just a party you are having.\n\nEvery week we all get together. When a person needs food and give him food, that's Anadanam. Person is already fed, you can't give him food and say Bhagavan said, I'm not obliging you by doing this charity. Deshe kale cha patre cha ta danam sattvikam smrutam. When it is given at a right time, at a right place to the right person. So if I want to help somebody and that person is now sitting in a group of his friends and then going say you told me that you need help.\n\nHere is my Hundred dollars which you asked for. You are insulting him in front of his friends and families. He didn't want other people to know his problems. He came to you to ask for help and now you're helping him at the wrong place. Well, everybody's sitting and just having a normal conversation. Everyone say I'm going to help you.\n\nWrong place, wrong time. You should also not help somebody who you know that does not need any help. Sometimes people say I don't get chance to do all this social work. I want to do social work but people are not making me president of this organization. You shouldn't worry about it. The Bhagavad says that Patra only helps someone who really needs help and seeking help.\n\nWhen you find that opportunity, take that opportunity that is God's given to you. Consider that as God's blessing that you came across this opportunity to help that person and therefore you're helping. Bhagawan says that's a Sattvik dharam. You're not expecting anything out of it. Just like the example of a child in a harm's way. When you help that child you're not expecting anything, not even thank you from anybody.\n\nAt that point your only thought is I need to get that child out of the harm's way. It's exact same emotion you should have when you give somebody any help. Adana, that person needs help and I have means I need to help that person. Bhagwan says that's a satvik dhyana yatu prati upakaraartham falam uddi dash vapunah diya te pariklistam tadanam rajasam smrutam. In contrast to that that gift which is given in view to receive return falam uddasha. I'll make this donation and I can get this tax benefit.\n\nAnd at least people think that he is a good donor. I am doing this charities so it will help my business. So all companies try to we are connected. We give back all that is actually marketing.",
      "reflection": "Consider your own faith—not beliefs, but the deep orientation of your heart. What do you truly trust? What do you reach for in moments of crisis?\n\nToday, consciously choose one sattvic activity: eat consciously, speak kindly, offer genuine appreciation. Notice how it affects your inner state.\n\nThe sacred syllables Om Tat Sat point to ultimate reality. In your own words, what is most real to you? How does that understanding shape your life?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 17, Sraddhatriya Vipaga Yoga, and what we have seen so far in this chapter and in the Bhagavad Gita is that we have heard that our body is what we eat, our mind is what we think, and what we think is dependent on our faith, dependent on what we are convinced of or convicted of. So thinking is driven by our convictions. And therefore who I am is all about my convictions. So who I am is depending on my faith. And therefore this chapter elaborates what are the types of faiths a person can have? Then we have broadly classified, just as everything else, in three categories.\n\nFaith can be Sattvic, faith can be Rajasic, faith can be Tamasic, and depending on that, I may be a Sattvic person, a Rajasic person or a Tamasik person, and my understanding of that will help me how do I change my faith so that my thinking changes, so my behavior changes, my mind changes and ultimately gives me the result which I'm looking for, which is in the end is to achieve happiness. You're all looking for one and one thing alone is to get out of our limitations and sorrows. So Bhagavan has described in this chapter the three types of faith and how it controls our Ahara, our Yagna, our Tapa and our Dana. As we have seen last time, it is what we take from this world, how we interact and connect with this world, how we discipline ourselves for what we want and then what we give back to this world, all dependent on my faith. And therefore my goal obviously is to make my faith more Sattvic. If I detect that I have Tamasic faith, I want to make it more Rajasic.\n\nIf I detect I'm more Rajasya, make it Sattvik. Eventually I can get to my goal of achieving that happiness. So now our question was, well, I may or may not have that capability, and I may be all filled with Rajasic faith and will not be able to change that. So the last three _Verses_ we have seen says there is One way of mitigating that and that we have seen it says that there is a three fold indicator of that transcendental reality, the ultimate reality, the one unifying entity which binds us all, which is indicated in the Sastras is Om Tatsat. Om is the transcendental form of the Lord that I have learned in the previous chapter. The Astadha Prakrithi, Eightfold manifest Prakriti of the Lord.\n\nSo everything which I see and perceive and feel is basically nothing but his manifestation. But then I come to the conclusion, maybe if I put everything together that's Lord, or if I put all the parts together, will it make a machine? The question is how you put it together. So all this part putting together does not still make the identity of the Lord. That is something beyond that. Lower Prakriti and higher Prakriti.\n\nI have all these parts and say if I put all this together, it will be the whole. No, it has to be in a particular manner. Then only that machine functions as it's supposed to be functioning. All these parts, I have to put it together and perceive it in a way that it will reveal the Lord's identity. And that's the transcendental part, is how to see this whole in a manner that I can see Him. I see this world in its parts, but I can't put it together as his identity.\n\nThat's the Aum, a transcendental part. Om is the indicator of that. And if I can remember that, that all that I see, perceive and things put together, I will never be able to understand Lord. But Om is the reality. My faith may be Rajasek, it may be even Tamasek, but it will transform into Sattvic faith. That's basically a way out given to us by this last three _Verses_.\n\nOm, Tatsat, ITI Nirdeshaha, Brahmanatrivi, Dasmutah. These are the three indicators of of that supreme reality. I know all the parts right now, but I can't put together the machine. I can't put together its real identity. So Aum is the one indicator. Tat we have seen is another indicator.\n\nThat is that that which I constantly keep referring to the God, the Lord, that entity other than this which I can perceive, feel, touch and vouch for it, that it exists. That which I cannot vouch for, that it exists, does exist, but beyond my perception. So that's Tat and Sat, the existence or the truth. Truth is that which exists in all periods of time. In other words, it was true yesterday, it is true today and it will be true tomorrow. That is satisfaction.\n\nSo these are the three indicators. And Bhagavan said that those who are Brahmavadi Na. One who are completely convinced about the existence of that ultimate reality. They are the Brahmavadina Muriwad Capitalism, Samajwad socialism. Because they're convinced that this is the only way to help the society. By Mudi Vaad, By Samaj Vaad Vaad means I'm completely on side of that.\n\nThose who are completely convinced that Brahman is the only reality. He says they will start all their activities with uttering Om. Utterance means remembrance. It's indication to me that Om is the ultimate reality. I may be perceiving a difference between you and I right now. And therefore I may have developed a liking or disliking for you.\n\nBut Om is the ultimate reality which manifest as me. Which manifest as you. As long as I have that thought in the beginning, whatever I do afterwards will be purified. So the smart Om Ithi Udahrutta Yajna Dana Tapaha Kriyaha. We have discussed all that in the previous _Verses_. That activities we are performing in this world are.\n\nWe receive from the world. We interact with the world. We connect with this world. We prepare ourselves to how to interact with the world. And then we give back to the world all this which we are doing. First, those who are Brahmavadi Nam.\n\nWe see that those who are seeking liberation. I have come to the conclusion that there is no way that in my present state of limitedness the ultimate goal of infinite happiness is possible. I have come to that clear understanding that no matter how hard I try with my mind and intellect and body that unbroken happiness is not possible at all. It's only possible if I can identify with that. That which is unlimited. That which has no limitations.\n\nThat which has no sorrows. That which has no competition. That which all pervading. People who are seeking moksha. And we are all Moksha Kanksi bhi. Believe it or not, we want liberation for anything which we think is our limitation.\n\nSo all of us who are aware of our limitations and are not very happy with it. If you're happy with it, you're not a Moksha Kangshi being. If I have some limitations by think this is good enough, then I'm not taking liberation. But we all of us have one limitation. Which we can stand is running into a situation which makes me unhappy that I cannot stand. Therefore I'm constantly trying to avoid the things which are creating sorrows and want to pursue the things which gives me happiness.\n\nSo at least I want to get rid of that limitations that runs me into this situation which gives me unhappiness. So Bhagavan says those Moksa kanksi bhi who wants to get rid of those limitations they will start all their activities. The same one that Yajna tapa danak kriyaha with Tat Tat anabisandaya falam Yajna tapah kriyaha. They have come to the conclusion that if I remember him as the Karma Falada he is the giver of the fruits. So I leave it to him and do all my activities. For giving me the result, it will give me that liberation.\n\nSo we have learned that as Karma Yoga, the last one Sad Bhavai Sadhu Bhavicha Sad Adhi ITI Etat Prayudyate prasaste Karmani Tatha Sat Shabdaha Partha Yudjate. Sat is used in the sense of reality. Sat, as we have said is only that can be proven true in all three phases. In the past, in the present, in the future. Everything else is unreal. It existed one point of time in time and space, another period of time.\n\nIt has no existence whatsoever. It's completely gone. Just like a film on a screen or a hologram. It exists in my perception for a period of time. So the lamp is shut off. The word sat is used in the sense of reality and also for goodness.\n\nNow we are coming back to the world which you and I know. Transcendental unlimitedness. The world of good and bad. Our world is divided by good and bad. Bhagavan said the real and the good is indicated in this world as Satan. Sattvaj is as we say, there are values and there are universal values.\n\nThere are values may be applicable to me in this situation which may not be applicable in other situations. Well, those are transitory values. I work for a company and what are the values of the company? It only applies to me as long as I am there. But there are values which applies to me whether I'm working or not. Whether I'm working for this company or not or that company or not.\n\nThose are universal values. Therefore we have said even before the civilization started, human beings knew what is right and what is wrong. Even before any religious were established, they knew what is good and what is bad. Those universal good and those universal truth are indicated as satisfaction. It is not dependent on any culture, not dependent on any beliefs, but those are the universal good and universal reality. So Bhagawan said, the word sat is used in this sense of reality and of goodness and also partha.\n\nThe word is used in the sense of auspiciousness. Anything which is good is auspicious. And therefore you start that work, same thing, yajna pohadana kriya with that word sat. Then may this be auspicious. May this act of mine be of goodness and of kindness and of reality. So you start with sat.\n\nSo obviously in the Sikh tradition, sat word is given the most important satsriyakaal, that sat, which is akal, which is timeless, no beginning, no end. So that sat is uttered by so yagne tapasi dhane chastityhi sat itiucha de. Therefore, if I am the one who is clearly very aware of the good and bad in this world, I divide my world into this is the good world and this is the evil world. This is good for me, this is bad for me. Then I should start all my activities. Bhagavan says, yagne tapasi dhane cha activities remaining the same.\n\nWhether it is my tamasic faith, my rajasic faith, or the sattvic faith, it is what my mind tells me is good, I'm gonna do. No matter how much I tell you this is good for you, as long as your mind does not tell you it is good, you will not be able to follow. Everybody says, do this. Okay, okay, I'll think about. But the thinking part never comes because I have already decided it is not worth thinking. So Bhagavan said, those of us, that's what say yajne tapasidane chasthiti hi.\n\nTo be steadfast in my yajnadananda tapa. I do some yajnas, but occasionally yajna, in a sense, some sacrifice. But occasionally I'm not steadfast. I sometimes get all excited and say, I think we should all do some charitman or some kind of a community service. You know, we organize this, and then after about two weeks, everything kind of gradually dies down.",
      "reflection": "Consider your own faith—not beliefs, but the deep orientation of your heart. What do you truly trust?

This is the last chapter in Bhagavad Gita, basically the revision or summary. We are going to review all that we have discussed so far in Bhagavad Gita up to chapter 17. From chapter second through 17, chapter one was introduction, setting of a stage, telling us what situation we are in.\n\nWe are in Arjuna situation. We face this battle of life and in that we come across situations which are not clear cut. So that was the scenario. And then Bhagavan gave us the whole discourse about why we are so confused. We are confused because our basic fault, as the Christians will call it, a basic sin or basic misconception about ourselves, who we are. We consider this mortal being is me, whereas I, as I consider myself, is imperishable.\n\nWe learnt that once you change that paradigm, that this is not me. This body, mind and intellect is not me. I, who I consider I, is the owner of this body, mind and intellect, this body, my intellect. I are the equipment I use to transact with this world. The mortality is for the body, mind and intellect, particularly for the body. When it comes to this life, this life, the body will survive from the birth to death and then it will decay.\n\nBut the mind and intellect will continue its journey till it gives up its own attachment and identification. So we have learned in the first six chapters that the basic technique of detaching oneself from this limited self that I am and then attaching the supreme self is Karma Yoga. We have seen that there are two aspects of Karma Yoga. One is doing actions without any expectations for the fruits, then act for the greater good. So these are the two main thing we have learned. They equate it to Tyaga and sannyasa.\n\nSo these two words we have heard over and over again in this discourse, Tyaga. We constantly talk about giving up, abandonment of what is what we have to learn, what to give up is what we have to learn Chapter three said Karma Fala Tyaga is the Tyaga. You should give up the expectations of a particular result from your actions is what you need to give up. Then later chapters 4 and 5 talk about renouncing actions in knowledge. Right now I consider I am the doer and therefore I expect the results. Then I become the enjoyer and the sufferer.\n\nIf I give up that I the doership then the sufferer and enjoyer also goes away. As long as I consider I am the doer, all the results are binding to me. Because I take the responsibility, I take the ownership of my actions. Then the results which comes in future. Actions are always in present. Results are always in future.\n\nNo matter what a time lag is. By the time I speak and you hear and you respond, there is a time lag. It may be a fraction of a second but there is always a time lag. So the actions are always in present, results are always in future. The future is one which I do not have a control over. I only have control of the present.\n\nI can only live in present. I can only act in present. So how do I make myself more efficient? In present is what we have learned in those chapters. Give up the expectations of the fruits. Because I do not have any control over what the fruits would be.\n\nI am not the judge of what the rewards of my accent should be. Even though I have expectation. Karma Phala Datta is always someone else. Whether we consider the Almighty or the world. I go for an interview for a project. All I can do is make presentation.\n\nThe result is always in the hand of the selection committee who I have no control over. But all I can do is make myself as efficient and proficient and effective as possible. The Bhagavan said, if you do not think about the results, you will be more efficient. You are not wasting your energy into thinking about what will come out of actions. Then when we talked about the second set of chapters where we have described the Bhagavan's identity, who the Bhagavan is. Then we say Bhagavan has two aspects.\n\nOne is Purusha which is the substratum for all things and beings. What we call it a myself. You call it yourself, he call it himself, she call it herself, it call itself that Self is the Purusha which is permeating through all things and beings as existence. And then there is the manifest aspect of the Prakriti which is the myriads of forms and names and colors. And it's constantly changing. And we have Come to learn that that's because of the Maya.\n\nThis Prakriti is the manifest world of plurality, is a product of Maya. Maya is that which is not, but appears to be that. In Newtonian physics, the atom looks so solid, but on further investigation, you found there is no solid material in atom at all. There is nothing that we have found so far which is solid in atom, but it does act as a very solid material. Therefore, I can punch this table. If I punch this table, it will hurt because it is very solid.\n\nThis, which appears to be real, but it is not, is the product of Maya. And this Maya has three gunas. As we have discussed, this Maya is supported by the three constituent parts, the Sattva, rajas and tamas. The purity, the reality, the truth, Rajas which is the activity, and Tamas, which is inertia. To remain as an entity in space and time in inertia, it has to remain as it is for you and I to pursue it. Satva, rajas and Tamas are the three aspects which govern our life as part of the Prakriti.\n\nSo we have now five things we obviously have to focus on. Kyaga and Sannyasa, the means to achieve the ultimate happiness that I am seeking. And then what is binding me to this world. This identification which I have with this body, mind, intellect, is because of the three Guru, Nada, Prakriti, the Sattva, Raja, Santamas. So this chapter, all the concepts which we have learned in various chapters, combines them into one cohesive teachings in how one should use this knowledge to make your life better and achieve your final goal of liberating yourself from unhappiness and sorrows. So just as we have seen previously, Arjuna time and again asked questions to make sure that he understood correctly.\n\nIn chapter eight, he said, these are the following terms. You said, you said Brahman, you said Dharma, you said Karma, you said Adhyatma, you said Adhi Devata. Explain to me all this in detail. Then we had this whole discussion in chapter eight, this chapter, he starts with saying, let's make sure that I understood correctly that use two terms, kyaga and sannyasa. They both seem same thing. When somebody says, give up drinking coffee.\n\nAnd then I say, I renounce coffee, both one and the same thing. I'm just not drinking coffee. There's got to be difference. Otherwise you won't be talking about caga and Sannyasa in two different contexts. So I would like to know. So the chapter starts with Arjuna saying Sanyasasya Mahabaho tattoom ichami veditum.\n\nI want to know about Sannyasa in its essence. And also I want to know about tyaga in its essence. I want to know what is Tyaga and what is Sannyasa. He addresses Krishna with two different Hrishikesha and Keshini Sudhana. Krishna has various names depending on how you see him. So one is Keshini Sudhana, the slayer of demon Keshini.\n\nSo for those who have read Mahabharata or Bhagavadpura, Keshani was a demon was sent to kill Krishna in the form of a horse and Krishna slayed him by splitting him into two. So one who basically separates ignorance from knowledge is Keshini Sudhana. He is also called Hrishikesha. Hrishikesha has several meanings. One of the one where they control over the senses. One who is the master of the sense of Hrishikesha.\n\nOthers one who has a short hair. So Arjuna addresses him saying Krishna Hrushiki, explain to me what is the difference between Tyaga and Sannyasa so that I am not confused. He talked about giving up things and also renouncing things. If we reflect back, we have talked about Tyaga is Karma fala Tyaga giving him the sense of agency that I am the doer is Sannyasa. We discussed that previously in the Bhagavad Gita. But Krishna now answers it slightly differently and he says Sri Bhagavanu vacha kamyanam Karmanam Nyasam sanyasam kabayo viduhu Giving up desire prompted actions.\n\nKavi means sage kavi in Gujarati in many vernacular languages. So in Gujarati we say this Vijayana pomoche ravi dhya pomuche kavi in mother where the sun cannot shine. Poet can take his imagination there. So the Kavi in the Vedic time are the people who are seeing the truth and then put it in poetic language. In rug vedas and sama vedas, those who had the vision of the truth, they are the kavis. So the many kavis kava yo ho.\n\nMany Kavis say that giving up desire prompted actions is sannyasa. Desire prompted actions only come in place if it is driven by my ego. If I think I am the doer and therefore I want something out of my action, so those actions are prompted by my self interest. By my ego are the desire prompted actions. So if I give up the sense of agency as I the doer, there Won't be any desire prompted. All actions become for the greater good.\n\nAnd that's where we have the concepts of offering all the actions to the Lord. If I come to the conclusion, as we have learnt in Bhagavad Gita that all actions are performed by this body, mind and intellect and the qualities of the body, mind and intellect. Because why Neil, you are not the biggest wrestler in town? Is that because I don't have the equipment? I don't have the body to wrestle. Everything which I do in life is depending on what equipment I have.\n\nWhat is the proper apparatus I have? I like to sing because I have been given a voice which is appropriate for singing. If it was not, I would have no desire to sing. I don't have desire to dance. Because apparatus is not correct. So Bhagavan says that all actions are performed by the quality of your equipment and your senses which is part of this Prakriti.\n\nBut I consider them to be my actions by misconception that this is me. If I correct that conception then all actions will not be for me. And therefore they will not be desire prompted. So he says Sannyasa is simply giving up the desire prompted access. Kamyanam Karmanam Nyasa Sarvakarma Falat Tyagam Prahuhu Tyagam Vichakshanah Vichakshanah. Wise people who have observed how this world works and how the actions are performed.\n\nAnd how the results of the actions are affected by our expectations. You see, those people have said Sarvakarma Falatyagam. Not some I can give up the falatyagam for the actions which are of no value. But all the actions which I perform if I give up the expectation for the fruits. And we have discussed in detail in chapter three what is Karma Faladhyyagam. Karma Falat Yaga is simply not to expect a particular result.\n\nResult will come in the law of nature. Once I perform action, there will be a reaction. As in physics we say it will be equal and opposite.",
      "reflection": "The Gita's final teaching is surrender. Not passive resignation, but active trust. Having done what you can, release the outcome.\n\nToday, identify one situation where you're holding on too tightly. Practice opening your hands. Let it be what it will be.\n\nArjuna's journey from paralysis to clarity, from confusion to conviction, is available to each of us. The teaching has been given. What remains is to live it."

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 18, Moksa Sannyasa yoga, yoga of Liberation through Renunciation. This is a constant theme in our discussion that to enjoy something, you have to give up something. So all throughout Bhagavad Gita you heard these two words, Tyaga and Sannyasa. Our normal connotation is that if I give up something, I lost something. Upanishadhya and Bhagavad Gita constantly telling us, to gain something you have to give up something. You are giving up something because you want to gain something.\n\nWhen Upanishads like Isha Vasya, Upanishad says Isha vasyam idam sarvam kimcha Jagatyam jagat teyaktena that this world is pervaded by that one single entity. Everything in this world Jagatyam jagat. That which is you see in this Jagat is all pervaded by the same ishava same entity. Tena jakte na banjita. You protect that entity within you by detachment. If you attach to something else, you'll be detached from your own self.\n\nSo the main theme of Bhagavad Gita is that you should give up all attachments to enjoy the bliss which you're seeking. That perennial happiness that you're seeking is only can be enjoined by you giving up the attachments to the world of plurality. So we have been discussing these two terms from chapter two onward, which is Thyaga and sannyasa. So chapter opened with Arjunath saying I want to understand these two terms Tyaga and Sannyasa in detail. So there is no confusion. What is Tyaga and what is Sannyasa?\n\nWe have talked about the Tyaga, Sannyasa, same same. Giving up something and renouncing something. I give up my Sansar or I renounce my samsar. But last time as we discussed that giving up coffee is tyaga. I will not drink coffee from tomorrow. That doesn't mean that my attachment to coffee is gone.\n\nI Will have a lingering thought of a coffee. Renouncing is completely detaching yourself from the thought of coffee. So that's renunciation. So Bhagavan explains here in a very simple term. Sing the Kamyanam Karmanam Nyasah, Sanyasam Kabayo Vidhu. The sages who have realized the truth in their meditation and contemplation Then give out that truth in poetry.\n\nIn the richas, in Vedas they are called kavis. Those who have written poetry. These sages have said that Karmanam Nyasam it is sannyasam. Giving up the desire prompted actions is sannyas. You don't have to give up your clothes. You don't have to shave your head.\n\nYou don't have to run away from this world. Bhagavad said the giving up Karmanam Kamya Naam. But then what is tyaga? He says Sarvakarma Farad Tyagam Prahu Tyagam Vichakshanah. Wise people say that giving up the anxiety for the fruits of actions is tyaga. That I have given all my worries to the Karma Phala Datta.\n\nKarma Phala Datta is always somebody other than the one who is acting. I am always the actor in the present. I act, result comes in future is always in somebody else's hand, not in mine. If something which I don't have any control over to worry about it is seems silly. But we do that all the time. So Bhagavan said that one who has given up that anxiety of the fruits of actions is the tyagi.\n\nAnd then he said some people say that all actions are imperfect. There is not a perfect action in this world. Everything will have a main result and a side effect. Something which is good will always have some imperfection in it or something not good attached to it. And something which is evil will also some good attached to it. Climate change may be disastrous to one region.\n\nIt helps other region. I was watching one of those TV channel. Whatever that fish is migrating upward. So now there were less production in USA but more production in Canada. So what is lost for the USA is gain for the Canada. So there's always something which is contrary to what a popularly understood the result of the action is.\n\nSo Bhagawan said that some people say that therefore give up all actions because they are all imperfect. They will never give you perfect result. Your goal is to get the perfect happiness in life by working in this world. Even good actions will not Give you the perfect happiness. That's what we say in this class. Doing good is not good enough.\n\nThat still binds you to those good results. You feel good about doing something, you want to continue doing it. World doesn't let you do it and now you're mad. So some people say therefore give up all actions. But Bhagavan says no. My opinion is you should not give up Yajna Dana Tapaha Karma, not Yajyam.\n\nAnd then we have this confusion about what is Yajnadanand Thapa are for. I'm doing for others, I'm sacrificing well, I'm giving it to somebody else. I'm doing charity, I'm doing it for others. So this verse is clarified there for you. Nischayam Srunume Tatra Tyagay Bharatar Sabha, Tyagohi Purusha Vyagraha Trivedha Sampra Kirti Tah. Listen to me conclusively what Tyaga is.\n\nTyagahi Trividha Sampra Kirti Tah. Tyaga is also of three types. Two things are very common in our discussion in Bhagavad Gita. One is Tyaga and Renunciation. Second is Trigunas, satv, Rajas and Tamas. So Bhagawan said, let me tell you conclusively what Tyaga is.\n\nAnd also you should know that Tyaga is also of three types of it can be classified in the same way we have classified Ahara Yagna Tapa. All this in previous chapter Tag also can be classified in three. And Swamiji points out that Bhagavan addresses Arjuna as Purusha Vyagara, a tiger among men boosting his morale that you can do it. Yajna Dana Tapaha Karman Karyam Eva Tat Yagna Dana Tapahachayeva Pavanani Manishina. Here comes why Dana is for you and not for others. He said Yajna Dhana and Tapa Karma should not be given up Because Yajna Dana and Tapa are the purifier for wise is a translation even wise.\n\nBut actually there is no even word in Sanskrit here for the wise people. Also that continuing education, any profession that we are in, unless you're continuing education, you get stale. So when I was going for my eye surgery, when I subluxated eye lens, my cataract done four years ago, my lens has moved out. It's actually 90 degree. So obviously I didn't feel anything. But everybody who told me what it is pretty scary situation.\n\nSo I told my first surgeon that I think I want to go with somebody who has a lot of experience who look like me with gray hair. He said, no, no, no, Neil, don't do that. Because they are all stale, their knowledge is all outdated, you know, to go with somebody who's fresh, who has the latest knowledge. So I go to the next guy and ask him how many years of experience? How many surgeries you have done? I said, I'll go with the stale guy, the guy whose knowledge is 10 years old.\n\nSo I went with a guy who said I do it routinely for everybody, like six surgery in a month like this. So we also can say that a wise person also can veer off from his knowledge. He used to constantly be on his toes to keep his mind pure. So he said this will only help wise people who are constantly doing this to keep their knowledge pristine. If you're doing yajnadanand tapa and you have no intention of getting any benefit out of it for you, then obviously it's not going to be of any value. But it will help people who are wise enough to know the value of this.\n\nThat keeping my mind and intellect pure, I need to constantly be working on it because there are lots of temptations out there in this world. And when I'll sleep off from my wisdom, nobody will know. Therefore I have to be constantly be vigilant about to keeping my mind and intellect, which is my internal instrument pure so that the knowledge can shine through. So therefore he says, yajna dana tapaacha pavanani manishinam. So wise people, they constantly do yajna dana and tapa to keep their internal instrument pure. So he said, this is for you to keep yourself pure so that the knowledge will always be with you.\n\nEtan apitu karmani sangam tyaktva falanicha kartabyan ITI me partha nischitam matam uttamam. And now he says that I'm going to give you my final opinion. This is my best and final opinion. So there is no confusion. So up till now Bhagavan said, I'm not the first one to tell you. Many sages have come and told you that.\n\nNow I'm telling you same knowledge. Here he comes and tells Arjuna, this is my best and final opinion for you. Because he realized that Arjuna is probably at a point where he will listen to me more than Vedas and Upanishads. He said, I'm telling you itana pito carmani sangam tyaktva falanicha. Even these actions of yajna danan tapa should be done with sangam tyaktva by giving up attachment and falanicha and giving up fruits. So two things we constantly hear, you have to detach and you have to give up.\n\nDetach from that which is not real, that which is of not any use. So there are now lots of seminars on how to keep your house healthy and happy. And their claim is to give up everything which you don't use. Take out everything from your house which you have not used in last three years, last five years, keep it out and keep what you really need. And that will make you happy. So Bhagavan said, sangam tyaktva, detach from things which are of no value to you in this world.\n\nThe objects which cannot give you happiness. Be detached from that and fala nature and also detached from the expectations for the fruit. Because even doing good, when I have an expectation of something good coming out of, ties me to the anxiety. The Bhagavan said, yajna dana and tapa should be done for one simple reason. To purify your mind and intellect, your internal instrument. Because that's all you as a seeker has to do.\n\nRest of it Bhagavan has to do. It's like all you have to do is eat digestion. I don't have to worry about it. He needs to take care of it. Same way Bhagavan said, all you have to do is keep your mind and intellect pure. I'll take care of it.\n\nSo therefore it's a you do not worry about your actions. Give up the attachment to your actions. Whether I could do it or not, did I do it right or not? Let's not get attached to it. Do for purifying your mind and intellect without any attachment and any expectations from your actions. Even expectation this will purify my mind can become a burden.\n\nYou do for your simple motive of finding that ultimate happiness. Bhagawan says, rest, I will take care of it. Therefore he says, karthiya Bhyanidi, do all these actions as I prescribed. Partha nischitam matam uttam. This is my best and final opinion. Do actions which are purifying your mind.\n\nAnd that means which we consider the punya Karma. Papa, Karma are the ones which are giving negative impressions on our mind. They should be avoided anywhere. But the ones which I am doing it to earn punya even they should be done without attachment, without an expectation for the fruits. Bhagawan says that's my best and final opinion. We had been discussing chapter 18, Moksa Sanyasa Yoga.\n\nWe have seen the conclusion of Bhagavad Gidra. The last verse we had discussed is said Sarva Dharman parityajya Mamekam Sharanam Braja Ahamtwa Sarva Pape bhy moksha Shyamima Sucha. That's the conclusion. That's the essence of the entire Bhagavad Gita.",

Having done what you can, release the outcome.\n\nToday, identify one situation where you're holding on too tightly. Practice opening your hands.

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 18, Moksa Sannyasa yoga very title implies that liberation will only come from renunciation. In other words, something which we are holding on to is binding us. When whatever that is which is binding us, if we let go, we'll be released. And as we have discussed many times before, this is a summary of the entire Bhagavad Gita or Bhagavad Gita's teachings so far. And all throughout these chapters which we had been discussing, there is a one central theme that either is Sannyasa, renunciation or tyaga Abandonment is the key to this liberation. So the chapter opened with Arjuna's question of what is sannyasa and what is tyaga?\n\nAnd Krishna explained that Kamyanam Karmanam Nyasahiti Sannyasa giving up all the desire prompted act activity is Sannyasa and Sarvakarma Falathyagam Vidyaga giving up all the desire from the fruits of actions is tyaga. And then obviously Krishna took up the theme of tyaga as the most important thing because at our level sannyasa is probably not possible. Giving up all desire prompted activities is probably not possible at our level because everything we are doing right now is prompted by some desire. Even the things which I consider I'm doing as a community work or something, selfless activities. When you go to the root cause of why you're doing it, there is some desire which is prompting you to do that. There are people who are involved in a lot of organization which are community activity based.\n\nWe know they're very active as long as they have a position, a president or a chairperson or a board member or something. And suddenly he loses that position and the person disappears from that organization. All those were selfless activities. It was helping the community, it was helping the people who intended for it was not helping the person who was performing was not selfless for him. It was not directly benefiting him in terms of a monetary gain or any. There was something which was helping his ego and Bhagavan Constantly said tyaga is give up attachment to the fruits of actions.\n\nAnd therefore that is something which at our level we can understand and we can practice. So he takes up the theme of tyaga and says, there are philosophers who talks about that all actions should be given up. Because they say any action which you perform is binding to you with its results, whether it is good or bad. Good binds you to good results, bad binds you to bad result. When you're bound by the good results, you want it to be repeated over and over and over again. I want to be successful again and again and again.\n\nI go to a Las Vegas and the beginner's luck. First time I go to the, whatever they call it, the slot machine and win some money. So I think that's how it works. Next time also it should work the same way. So we get bound by this good result. And then sometimes we lose our shirt in Las Vegas and then want to avoid that.\n\nSo we are bound by the results. And therefore some philosophers, Bhagavan says, says all actions must be given up. You will never be bound by anything. But Bhagawan said, that's probably not possible for us anywhere. Therefore, he says, I recommend the second opinion which says yajna dana, tapah should not be given up. Yajna the offerings, dana the charity and tapas the discipline, austerities, which is what at our level we can relate to it as what we do as yajna is all our efforts in this life is a yajna.\n\nAll that we give back to this world as our results of our efforts is adana. And whatever we do to discipline ourselves is the tapas, Bhagwan said, that should not be given up. So the definitive advice from Krishna, as we have seen so far, he says, this is my best in the firm opinion that yajna dhana, tapa should not be given up. And then obviously he says, how to look at this tyagaha? So now our central theme of Bhagavad Gita as we have seen is Krishna's doctrine is the tyaga. And the tyaga defined is Sarva Karma, Falatyaga, Sarvakarma akhila.\n\nWithout living any actions, whether it is desire prompted or selfless. In both cases, do not be in anticipation of a particular result. Because as we have seen, even in doing the selfless actions, if we are bound to the Karma phala, then it is binding your ego. So Bhagavan said, perform this yajna dhana tapa but without attachment and without the expectation for the fruits of actions. Swamiji defines attachment as ego plus egocentric Desire is attachment. I have ines and minus, then I have a desire.\n\nSo when I come in contact with an object that can satisfy the desire, I'm attached. And I these days constantly talk about how we are attached to a grandchild. You know, because our ego says that's my grandchild. And also it is enchanting. Rather it's fulfilling, enchanting. So we are attached to.\n\nSo attachment is ego plus egocentric desire. And as long as that ego and egocentric desires are there, there will be an expectation for fruits of actions. So we are already worried. She is only 20 months old. We are worried what will happen when she grow up. Will she be smart enough to do all these things?\n\nWill she be doctor or an architect? Or will she be something else? Will be artistic or athletic? We're already looking at the results of our efforts in raising her up at overload. The Bhagavan says as long as these two are there, it will be a problem. So he said, perform all this yajnadana and tapa but without attachment in expectation for the results.\n\nSo now I think I'm doing the tyaga. I'm giving up some things and then feel good about it that I gave up this thing. Let's see what kind of tyaga is that. So the next three verses says Niyatasyatu sanyasah Karmano na upopady. What should not be given up? He said obligatory duty.\n\nThose which are the Niyata Karmas should never be given up. So we have learnt in the previous chapter there are three types of karmas. Something which you do daily. You are not obliging anybody by doing so. Then Niyata Karma, obligatory duties. I'm a. I'm a doctor, I'm an architect.\n\nI'm a father, I'm an employer. All those roles which I'm playing, it comes with its own duties. They are Niyata Karma. Those are my Niyata Karmas. I have to fulfill their duties. Then Naymithya Karma are special duties, special occasion, special situations.\n\nThese days, at least once in a while I find time from my routine and go and see Dan in the hospital. Well, that was not in my routine before. Neither what is required that I go to MCV before Dan was admitted there. It's now a special conditions which created duty for me. So then Namittya Karma Bhagavan says none of this should be given up. Is not recommended that you give up your obligatory duties Muha Tasha Parityagaha Tama Saha Pari Kirti Taha I have given up all these duties Niyata Karma I'm a father but I don't want to take care of my family.\n\nI think it is binding me to the I'm going to get because I'm confused whether I'm supposed to be doing or not. Bhagavan says that tamasik Tyaga it is Tyaga. You have given up something but say tamasic out of delusion out of my ignorance that this is my duty if I give up something because now it gives me bliss in my ignorance I don't file my taxes for five years. Nobody finds out and I'm at complete bliss. I didn't pay any taxes. It's a Tama Sikhtyag I did do not go for voting.\n\nThis is Tama Sikhtyag out of delusion that it is not my duty. I did not know that are you to file taxes? Well I didn't file it. I did not know that my vote counts so I didn't vote for it. Bhagavan says that's a Tama Sikhtyaga so do all your obligated duties. Bhagavan said without a attachment and results I'm going to vote for Democratic candidate.\n\nSo first thing Bhagawan said is if I give up something because of my ignorance my delusion that this is my duty it's not a tiag which is going to give me any good benefits or any more liberation. It actually binds me more to the ignorance and its consequences. Ignorance of law is not an excuse. When I came from Africa. Very first week when you start driving you're driving on a right side or left side. Your brain is not wired yet so you end up going in the wrong sense.\n\nLuckily there was no more traffic. I said I'm sorry sir but I did not know that's not an excuse my friend. You're going to get killed if you drive on the wrong side. So bear in mind that we drive on the right side not on the wrong side. Bhagavan said that's a Tamasik tyaga. I give up my duties out of delusion or ignorance Is Tamasik Dukkham Itiyevayat Karma Kayakya Bhayat I need to do this.\n\nBut it is too hard when it snows and there is a foot of snow in my front door. I have to keep my office entrance clear. So when the people come to my office, they don't fall. But it's too hard and there's nobody else to help me. The Kamiti vyat Karma Kayakle sa Bhayatya Jayat. Because of the fear of the pain to this body, I give up that action.\n\nBhagavan says sakrutva rajasam tyaga. That's the Raja Sikhtyaga. I'm giving up something I am not doing something which I should have done. I clearly know that's my duty. To keep the entrance to my house and office clean is my duty so that nobody else can get hurt by coming to my home or my office. But out of that fear that it's going to hurt my body or hurt me something, I avoid doing it.\n\nBhagavan, it is certainly tyaga but it is a rajasik tyaga because it creates agitation in my mind. Things sometimes when you don't do gives you more agitation than you do. My standard example is calling my mother. My mother expects me to call every week. But I end up calling every couple of months. And then what happens is when I don't call her and as the time goes by I start feeling guilty.\n\nBut I don't get around calling her. It makes me feel even more guilty. It's still I do it that day. You know, I at least called today. I talked to her for five minutes. Okay, now I'm good for a week.\n\nWell, the week passes by. Second week, third week and I then start feeling guilty again. So this dagger of not doing my duty because it's going to disrupt something I'm doing here because of the time change. Obviously we have to either call her or call her in the morning or in the evening, late night. And then that's within my clashing, my routine. And I give up that so that it does not disturb my routine.\n\nNow it gives me pleasure. Sakrutva rajasam tyagam naivat yaga Phalam labhed. There is no benefit I'm getting out of not doing that action. So it did not benefit me at all of saving that time for not calling. It actually gave me more troubles and more agitations. Had I taken those five minutes to call her, it would have given me peace.\n\nFor next five days at least. So Bhagawan said that if you're giving up something by fear of it's going to hurt you, it's going to discomfort you, it's going to disrupt your activities.",

Having done what you can, release the outcome.\n\nToday, identify one situation where you're holding on too tightly. Practice opening your hands.

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 18, Moksas and Nyasa Yoga. Yoga of Liberation through Renunciation. We are at the end of Bhagavad Gita. We have discussed 17 chapters. This is like a work plan we are making for ourselves. What is work strategy?\n\nWork strategy is capabilities plus opportunity is work strategy. So you've seen our capabilities in chapter two, that this self is indestructible, only the body is destructible. And then we have seen what are our opportunities. If we can align with that supreme self versus right now that I'm identified with this limited being called Ego, this body, mind and intellect, then I have a chance to achieve my goal of a perennial happiness, unlimited happiness. Right now because I am identified with this limited self, my happiness is also limited. There are limited capabilities, limited opportunities, therefore limited outcome.\n\nBut I do have an opportunity to align myself with the unlimited self, the unconditioned self. Then my opportunities will be unlimited. Therefore I will have the unlimited happiness. That's what we have learned so far in Bhagavad Gita. Now we are making a work plan. So right from the beginning of this chapter we have seen that Arjuna asked question about what is renunciation Tyaga.\n\nFrom the overall discourse we have come to the conclusion that the only way to achieve the then Moksha, the liberation is by giving up things, not acquiring things by Tyaga and Sannyasa only. So Arjuna wanted to know what is the difference between the Tyaga and Sannyasa? And Bhagavan made it very clear in a very simple term that Karma Phala Tyaga is Tyaga. When I have no desire for particular result from my action, that's Dhyaga. And when I have no sense of agency, I have no desire for desire prompted actions, that's Sannyasa. When I give up the desire prompted action, it's Sannyasa.\n\nAnd then it seemed like the Bhagawan is veering off on off tangent on discussion about actions. It seemed like we started the discourse on the Sannyasanthyaga. But now we are talking about action. So in last three verses we have discussed, we talked about what constitute actions. See, there are five constituent part of any action, Adhishtana Karta. Then the organs of actions and all the functions of all my organs of actions and perception.\n\nAnd then the presiding deity, the five elemental forces. These five has to come together for any action to come into existence. So if any one of them is missing, the action will not take place. So if the body is not there, there won't be any action. If ego is not there, there will not be any action also. So we have learned that action requires the five constituent parts.\n\nAnd now we'll be talking about what is the anatomy of action. So the question is why Bhagavan is moving from discussion on sannyas and tyaga into actions. If you remember, then chapter four. After learning Sankhya Yoga and after learning Karma Yoga, we talked of Gnana Karma Sannyasa Yoga. This sannyasa from the actions is only possible by knowledge about who is the actor, who is the doer. Right now the sannyas is not possible for me as long as I'm identified with the doer.\n\nIf I think I am the doer, giving up action is not possible. Should I give up all the actions? As it seems that action is the root cause of all my problems. Action may be appropriate, inappropriate. It gives either a good, bad or somewhere in between result. Why not I get out of completely and say, well let me not act and therefore there wouldn't be any consequences.\n\nBy very nature that we are living entities, it's not possible. We have learned that in previous chapters and in this chapter there is not even for a moment that we can stay without action. Nahi Kastchat Kshanama PI Jatu Tishtadhya Karma Krut. The signature of life is action. So as long as I'm alive, I'll be acting. So giving up action is not the solution.\n\nThen what is the solution? The solution is to renounce actions in knowledge. If I take ownership of my actions, then I'm bound by my actions. It is more like filing bankruptcy. If I have a company and I have taken ownership of the company and I have did everything what is supposed to be done and I end up with a huge debt. What is my out from there?\n\nThe American law says the only way you can get out of it, file for chapter 11. First you file for chapter 11. Say let me reorganize myself. So everything I have done right now is null and void. Nobody can come, no creditor come and ask for anything for me. And if that doesn't work out, I can reconstitute myself.\n\nI file for a complete bank. At that point, I disown everything that I owned in that company. I'm no more responsible for the functioning of the company nor for the assets. I'm not the owner of the assets and I'm also not responsible for the debt. Now I'm completely free and clear from that. Therefore, we have the limited liability companies.\n\nWe want to compartmentalize our responsibility. So Bhagavan said, you can do this. You can file for bankruptcy in your actions. If you disown your actions, if you say I am not the doer then you are not responsible for any of our actions. If I realize that I am not the doer, I, which I consider I right now is actually the conditioned self, the conditioned ego that is identified with this body, mind and intellectual. And therefore I'm responsible for it.\n\nWell, if you're a doer, then as you have learned, out of the five constituent parts of the action, one is the Karta, the doer. That doer is as much involved in the action as the other four. So Bhagavan said, the only way to get out of it is to realize who the actor is. Which is what the Gnanakanama Sanya. I as an I without any superimposition on it. Superimposition is I am an architect.\n\nWell, that's a superimposition on I. I am a father, another superimposition. I am a brother, another superimposition. If I remove all the superimpositions and what remains is I is that I really is a doer. That is the I I'm concerned about wants to be happy. So Bhagavan said that we need to understand what constitute actions. Then also now we have to understand where our misunderstanding is.\n\nSo from these previous verses we have concluded this action belongs to Prakriti, the manifest world. We also Learned in chapter 13. Prakruti is cause for the Karya and Karan action and the cause of actions. But Purusa, Sukhadu Khana Boktrutvi Hetuhu ucha de. But Purusa is the enjoyer of Sukha Dukha Prakriti. My nature in the nature of the world of objects creates this action.\n\nBecause I have a vasana for singing, I go to music concert. So this is the interaction between the world of objects and my vasanas. They are all part of this Prakriti. But I, the self is not really involved in it. I as an I has no vasanas, no conditioning. And therefore it's not in war.\n\nIf I fail to recognize, Bhagavan said, then you are the doer. As an ego, you're fully involved and vested in that and you will bear the results of it. Tatra evam sati kartaram tmanam kevalam Tu yaha pashati akrut buddhihe. Whose Buddhi is not trained in thinking finer points about what is right and what is wrong, what is reality and what is non reality. Sa pasyati durma tehi. Such a person's mind is perverted.\n\nPerverted in essence is not seeing the reality as it is and getting affected by the wrong notion of what reality is. Dhurma tehi akrad buddhi. Why these words are used? Because he says, because you are seeing. Tatyaam siddhi kartaram atmanam kevalam to yahu consider atma itself to the doer. One who sees that atma is the doer, he's wrong.\n\nBecause he does not have the finer intellect to realize what is right and wrong. Also he is influenced by wrong mati. His mind is tilted, polluted by vasanas, his intellect is clouded and therefore he does not do who the doer is. Because we elaborately analyzed and came to the conclusion that the action is only taking place in the realm of the Prakriti and the Purusha is not involved at all. The universal Purusha is not involved. We have used this example over and over again.\n\nThe space in this room is not participating in any activity of this room. But because we are identifying it with the walls, floor and ceiling, it becomes a room space. Now it is all the qualities of this room. Height, length, breadth, air polluted in it, clean in it, light there, darkness. All that is associated with this room is actually the conditioning superimposed in the space which was always here, is here and will always remain here. When you remove this building, the space will go back to its original condition.\n\nBut it was unpolluted, pristine space. That space is not taking part in any of the activity of this room. The same way the self in me which enables me to do all these activities when it is seen as unconditioned, is not taking any part in. But it seems it's taking part. Because I'm identifying it with my mind, my intellect and my body. Now I'm thinking That I, the conditioned self is the only self and he's the doer bhagwant.\n\nThat notion is wrong and therefore we are suffering. So this verse clearly says you need to differentiate between who is the doer and who are you. Are you the conditioned self, the ego? Or you are the unconditioned self, that which is imperishable, indestructible. Yasya na aham kruta bhavah buddhi Yasya na lipya de hatwh iman lokan hanti na ni badyade. So we are coming back to what we want to know.\n\nHow should I act in this life? He said, you act as you have to. Because once you understand that yasya naham kuta bhavaha once you realize that I, the self is not the doer, not taking any part in action, I'm just a saxichaitanya. I'm just the enabler. Welfare check comes to the person who is receiving welfare. That check will enable that person to go and buy whatever necessities he has.\n\nWhat he buys is entirely up to that person. We have heard complaints about people on welfare. Use the welfare checks to go and buy beer or whatever, the alcohol versus buying food. But because that is according to him, welfare department only sends you a check, enables you to buy things in your grocery store. After that, it is entirely up to you how you use that. This life in me is enabling me to act.\n\nBut it's not taking part into what field I'm acting in. That comes from my vasanas, my mental makeup, my intellect capabilities in my body. That's how I find my field. So Bhagavan said, yasya na aham kruta bhavah. One with his finer intellect came to the conclusion that I am not the doer. Such a person Buddhi Yasyana Lipyate whose intellect is not clouded by all the experiences of my life.\n\nSo right now my Buddhi is clouded by what I experienced. Before pressing on my mind. That impression created what the reality is. So next time when I encounter the similar situation, I'll use that as a reference point and then act accordingly. Some people who start investing in one field get successful in first venture. He continues to do that and he has more positive attitude.\n\nNext guy who does the same thing but fails the very first time, he'll have a negative impression of what to do in that field.",

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 18, Moksas and Nyasa Yoga. Yoga of Liberation through Renunciation. We are at the end of Bhagavad Gita. We have discussed 17 chapters. This is like a work plan we are making for ourselves. What is work strategy?\n\nWork strategy is capabilities plus opportunity is work strategy. So you've seen our capabilities in chapter two, that this self is indestructible, only the body is destructible. And then we have seen what are our opportunities. If we can align with that supreme self versus right now that I'm identified with this limited being called Ego, this body, mind and intellect, then I have a chance to achieve my goal of a perennial happiness, unlimited happiness. Right now because I am identified with this limited self, my happiness is also limited. There are limited capabilities, limited opportunities, therefore limited outcome.\n\nBut I do have an opportunity to align myself with the unlimited self, the unconditioned self. Then my opportunities will be unlimited. Therefore I will have the unlimited happiness. That's what we have learned so far in Bhagavad Gita. Now we are making a work plan. So right from the beginning of this chapter we have seen that Arjuna asked question about what is renunciation Tyaga.\n\nFrom the overall discourse we have come to the conclusion that the only way to achieve the then Moksha, the liberation is by giving up things, not acquiring things by Tyaga and Sannyasa only. So Arjuna wanted to know what is the difference between the Tyaga and Sannyasa? And Bhagavan made it very clear in a very simple term that Karma Phala Tyaga is Tyaga. When I have no desire for particular result from my action, that's Dhyaga. And when I have no sense of agency, I have no desire for desire prompted actions, that's Sannyasa. When I give up the desire prompted action, it's Sannyasa.\n\nAnd then it seemed like the Bhagawan is veering off on off tangent on discussion about actions. It seemed like we started the discourse on the Sannyasanthyaga. But now we are talking about action. So in last three verses we have discussed, we talked about what constitute actions. See, there are five constituent part of any action, Adhishtana Karta. Then the organs of actions and all the functions of all my organs of actions and perception.\n\nAnd then the presiding deity, the five elemental forces. These five has to come together for any action to come into existence. So if any one of them is missing, the action will not take place. So if the body is not there, there won't be any action. If ego is not there, there will not be any action also. So we have learned that action requires the five constituent parts.\n\nAnd now we'll be talking about what is the anatomy of action. So the question is why Bhagavan is moving from discussion on sannyas and tyaga into actions. If you remember, then chapter four. After learning Sankhya Yoga and after learning Karma Yoga, we talked of Gnana Karma Sannyasa Yoga. This sannyasa from the actions is only possible by knowledge about who is the actor, who is the doer. Right now the sannyas is not possible for me as long as I'm identified with the doer.\n\nIf I think I am the doer, giving up action is not possible. Should I give up all the actions? As it seems that action is the root cause of all my problems. Action may be appropriate, inappropriate. It gives either a good, bad or somewhere in between result. Why not I get out of completely and say, well let me not act and therefore there wouldn't be any consequences.\n\nBy very nature that we are living entities, it's not possible. We have learned that in previous chapters and in this chapter there is not even for a moment that we can stay without action. Nahi Kastchat Kshanama PI Jatu Tishtadhya Karma Krut. The signature of life is action. So as long as I'm alive, I'll be acting. So giving up action is not the solution.\n\nThen what is the solution? The solution is to renounce actions in knowledge. If I take ownership of my actions, then I'm bound by my actions. It is more like filing bankruptcy. If I have a company and I have taken ownership of the company and I have did everything what is supposed to be done and I end up with a huge debt. What is my out from there?\n\nThe American law says the only way you can get out of it, file for chapter 11. First you file for chapter 11. Say let me reorganize myself. So everything I have done right now is null and void. Nobody can come, no creditor come and ask for anything for me. And if that doesn't work out, I can reconstitute myself.\n\nI file for a complete bank. At that point, I disown everything that I owned in that company. I'm no more responsible for the functioning of the company nor for the assets. I'm not the owner of the assets and I'm also not responsible for the debt. Now I'm completely free and clear from that. Therefore, we have the limited liability companies.\n\nWe want to compartmentalize our responsibility. So Bhagavan said, you can do this. You can file for bankruptcy in your actions. If you disown your actions, if you say I am not the doer then you are not responsible for any of our actions. If I realize that I am not the doer, I, which I consider I right now is actually the conditioned self, the conditioned ego that is identified with this body, mind and intellectual. And therefore I'm responsible for it.\n\nWell, if you're a doer, then as you have learned, out of the five constituent parts of the action, one is the Karta, the doer. That doer is as much involved in the action as the other four. So Bhagavan said, the only way to get out of it is to realize who the actor is. Which is what the Gnanakanama Sanya. I as an I without any superimposition on it. Superimposition is I am an architect.\n\nWell, that's a superimposition on I. I am a father, another superimposition. I am a brother, another superimposition. If I remove all the superimpositions and what remains is I is that I really is a doer. That is the I I'm concerned about wants to be happy. So Bhagavan said that we need to understand what constitute actions. Then also now we have to understand where our misunderstanding is.\n\nSo from these previous verses we have concluded this action belongs to Prakriti, the manifest world. We also Learned in chapter 13. Prakruti is cause for the Karya and Karan action and the cause of actions. But Purusa, Sukhadu Khana Boktrutvi Hetuhu ucha de. But Purusa is the enjoyer of Sukha Dukha Prakriti. My nature in the nature of the world of objects creates this action.\n\nBecause I have a vasana for singing, I go to music concert. So this is the interaction between the world of objects and my vasanas. They are all part of this Prakriti. But I, the self is not really involved in it. I as an I has no vasanas, no conditioning. And therefore it's not in war.\n\nIf I fail to recognize, Bhagavan said, then you are the doer. As an ego, you're fully involved and vested in that and you will bear the results of it. Tatra evam sati kartaram tmanam kevalam Tu yaha pashati akrut buddhihe. Whose Buddhi is not trained in thinking finer points about what is right and what is wrong, what is reality and what is non reality. Sa pasyati durma tehi. Such a person's mind is perverted.\n\nPerverted in essence is not seeing the reality as it is and getting affected by the wrong notion of what reality is. Dhurma tehi akrad buddhi. Why these words are used? Because he says, because you are seeing. Tatyaam siddhi kartaram atmanam kevalam to yahu consider atma itself to the doer. One who sees that atma is the doer, he's wrong.\n\nBecause he does not have the finer intellect to realize what is right and wrong. Also he is influenced by wrong mati. His mind is tilted, polluted by vasanas, his intellect is clouded and therefore he does not do who the doer is. Because we elaborately analyzed and came to the conclusion that the action is only taking place in the realm of the Prakriti and the Purusha is not involved at all. The universal Purusha is not involved. We have used this example over and over again.\n\nThe space in this room is not participating in any activity of this room. But because we are identifying it with the walls, floor and ceiling, it becomes a room space. Now it is all the qualities of this room. Height, length, breadth, air polluted in it, clean in it, light there, darkness. All that is associated with this room is actually the conditioning superimposed in the space which was always here, is here and will always remain here. When you remove this building, the space will go back to its original condition.\n\nBut it was unpolluted, pristine space. That space is not taking part in any of the activity of this room. The same way the self in me which enables me to do all these activities when it is seen as unconditioned, is not taking any part in. But it seems it's taking part. Because I'm identifying it with my mind, my intellect and my body. Now I'm thinking That I, the conditioned self is the only self and he's the doer bhagwant.\n\nThat notion is wrong and therefore we are suffering. So this verse clearly says you need to differentiate between who is the doer and who are you. Are you the conditioned self, the ego? Or you are the unconditioned self, that which is imperishable, indestructible. Yasya na aham kruta bhavah buddhi Yasya na lipya de hatwh iman lokan hanti na ni badyade. So we are coming back to what we want to know.\n\nHow should I act in this life? He said, you act as you have to. Because once you understand that yasya naham kuta bhavaha once you realize that I, the self is not the doer, not taking any part in action, I'm just a saxichaitanya. I'm just the enabler. Welfare check comes to the person who is receiving welfare. That check will enable that person to go and buy whatever necessities he has.\n\nWhat he buys is entirely up to that person. We have heard complaints about people on welfare. Use the welfare checks to go and buy beer or whatever, the alcohol versus buying food. But because that is according to him, welfare department only sends you a check, enables you to buy things in your grocery store. After that, it is entirely up to you how you use that. This life in me is enabling me to act.\n\nBut it's not taking part into what field I'm acting in. That comes from my vasanas, my mental makeup, my intellect capabilities in my body. That's how I find my field. So Bhagavan said, yasya na aham kruta bhavah. One with his finer intellect came to the conclusion that I am not the doer. Such a person Buddhi Yasyana Lipyate whose intellect is not clouded by all the experiences of my life.\n\nSo right now my Buddhi is clouded by what I experienced. Before pressing on my mind. That impression created what the reality is. So next time when I encounter the similar situation, I'll use that as a reference point and then act accordingly. Some people who start investing in one field get successful in first venture. He continues to do that and he has more positive attitude.\n\nNext guy who does the same thing but fails the very first time, he'll have a negative impression of what to do in that field.",
      "reflection": "The Gita's final teaching is surrender. Not passive resignation, but active trust. Having done what you can, release the outcome.\n\nToday, identify one situation where you're holding on too tightly. Practice opening your hands. Let it be what it will be.\n\nArjuna's journey from paralysis to clarity, from confusion to conviction, is available to each of us. The teaching has been given. What remains is to live it."

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 18, moonkanish Sannyasa yoga Yoga of Liberation through Renunciation. So, as we have discussed before, the whole exercise in Bhagavad Gita is to renounce actions in knowledge. We have figured out that the actions are the cause for all my frictions and unhappiness in life. Any action which I perform, whether good, bad or ugly, will have its result. And the result will be either conducive, not conducive, or somewhere in between, mixed. And in this chapter, Bhagawan clarifies that that only applies to a Tyagi, one who has not given up expectation for the fruits.\n\nIn this chapter we'll learn the definition of a Tyagi. One who gives up the Karma Fala Tyaga is a Tyagi. The one who gives up all the desire prompted actions is a Sannyasi. I can only give up all my desire prompted actions if I have no desires. At this point, it does not seem that I can reach that point where I hold no desire. So then the exercise is how can I solve this conundrum?\n\nOne hand it says the only way you can be free if you have no desires. On the other hand, it clearly seems that living without desires is not possible. It does seem like there is something we are missing out in this equation. That if both are possible then there got to be some kind of a parallax which I have to remove so I can see the truth as it is. And it is something which we have learnt in Vedanta. That same thing can be seen in two different lights.\n\nA rope can be seen as a rope if I'm clear what it is. But it also can give a rise to fear that it's a snake. So the same thing, depending on my mental association, I can create the rope or I can create a snake. Similarly, it seems like because I can't reconcile these two, on one hand Gita keeps telling me to leave without any desires and other hand I see that the desires are unavoidable. It seems like that there are two different People who can achieve this. One who cannot live without desires and one who has no desires.\n\nSo to understand that, we have obviously taken this study of Bhagavad Gita. And now we are coming to the conclusion that there are two I. The one I is a conditioned I which is conditioned by my body, my mind, my intellect, associated with my body, my mind, intellect and therefore that I has all the limitations of my body, my mind and intellect. But then there is one I which is always there. No matter whatever the condition of this body, mind, intellectual, body was a baby, then it was a child and then it was a young man and then it was the adult and now it's the old man that I remained the same. So there must be a differentiation between the I which I consider I when I think about my body, my mind, my intellect and that which has no conditioning.\n\nWhen I remove all the conditioning when I will not be there as this conditioned eye that I will still remain as we learnt in Bhagavad Gita chapter 2, that I is indestructible and the metaphor we use all the time in the room space. Room space is conditioned by its limitations of the size and shape and the type of air in it. Right now once this walls, floor and ceilings are gone the space will remain what it is. So we have learnt in chapter 13 that there is a field and it's knower. As long as there is field, I as the knower will limit myself as the knower of the field. So in this chapter we have started our journey by saying let me define what is Tyagi and what is Sannyasi.\n\nIt does not give up the Karmaphalas. Because Karmaphalas are not in his hand. Karma Phala is something Karma Phala Datta. Someone other than me gives me the fruits of my actions. But I want to influence that outcome by my desires. That I want this particular outcome.\n\nThat if I give up influencing the outcome by my desires then I will be Karma Falathyagi. If you know this, then the next thing you need to know is that any kind of results which come from your actions are not binding to you. Because you did not expect any result out of it. Whatever comes you accept with the Prasad Buddhi. Just like when you go to the temple and you accept Prasad, you don't really are choosy about what comes in your prasad. Whatever Panditja gives you, accept it with love.\n\nWhen whatever comes out of my actions is the result, I should accept that. Just as I accept Prasad from Bhagavan. If I develop this Sense Bhagavan said that you will be tyagi once you disassociate this limited I, you will not have desires. That I will not have desires. The smaller I will have desires. The body will have its own demands, mind will have its own demands and intellect will own demands.\n\nFor one who is overseeing the three will have no demands whatsoever. It is now up to me to identify either with the lower eye or the higher eye. So we have learned from the beginning that giving up actions is not possible. Therefore, whatever action you perform should be ordained action. Those even when I am performing, I should be not attached. It should be performed without any Ra, without any asakti, without any expectation and any attachment.\n\nI should be performing this action. That's the advice we've heard so far. Then Bhagavan got into the discussion of what is action. Because we need to understand what is action. So we understood that action has five components. Unless those five come together, action never takes place.\n\nSo in this five component, one is Karta is the actor. You have to have an actor or an action to come into being. And that's the only one I have control over. Then I need to now define who the Karta is. And that once I figure out, then I will be able to figure out whether I am the sufferer, the enjoyer of my actions or not. Because the Karta is the Bhokta of all the actions.\n\nSo in the following _Verses_ we have seen that one who considers that this self is the doer, he does not see the truth alone. Because the truth is the self is not acting at all. In all these actions which I am performing, the self remains as just a witness. Because actions are performed by the gunas of my body, mind and intellect. The nature of my mind, nature of my intellect and nature of my body decide what type of actions I'll perform. When the conducive objects come in my way, I get tempted to act and then I act.\n\nGnanam, gneam, parignata, Trivedaha, Karma, Chodana. These are the propellers of my actions. Gnanam, knowledge, Gnayam the knowable and Pariganatha the knower. So this is basically going back to chapter 13. In chapter 13 we are seeing there is a field and its knower. So when this gnanam, when there is a knowledge of the field occurs, that's the knowledge.\n\nOnce I figure out this is the field of my activity, may I identify the field of my activity. Then the knower comes into being. As long as I'm aware of the field, I become the knower of the field. So this three when the knower of the field identifies the field and when that knowledge takes place the gnanam that becomes the propeller of my action. Starbucks is the field of my knowledge. Passing by I identify Starbucks.\n\nA field of knowledge is there and my knowledge has taken place. The Starbucks is there. I as the knower of the field will have the desire to have a cup of coffee. That knowledge of the field by the knower is the propeller of action. As long as I'm identified as the knower of the field constantly associating with the field that knowledge will create the impulse in me to act in this world. So that's clearly Bhagawan said you should understand that the knower of the field minus the field is just the knower.\n\nKnowledge of the field minus the field is just the knowledge. So that knowledge is I exist in my deep sleep. I have no other knowledge but I still know that I exist. So when I wake up and somebody asks what kind of sleep? You say I had a very nice sleep. I said I don't know, I just had a good sleep.\n\nThere is no other experience but just I exist in the experience. The Babawan said know how these actions work. When the field comes in contact with the knower of the field when knowledge takes place that knowledge will be the propeller of your action. And then he says Karanam Karma Karta ITI Trivedha Karma Sangrah what will preserve the action? Three things to come together. Karanamdhi instrument of action.\n\nI see a nice house in a good neighborhood. I really want to buy this house. But then I figure out do I have the means to buy the house? If I don't have the means, all that good idea about that house and my desire to buy that house remains just a dream and a desire. I will put that into action. If I have the means to perform that action that is Karanam.\n\nWhen the Karana When I have the means, the equipment to perform this action and Karta then the doer. If there is no doer I will have all the means and I have all the desires But I am not available to perform that action then also that action won't come into existence. So these two has to come together. The Karanam and Karta has to come together to karma to take place. We are analyzing what is the impulse of the action or how the action come into being. Because at the end of this discussion we're going to find out what control I have on my action.\n\nWe are coming to the conclusion that the person that I really have control over is the Kartha. If I don't have that doership Bhav that notion that I am the doer then no action really takes place. So that I, which we call it the conditioned I Jivatma is thinking that he is the doer. Not only is thinking he is the doer, he is the only doer. When I perform any action and it is successful I feel that I did it and I did it all by myself. There was no help from anybody else.\n\nThis is where Bhagavan says you are going wrong. That you think you are the doer and you are the only doer. If I think that I have the control over my actions and I perform my actions then obviously I have a particular result in mind. Because I think I'm performing it correctly. I'm performing right field. The result must be X, Y or Z.\n\nWe forget that for any action I have to perform the field of action has to be appropriately configured to drive from my home to here. The whole field of action which is my road from my house to here has to be completely clear. All traffic lights have to work perfectly. All other drivers should drive in the proper lanes. Unless all that come in property configuration I wouldn't be able to come here in time. So when I consider that I did everything myself to come here in time, I'm actually wrong.\n\nThere are so many people have to do so many things for me to be here on time.",

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 18, moonkanish gmail Yoga, Yoga of Liberation through Renunciation. So obviously we had been discussing that this renunciation is of the actions which we are performing. Renouncing the actions will liberate me. And then we have also seen that all actions cannot be renounced. Therefore, the actions which are helping me in purifying my internal instrument, the Ch _Verses_, those actions must be performed. And Bhagavan said, even for the wise people, one who has achieved this knowledge, even if they stop performing these actions, there is the danger of getting pollution on their mind and intellect or getting again tamas going over the mind and intellect.\n\nSo they also continue. It's like a continuous maintenance. You have to continue to act in the manner which purifies our internal instrument, Ch _Verses_. Your actions should be for the purpose of Ch _Verses_, for the purpose of purifying mind and intellect. So remains in a sattvic clean mode where you can see the reality as is all the time. And those actions we have seen moonkanish gmail Ch, those actions must be performed in a right attitude and a right manner.\n\nThen we have also discussed that actions are prompted by the knowledge I know something which either I like or dislike or come to the conclusion that that's the field of my action. So the knowledge is the propeller of action. So we have seen _Verses_ moonkanish gmail, the knowledge, the knower and that to be known are the three propellers of action that propel you to act in this world. So the last three verses which you have seen analyzed the knowledge that even knowledge can be of three different types. Like everything else that we have discussed in Bhagavad Gita in Vedanta, that things can be classified broadly into three categories of _Verses_, Ch and Ch. Because these are the qualities of Maya.\n\nThis world is nothing but the projection through Maya. So everything in this world can be classified into these three categories. The knowledge also can be of _Verses_ type, a Ch type or a Ch type. Recent _Verses_ knowledge is the one which makes me see the unity in diversity is the _Verses_ type that I can see the same immutable reality pulsating through all beings and things. That knowledge which makes me see that is the sattvic knowledge, the pure knowledge, the knowledge which makes me see the plurality that this world is made up of innumerable various things and beings unrelated to each other is called a gmail type because they divides my world into I and the world. I am separate in this world.\n\nAnd this world is also not a one entity but conglomeration of various beings and things. That's a gmail knowledge. And that creates again another division of world which I like and which I do not like. So this knowledge is the gmail type. And then the third we have seen is Ch knowledge, which a very narrow focus on a view or a philosophy or an entity may say, this is reality. Or in Sanskrit we say kupamanduk, like the frog in a well.\n\nFor that frog, the well is the world. There is nothing beyond that. Obviously we know that is because the frog's ignorance about the rest of the world. The same way, if we hold a view that this is real and everything else which other people tell me or other people have, the view are wrong, then it's a Ch knowledge. It's out of delusion, out of confusion, it's out of my ignorance that I hold that view. That's a Ch knowledge.\n\nAnd Bhagwan said why it is important for us to know what type of knowledge we have. Because my actions will be guided by those views which I have because of my knowledge. We have seen the example that because I have a complete sattvic knowledge about my own self, when it comes to my body, the actions are completely synchronized. That when there is a pain in our leg, my hand and arm rush there to help that. That's because the knowledge is purely sattvic about myself that I pervade through this entire body. There is a unity in this diversity of limbs I have in my body.\n\nAnd therefore my actions are also sattvic. There is no permission to be granted to the hand to go and massage the leg, which is if I have the similar reason for the rest of the world, my action will be exactly like that. So the next three verses says the actions are also now can be classified depending on what propelled those actions into Sattvik. Rajasika tamashak niyatam sangarahitam _Verses_ moonkanish. That action which is done with the attitudes and niyatam, it needs to be done and therefore I'm doing it. My hand does not ask permission because it needs to be done.\n\nIf I will have the same view, if there's any pain anywhere, I just won't be able to stop myself to go and help. But right now I divide my world. Well, that's all happening in Egypt, so it's not my problem. We are fine here in moonkanish. Let me call my brothers and sisters in India. Well, they are doing fine.\n\nSo I think we are okay. Because I don't feel that connection, that unity with the people who are suffering or people who need help. The Bhagwan said, one who does this action, the action which is done in the gmail is ordained. Ch There is no attachment. _Verses_ moonkanish gmail. There is no likes or dislike.\n\nThere is no particular attachment in the left leg versus right leg. Even though my right leg is probably broken and needs more care. But I see them completely unattached manner. My actions are ordained. In a sense, I feel compelled to act by my nature and my instinct because of the oneness I feel with that entity. Without any attachment, there is no particular reason that I want to help that person or want to do that action.\n\nIt just needs to be done. I don't have a particular love for that action or hate for their action. And there is no expectation of a particular result to come out. Such an action is considered satwik. That's because it will create the bliss internally for me in my internal instrument. Once I perform that action, there is no agitation.\n\nThere is no lingering thought, why did I do it? Was that the right thing to do or not? There is no after effect of my action and therefore it is sattvic. So there is a bliss inside. As Bhagavan said, the harmony outside the field in which I'm acting, there is also no agitation. Because I read something, the people I'm working with, there is no agitation with them.\n\nThey also feel harmony. And we know that when we are on some kind of a community, actions where you really don't have anything to gain but just to help out, you feel harmony there. And then other actions, you don't feel harmony. And that's because they fall into the next category. We say the _Verses_ moonkanish gmail Ch _Verses_ moonkanish gmail Ch _Verses_ moonkanish tad Ch _Verses_. Most of our actions unfortunately fall into this category.\n\nFirst of all, it's a moonkanish gmail. It's done because it's prompted by my desire. I want to get something out of it, therefore I'm doing it. Their desire prompted action. I want to gain something out of it. Why did you join this organization, moonkanish?\n\nWell, it's a good networking there. It's a Rotary Club supposed to be or a Lions Club or anything. It's supposed to be just for the community development. But what is the marketing guy say, moonkanish? If you really want to be successful, you think you should join your local Rotary Club or a Lions Club or something. So you have a networking.\n\nBy the way, some people may get benefit. That's a side effect of my joining. My main goal was to get a networking. I actually did a leadership Metro moonkanish course in 2003. It's pretty prestigious. A lot of CEOs and presidents and all that.\n\nIt's basically leadership. It's for developing leadership for moonkanish area. But you ask them and what their incentive for you. Well, you will be knowing all the CEOs in this town and all these presidents in the town. So good networking tool for your business. Now, by the way, if somebody is doing that and helping the community is still good enough that the people who are doing these actions by their wrong reasons but having a right effect on the society, let them do it, don't stop them.\n\nBut it is not helping the person who is doing it. So that's action which is prompted by desire. And again, it is also done with an ego. I am doing it, you know, nobody else was ready, but I said nobody else could have done it. But I said I can do that. So kriyate Bahula Yasam and it requires lots of efforts.\n\nSomething which does not come naturally to you obviously requires lots of effort. The guy who is trained singer, when he sings, how much effort does he have to put nothing he naturally because he's trained. All his systems are wired for it. His vocal cords are trained for that. And he just comes out and sings and goes away. Somebody like me, somebody says, neel, you have to perform on such and such.\n\nWell, I have to practice and make sure that I understand lots of effort because it does not come naturally to me. So Bahula Yasam all our actions which are prompted by desire and done with ego require lots of efforts. And that's where we have a fatigue. When I say the burnout factor, you know, well, I had been helping this community for a long time. Well, volunteers make sure they don't get burned out. If they're truly volunteering, they will never get burned out.\n\nThey get burned out because there was something other than just helping was involved. Well, people are not giving me credit for what I'm doing. That feeling makes you burn out of what you are doing. Bhagavan said moonkanish gmail they are doing it with lots of efforts and therefore there is a fatigue, there is, there is a burnout factor. There is disharmony and agitation within. _Verses_ action creates bliss within and harmony outside.\n\n_Verses_ actions create agitation inside and disharmony outside. I wanted to do it, but he is now doing it. I wanted to be the president of this organization. Even though I don't get anything out of it, nobody pays me for that. But now he is doing it. So agitation, disharmony.\n\ngmail Rajasamudhaartam Therefore these actions are called Ch actions. Swamiji makes a very good point that even the great political leaders and great social workers and then great leaders in the business world, they all fall into gmail action when they are at the best of of their behavior or the best of their intentions. Because the same action can be Ch. One which looks like _Verses_ but could be Ch. Therefore he says the gmail actions are clearly better than Ch. You now just have to graduate to gmail to get the bliss which you're seeking, the happiness which you are looking for.\n\nYou have to transcend this Ch into Sattvik. But be careful what you consider your rajasiks in may be Ch. So the next verse says what will be Ch is _Verses_ moonkanish gmail, Ch _Verses_, moonkanish gmail, Ch, _Verses_ moonkanish. Those actions, first of all they are prompted by delusion. gmail Ch I want to do this because I do not know what is the right thing to do.",
      "reflection": "The Gita's final teaching is surrender. Not passive resignation, but active trust. Having done what you can, release the outcome.\n\nToday, identify one situation where you're holding on too tightly. Practice opening your hands. Let it be what it will be.\n\nArjuna's journey from paralysis to clarity, from confusion to conviction, is available to each of us. The teaching has been given. What remains is to live it."

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 18, Moksha Sanyasa yoga just to remind ourselves what we have seen so far. That in the beginning the Arjuna made a request. I want to know what is sannyasa and what is Tyaga? Because we had been talking about renunciation. This chapter is called Liberation to Renunciation. So the obvious answer is renouncing actions.\n\nAnd how do we renounce actions and what type of actions can we renounce or should we renounce is the gist of this chapter. So the first thing Bhagavan said is Kamyanam Karma Nam Nysa ITI Sanyasa Sannyas is giving up all the desire prompted actions and is sannyasa. That's as simple as it is. If I can give up all desire prompted actions so that I'm truly driven by my duties, the joy of working and whatever is appropriate for me to work, then I am a sannyasi. But that may or may not be possible. So the next is Sarvakarma Falat Tyaga Haiti Tyaga.\n\nIf you give up all the Karma Phala, the desire for the fruits of action, then it's a tyaga. So Bhagwat, once we start with tyaga because that may be more appropriate for us. So then he describes that even tyaga can be of three different types. So now the entire chapter now takes the aspect of actions which is what is binding us actions in our day to day life, what we call work. Work is becoming burden for us. That's why we all want to retire.\n\nAll our planning for is what retirement. That's because we are not enjoying the work. So Bhagawan said let's understand what tyaga is. So then we have seen that the tyaga also can be of three types of you can give up something which is you're appropriately giving up because of sattvic reasons or rajasic reasons or tamasic reasons. Then we said the tyaga we talked about of actions. So what type of actions should be Given up and what should not be given up?\n\nWe said the yajna dana tapa, this type of actions must be performed. So even the yajnas can be of three types. Sattvik, Rajasika, Tamasik, Dana also can be of three types. SattVik, Rajasik and tamasic. The disciplines which we follow can also be three types. Sattvik, rajasik, tamasik.\n\nIn other words, everything is tied to each other. How we think, how we behave and what the results come to us, they're all tied to each other. Our thinking is not sattvic, then obviously our actions will not be sattvic and therefore our results will not be satwik. So if we understand this mechanism of actions, then maybe we will be able to liberate ourselves from this burden of work. In India, at least in 60s that I can remember, first thing people ask is, so where are you working? Oh, I just got a job in government.\n\nI think it's a perfect job. I'll tell you, I hardly have to work. The definition of good job in many times in India was the job in which I did the least amount of work is a good job. Now is it really what I'm looking for in a job? I remember I went to Zambia in. I took a job at building department in government of Zambia.\n\nSo my chief architect, first day in orientation said, we have a requirement that in a year you should at least do three drawings. And I said, are you serious? He said, no, at least you should have three drawings in a year. So that was a government standard of your performance. Our basic understanding right now is that action is a burden. Actually, as long as I can get out of the actions, then I'll be happy.\n\nSo renouncing action is the goal of our life. But how to renounce action is the theme of this chapter. So we say even yajna dana tapas, which needs to be done also should be done in a manner that it liberates you and not binds you. So yagnas can be of three types, Dhyana can be of three types, and tapas can be of three types. And we all know sometimes we do charity. But that makes you unhappy.\n\nInstead of making you feel joy about giving, it makes you unhappy. That's because our attitude towards giving had something not right about it. So Bhagavan said, you should examine this thing in all things you do, whether it's sattvik, tamasic or rajasik, and see what is appropriate for you. Then we said, okay, Karma. Now let's understand what is the nature of Karma. And I said Karma, karana, karta.\n\nThese are the three constituent parts of any action. Any action will have a action, the doer and the instrument of action. And that requires knowledge. Gnanam, ganeum, pari, gnata. These are the three constituent parts of knowledge, the knowledge that is to be known and the knower. If we understand the mechanism of these actions and how the knowledge takes place, then we should be able to work better.\n\nSo then we have looked at how the knowledge takes place and how the action is related to it. So then we have been looking at and say, okay, now if knowledge also can be of three types. Some knowledge is Sattvic, some is Rajasic and some is Tamasic. Something I come to believe without any reason or rhyme could be tamasic. So knowledge also can be Sattvik, Rajasik or Tamasik. I should be very careful.\n\nEven I consider myself a more knowledgeable person. I need to examine whether my knowledge is appropriate or Sattvik or Rajasik or Tamasakya. Obviously, before whoever figured it out that earth is round, people had knowledge the earth is flat. But it was not really a knowledge based on any basis, but just a regular observation that looks like earth is flat. So sometimes what is quite obvious may not be the truth. So I need to be constantly vigilant about it.\n\nSo my knowledge also should be examined whether it is Rajasik, Tamasik or Sattvik. Then Karma, which I am performing, also can be Rajasic, Tamasic or Sattvik, depending on the knowledge which I have, is whether Sattvik, Rajasik or Tamasik. So these are all tied together in every aspect of my life. I should be examining whether this is the most appropriate way to behave. So then the verses which we'll be saying today they about Karta, Karta. I consider myself the doer.\n\nNow am I a Sattvik doer, a Rajasic doer, a Tamasic doer? Then we find out that it's not a consistent that I am not always a Sattvic doer, I'm not always a Rajasik doer. I'm not always a Tamasik doer. At times I'm Sattvik, at times I'm Rajasik, at times I'm Tamasik. However, I must examine that and make sure that I do not become predominantly Tamasic or Rajasek. Because the results of tamas and rajas we have seen is nothing but pain in the end.\n\nThe only thing which liberates you is sattva, the pure knowledge. When I start seeing things as they are, that's where the liberation comes in. Anytime I have bias of my own, then I'm bound by my own bias. More and more people realizing that more they limit themselves to one viewpoint or one group of people, they're binding themselves to limitations. The more they open up, they become more liberated and make more progress. So the verse 26 says Mukta Sangha Anahamvadi Dhruti Utsa Samanvitah Siddhi Asidyo nirvikaraha karta satvika uchate.\n\nIf I am a doer and I consider I am the person who is performing this action well, let's see in what attitude I have performed this action. Mukta sangha Anahamwadi is free from attachment. Am I really too attached to this action? If somebody let me do it is great. If I don't get a chance to do this, am I okay? Or the world is going to come apart if I don't get a chance to do this unattached Anahumwadi that he does not have ego that I am the doer.\n\nI am the only one who can do it. I can do this so that we know that if I can do it, the others can also do it. However, I can put the best efforts if I want. Anahumwadi the dhruti utsa saman vidaha I think this is at least from my life I understood that is the most important part. Whether you are successful or not successful in what you are pursuing. Again dhruti persistent firmness.\n\nThis is what I want to do. When I came to this country, I kept giving my life's example because that's all I know is my life. When I came to this country, I met some architects who had been here 10 years before I had come. So I asked their advice and said what should I do? I need to get registration as a licensed architect in this country. They forget about it.\n\nIt's not really worth it. It will take you 10 years. There are better professions with your architectural training. You can be a pipe draftsman or something which will give you a better compensation. And I say, I'll tell you honestly, the only thing I know is architecture. So I need to pursue architecture.\n\nWhether there are good chances in this country or not. I have to continue find my niche because I don't know anything better. But I say only thing I know is doing architecture. So Dhruti, if you want to Be successful in architecture. Stay with architecture. Don't buy a gas station, you don't open up a hotel.\n\nDhruti is the most important aspect of any actions we will perform. If you are yourself not firm about it, people will recognize right away that you are not serious about it. And the next which I learned from my guru Swami Chinmayun Utsa enthusiasm Saa Vardha Kaya Namah Swamiji has a unique quality. He will infuse enthusiasm in anybody he meets. Everybody in front of him was like Swamiji we can do this and Swamiji we can do that. That's a unique quality that you can inspire people to be enthusiastic about what they are doing.\n\nAnd again, if you are not enthusiastic, everybody else will be also the same way. The most important aspect of any doer or the qualities of any diverse Dhruti, utsa samanvitah Siddhi, Asidyo nirvikaraha. Having done all that, the result is not in my hand. I may be the best person, I may be the best firm. But the world may have different needs and the world may react differently. And therefore it may not be a successful action.\n\nAnd I should be unattached to that. Do not get affected by it. We are human beings, we have emotions. We may feel slightly bad about it, but you have to move on from that. It should not affect your personality that now I'm rejected one time, I will not try next time. In fact, continue trying to persistently keep going back and back to the same organization or efforts to be successful.\n\nPersistence pays off. Siddhi Asidyo Nirvikarah karta satvikochate. Such an actor, such a doer is considered Sattvik. He may be successful, he may not be successful. He may be appreciated. He may not be appreciated.\n\nBut he knows that he's pursuing this with all his zeal and all firmness. So that's such a doer is Sattvik the next one. Ragi Karma Phala prepsuhu lubdaha in Satmakaha Asuchi Harshoka Anvitah karta Rajasah Parikertita. However, when we are in that mode, we don't recognize it. Unfortunately, it's a ragi attached sometimes with a good virtue. He's very passionate about it.\n\nPassion is something which can be very tricky to recognize whether it is positive or negative. The same passion, it is based on your dhruti then it is positive.",
      "reflection": "The Gita's final teaching is surrender. Not passive resignation, but active trust. Having done what you can, release the outcome.\n\nToday, identify one situation where you're holding on too tightly. Practice opening your hands. Let it be what it will be.\n\nArjuna's journey from paralysis to clarity, from confusion to conviction, is available to each of us. The teaching has been given. What remains is to live it."

      "commentary": "We've been discussing chapter 18, Moksa Sannyasa Yoga. Yoga of Liberation through Renunciation. The goal is liberation and the tool is Sannyasa. Liberation is always from some bondage and normally we think the bondage is always imposed on someone else. In this case, Bhagavad Gita says the bondages are imposed by my own self. I myself has imposed these bondages on me by identifying with this material body, material self, that equipment which I used to transact with this world, I falsely understood it to be me.\n\nAnd now all the limitations of this instrument became my limitations. Sorrows and unhappiness are just the product of these limitations. And therefore, if I need to find ultimate happiness, ultimate liberation from the sorrows and unhappiness need to get rid of the bondages. So this chapter says this liberation can only come from Sannyasa. That is the only means available to us is Sannyasa. So then what is Sannyasa we learn is Kamyanam Karmanam Nyasa.\n\nAll you have to do is simply give up the desire prompted actions. This we found is not easy. So the means again given is Tyaga. Give up the anxiety for the fruits of actions and over a period of time you will develop Sannyasa. Once you give up the anxiety of the fruits of action, work in this world and you will develop that understanding of who you are and you will overcome the limitations that you have. That basically what we understood in the gist of the entire Bhagavad Gita.\n\nSo now this chapter summarizing our endeavor, pursuing this path of Tyaga and then ultimately getting Sannyasa, examining all the qualities that we have acquired by just associating with this Prakriti. We have this long history of associating with this Prakriti. All this time the only thing I could associate with is my material nature. Therefore all the qualities of the Prakriti became my qualities. And we have learnt in Vedanta that this Prakriti has three basic Gunas, Satvarajas and Tamas. So Everything associated with me tainted by these three gunas.\n\nMy goal is to go beyond these three gunas and liberate myself from this identification of this Prakriti. So therefore, we have examined what makes me attached to this work. And the first thing came the Gnana. The knowledge that the Prakriti exists and I'm aware of it, makes me identify with it. It's like somebody says, why are you climbing this mountain? If I did not know it is there, I would never have any need to climb that mountain.\n\nBut because it is there, I have to now climb it. Because I'm aware of the Prakriti, I identify with that recruitment because I'm aware of the world of my liking. I identify with the world which I like. Also I'm aware of the world of my dislike. And again, I identify with that world for avoiding it. So my entire pursuit in life becomes pursuing that which I like and avoid that which I don't like.\n\nIn all cases, what is common is my knowledge about that field of activity. The first thing you need to say, what is the Gnana? The Gnana, what you consider Gnana at this time is of the Prakriti. Therefore it falls into these three categories of Sattvik, Rajasic and Tamasic. Just as the nature of the Prakruti has these three gunas, so we've seen the knowledge is also Sattvic, Rajasik and Tamasic. Then he said, now the next person involved in this action is the Karta.\n\nOne who considers that I exist and I do things. He said, that person again is tainted by the three gunas of the Prakriti because of the identification of the Prakriti. So the Karta can be Satvagraja, tamasic. Now you put two together. Either Sattvik, Raja, Tamsic. Knowledge, I as the doer, has the tendencies which are satva, grajav, tamasik.\n\nThe final product which comes out actions will also be satva, girajasika, tamasek. All these we are evaluating and understanding so that we can introspect and see where do we fall in this category where my actions fall? Because one thing we have learned is the gradual progression is from Tamasic to Rajasic to Satwik. Once I have purified my mind and intellect, the only obligation I have as the seeker of the truth is to purify my internal instrument, Antakarana, my mind and intellect. Once mind and intellect is pure, the knowledge will shine through by itself, there will be no effort required. Therefore, we keep hearing the term praptasyaprapti.\n\nThis knowledge which I'm seeking about myself is already available to me. It's already with me. I'm just not seeing it because I'm so engrossed in the knowledge of this world that I'm completely oblivious about the knowledge about myself. Once I get rid of this knowledge which is falsely coloring my personality in satvirajasuktamasik, the knowledge will shine through. To know this and to negate the qualities which are binding gradually rise from Tamasic to Rajasiva Sattvik. Once I reach that sattvic tendencies and my mind and intellect are purified, the knowledge will shine through.\n\nIf this room is dark, my key is in this room. Only thing I require is turn the lights on. It will be very easy for me to find where my keys are. So Bhagawan said that this knowledge is within yourself. You already have it and therefore nothing new you will find. There is no new accomplishments to be made.\n\nThere is no new achievements to be achieved. But finding your own self would be like finding the keys in your pocket and becoming aware of it. Therefore, the world is realization. All I am becoming realized about my own self. So if you examine Gnana Karta, Karma, then Bhagwancha Buddhi, which is a guiding factor. I see the objects or the field of actions in this world, then knowledge takes place.\n\nMind decide whether it is like or unlikable. Finding guidance from the intellect, then intellect will tell you how to act in this world. So therefore Buddhi is to be evaluated as whether it is Sattvik, Rajasik or Tamasik. So we have looked at the Buddhi also. Now all of that is only useful if I'm consistently pursuing my path of evolution from Tamasic to Rajasic to Sattvik. Because anything if I do once in a while is of not great value.\n\nSomething which I do consistently, then it will have positive effect for me to become an expert in anything, I have to continuously work in that field. Once in a while I do something, it becomes hobby. That's why I'm not so good. But somebody who does it consistently, he becomes good at it. So Bhagawan said Dhruti is very important factor in becoming successful and getting rid of this unhappiness and sorrows. The limitations of this body and then intellectual the bondages to get rid of them and to work consistently that consistency as we have seen as dhruti so before, Dhruti can also be classified as of three types.\n\nEach one of us who is seeking happiness is consistently trying to be happy. See, it's not that nobody will be blamed for not trying to be happy. So if you ask anybody in this world, no matter what his position is, what his caste is, what his creed is, what's the goal of your life? Have you ever tried to be happy? And the answer is, of course I'm trying. Every day, every minute of my life, I'm trying to be happy.\n\nI'm very consistent in finding my happiness. But how many of us are successful? The statistics are not so good. The Bhagawan says, that's because this dhruti with which you're finding your happiness also comes in three varieties. Drutya, Yaya, Dharayate Manah, Prana, Indriya, Kriya Yogena or Vyabicharynya Dhruti Sapartha Satviki. Swamiji says, and many commentators believe that Dhruti is very loosely translated in English language.\n\nBecause the essence of the word Dhruti cannot be translated without understanding it. Dhruti's fortitude, in other words, grit an inner strength, a force from my inner personality which will not let me give up. The things which I consider are important to me. I'm trying to achieve something. We know this world will throw some obstacles in my path. It will all dependent on how strong I am in pursuing my goal.\n\nWhen I encounter great difficulties, I'll evaluate my situation. My Buddhi will say, I don't think it's worth it. We will weigh the pros and cons of this situation and say, what are my risk and reward here? Depending on what I come up with, I say, well, it's not worth pursuing it. Or I'll say, well, risk is not that great. Reward may be great, let's pursue it.\n\nPrabhagawan said, that's Buddhi. Beyond this Buddhi, there is an inner strength which no matter what the circumstances are, will make me pursue my path. Bhagawan says that dhruti. He said that dhruti also can be of three types. The first one is Dhruti, which by the power of yoga will control my manah, Pranaha and Indriyaha. That inner force which by the power of yoga.\n\nBecause I had been pursuing this path and I have seen the glimpse of my own self, I know that all the things which I associate with this Prakriti is temporary. And therefore it will allow me to control my mind, my vital functions and my senses. We know how the my world of actions work. Senses go out and get the information about the objects in this world. Mind decide he wants to pursue it or not. Intellect will guide the mind whether it is worth performing that action or not.\n\nMy tendency will override whatever my Buddhi will tell me to do. The Bhagavan says that force from my inner self which will let me control my mind. I control the mind, I control my senses. It also control my intellect. So Bhagavan said that Dhrutti which allows me to control my mind, vital functions and senses is Satvik Dhruti. I'm firmly established in what is the truth.\n\nAnd therefore it is allowing me to pursue my path to stay connected with my truth is the Satvik Dhruti. Next one is Yayatu Dharma Kama, Artha Dharayate, Arjunah, Prasangayana, Falakangsi, Dhruti, Sapaarta Rajasi. This one we can relate to very easily. The Bhagavanta Dhrutti which is allowing me to pursue my Dharma, Artha and Kama by Prasangena by attachment. Attachment to my Dharma, attachment to my Kama and attachment of Artha Falakaan. Because I want to get something out of it.\n\nI am pursuing my Dharma as whatever you put it, as an architect, as a father. Because I want results out of that. So I'm firmly pursuing my path of being an architect. I want to continue practicing it. Why I want something out of it. I'm attached to my Dharma.\n\nMost people, if you take their profession away from them, they feel completely lost. They don't know who they are. But once it went, I am pursuing my path of Dharma Orthayanaka. The four goals of life we have learned in our scriptures, Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha. The waiting vow is also. There are four steps you take will do things which is in line with my Dharma.\n\nWhatever my Swadharma, whatever is my duties, I'll follow them. I will only be able to sustain my Dharma if I have enough wealth. Narayana also sustained this world by the power of Lakshmi. Take the Lakshmi away from Narayana. Narayana cannot sustain this world. So if I want to eartha acquiring wealth 4 Kama I want to fulfill my desires.\n\nThese three I'm consistently pursuing my life driven by Prasanga and Falakangshi. Because I'm attached to this three. And I want to get results out of them. And Swamiji says the Bhagavan leaves out moksha because typically we are not really interested in moksha simply because I think the happiness will be in pursuing these three.",
      "reflection": "The Gita's final teaching is surrender. Not passive resignation, but active trust. Having done what you can, release the outcome.\n\nToday, identify one situation where you're holding on too tightly. Practice opening your hands. Let it be what it will be.\n\nArjuna's journey from paralysis to clarity, from confusion to conviction, is available to each of us. The teaching has been given. What remains is to live it."

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 18, moonkanish Sannyasa yoga Yoga of Liberation through Renunciation. We had been discussing all throughout the chapter that this renunciation is about the sense of doership. Right now I have this sense of doership which makes me a doer. Therefore I am bound by my own actions. But once you renounce that doership in knowledge that my true self is not the doer and therefore it's all related to the actions which I perform in this life. So we have seen the entire chapter discussing the quality of actions and how the actions are performed.\n\nIt also says that if I'm not attached to my ex, if I do not have gmail com Ch and my Buddhi is not tainted, then even if I kill, I do not kill and I'm not bound by my actions. So the bondage is because of my doership in all the actions that I perform. So therefore we have seen the physiology of action and the three things are important. Knowledge of the field actor and then the act of acting which is action itself. These three we have discussed in detail that they are affected by the qualities of the Prakriti. Prakriti we normally translate in English as nature.\n\nSo you can apply that. What is the nature of my knowledge, nature of my actions and nature of my own self will affect the outcome of this actions. And we have seen because they are part of the Prakriti, they are affected by the Sattva Rajasav Thomas. So the knowledge can be Sattvik Raja Sikha Tamasek. The Karta can be Sattvik Rajasika Tamasek. Therefore the actions will be Sattvikrajasikhva tamasica.\n\nAnd then we have seen that this is driven by the Buddhi and Dhruti. What kind of actions I will perform is dependent on my Buddhi. So I have a Sattvic Buddhi. I will be performing Sattvic actions because Buddhi is the guiding factor. Buddhi as we have seen is the Reservoir of all my experiences in memory that creates my tendencies. The Buddhi will finally decide whether it's to be done or not to be done based on what I have considered it to be.\n\nMy duties, my past experiences, the outcome which I had in past. See the Buddhi also depending on my past experiences and outcomes of my past experiences can be Satwik, Rajasik or Dhanasik. No action can be successful unless there is dhruti, fortitude, persistent efforts. So what kind of a Dhruti I have will also be affecting my outcome of my actions. So we have seen that dhruti, the fortitude or grit can also be of three types. Even the person who is trying to rob a bank, he also need the fortitude.\n\nYou know, he may fail. One time he goes there first time he figures out that this is not the right time. He goes back again and again till he finds the right time to rob the bank. So this Dhruti also can be of a Rajasik, Satvik or Tamasic. We have seen that these five are connected three causes of actions and two the supporters. The Buddhim, Dhruti who makes the action possible.\n\nThey all can be Sattvik, Rajasik or Tamasic. Now you can see the permutation combinations of all this. There are myriads of variations of actions that we see in this world. But the reason we all act is one and the same. We all want happiness. So this moonkanish which comes out of these actions can also be three types.\n\nNow moonkanish can be translated in English either as Comfortable I'm comfortable, I'm a sukhi. I'm a dukhi unhappy or not comfortable. So the moonkanish either is a comfort or a joy or happiness. Any three of these words can be associated with word moonkanish In Sanskrit, two words, moonkanish and ananda. So what is the difference between these two moonkanish and Ananda is what we obviously were trying to figure out. But in this case it says the moonkanish is the goal for all my actions.\n\nBecause moonkanish I associate really with happiness. Comfort I associate with happiness. The word moonkanish originated from the word for the space for the axle in a chariot. So su come is akasha space. Sukhum good space for the axle or the chariot Duke come not so good space. In other words, the hole in that chariot wheel is perfectly round it sukkam.\n\nIf it is not perfectly round it moonkanish. Why the ride will not be comfortable if the axle is perfectly balanced in its pace? And there is no space in between so it can wobble. Then your ride will be comfortable. So that comfortable ride is associated with sukhum. Dukkham will be not very comfortable ride because your chariot is not doing well with that space for that axle is not perfect.\n\nSo this sukhum is associated with comfort that I experience in life. So the comfort actually relates to the outside environment. If temperature is right in this room, it is comfortable. Temperature is too high or too low, somebody will start complaining. So it relates to the outside condition. My happiness or my comfort is dependent on the outside environment.\n\nThat Sukhkharm is generally associated with your outside conditions. I was watching one of these interviews with Bill Gates and somebody asked him, do you relate your wealth with happiness? And he said yes, I think wealth does give happiness. I don't have to worry about the health care cost or anything like that. He right away related that to other people's problems. Because their conditions are not as comfortable as his.\n\nIs that because of his wealth he didn't have to worry about the normal things people have to worry about. So the moonkanish is typically the outside condition. Joy or Ananda is the state of mind. So happiness is a state of mind. It can be in a Sukhir Dukhi condition. Outside condition may not be comfortable but I may be still happy.\n\nmoonkanish and moonkanish when it relates to the body, mind and intellect they are obviously related to outcome of my efforts. So this verse defines three types of moonkanish which are the results of my actions. moonkanish _part _part, _part _part. The moonkanish also can be of three types. I'm acting in this world so that my life is comfortable and I achieve the happiness. Why do you want to be comfortable?\n\nBecause I want to be happy. In the end it's all about happiness. We know happiness is a state of mind. Somehow if my mind feels that it's the perfect condition then it will be happy. Till that time it will keep complaining. I may have the best car, but that's not the car I wanted.\n\nI wanted something else. Well, I'm not really happy. moonkanish Tvani _part Sruname _part. Listen, that moonkanish can be of three times. So moonkanish is also not common to all. Our standard example is smoking.\n\nThat which gives moonkanish to one person, the guy sitting next to him, it gives him discomfort. So moonkanish also is personal and depending on my tendencies and my likings and my disliking Abhyasad Ramatei Yatra dukkhantam chanigachati. But if you practice properly, this moonkanish can lead to the end of moonkanish. If you figure out what is the cause of your moonkanish and work towards it, the Sukhakan leads to to the end of moonkanish. That's all this verse says. The verse says there are three types of moonkanish.\n\nAnd if you're intelligent enough to find out what is the cause of your moonkanish then you can end that moonkanish. But my problem is something else. And I'm working on something else. Gujarat is saying moonkanish gmail com Ch a stomach ache. But I'm hitting my head, you know. So if my cause of my moonkanish is something else but I'm keep trying to fix other things, it will not help.\n\nTherefore he said that Abhyasat drama te yatra moonkanish n e gachati. With constant practice of figuring out what is moonkanish and how to avoid it, Bhagavan Buddha finally figured out what is the cause of all all these dukkhas in this world. He said, well, no matter what situation, everybody's unhappy, somebody sick, somebody's old, somebody's poor. And he finally found one universal cause for all moonkanish. He said desire is the cause for all moonkanish. If you get rid of the desire, all moonkanish will go away.\n\nSo Bhagawan said, you should understand the nature of moonkanish also. Just because it is comfortable, it will not give you happiness. Yat agre visam Eva _Verses_ Amruto Upamam Tatsukam Satvikam proktam _Verses_ _Verses_ _Verses_. Every word is important here to understand. So it says the Satvik moonkanish is which is compared to poison Visham and so difficult climbing Mount Everest in. I don't know why people do it.\n\nI have never figured out so something which you consider moonkanish. And if you want to achieve that but you have to go through hell. The road to heaven passes through hell. So you have to go through hell to get to heaven. Bhagavan said that that which is in the beginning like a poison but in the end like nectar. That is Sattvika moonkanish.\n\nBut where does it come from? It says _Verses_ Buddhi Prasada jam. It comes as a _Verses_ from your Buddhi which is established in yourself. One who has realized his own nature, true nature that Buddhi will Give you a _Verses_. So as we use the word _Verses_ in our day to day language, when you go to temple and do puja, at the end there is a _Verses_. Now this _Verses_ is not really guaranteed on my efforts.\n\nBecause it's up to the pujari, whatever the _Verses_, whether I get a banana or mango, whether they had all these fruits and one mango. So Meena said that her eye was on the mango. But then she asked the first person, whatever fruit you want to take, take the one fruit from here. That person took the mango. If you are given a choice, it's not really a _Verses_. Prasad is to be given.\n\nSwami used to say, you go to the _Verses_, just take it from. Prasad is to be given. Prasad is never taken. Prasad is something which is not in my control. It comes because of my efforts automatically. So that _Verses_ of integrating my _Verses_ with the truth, what comes out of it as a result of that is the _Verses_ of that integration.\n\nSo the _Verses_ which is established in the self which gives you _Verses_ in a form of a moonkanish bliss, Bhagwan says that's a Sattvik moonkanish. But to get to that point was like a poison. All the efforts that you do put to figure out what my true self is going through all the experiences in life. See, when Buddha went through all these experiences in his life, he went from one teacher to another. He left his kingdom, left his wife, left his child, meditated for years. Finally under the Bodhi tree, he realized what the real nature of the truth is.\n\nThen he achieved the bliss. The Bhagavan said that that moonkanish which is obtained after vigorous efforts, that gives the most satisfaction. Because if you earned your moonkanish, then that will give you the most happiness. If you have come to that final point of integrating your mind and intellect so that it recognize yourself that Sukkah will be a permanent moonkanish. And therefore it is sattvic in contrast to that. Visaya indriya Saiyogat yatt ugre _Verses_ _Verses_ _Verses_, Vishamiva _Verses_ _Verses_ _Verses_.\n\nBut that which is very pleasant in the beginning because it is born out of context of sense organs with the sense objects, nice silky clothes, nice bed, those things give you happiness because of the context of the sense organs with the sense object which feels like net in the beginning.",
      "reflection": "The Gita's final teaching is surrender. Not passive resignation, but active trust. Having done what you can, release the outcome.\n\nToday, identify one situation where you're holding on too tightly. Practice opening your hands. Let it be what it will be.\n\nArjuna's journey from paralysis to clarity, from confusion to conviction, is available to each of us. The teaching has been given. What remains is to live it."

      "commentary": "Chapter 18, Moksha Sanyasa Yoga. This is obviously the last chapter in our studies of Bhagavad Gita. So we had been systematically studying Bhagavad Gita. The goal of that is to figure out how I should act in this world so that I can get the maximum happiness. So we have first understood who we are in the Bhagavad Gita as individuals, how we function in this world. And then we have also talked about who is that?\n\nWho has the control over this entire universe and therefore also over my life. We are coming to the end portion of the Bhagavad Gita. We are synthesizing this knowledge about who we are at the individual level. What is my relationship with this world and the Supreme Being? But the bottom line still remains, how can I be happy? So in this chapter we are analyzing the factors affecting my actions and the outcome of my actions.\n\nSo in the beginning, Arjun asked what is sannyas and what is thyaga? Because in all this discussion I picked up these two words which ultimately lead to happiness, ultimately leads you to liberation, freedom from all the sorrows and unhappiness. So I want to understand these two concepts so I can find out how I can act in this world. Number one, very simply said, giving up all desire prompted actions is Sanyas. If you can reach a point where you don't have to do anything to satisfy your desires, then you are a sannyasi. That can only happen when I have exhausted all the desire.\n\nThere is no desire left. Therefore I don't have to act for my desires. That can only happen if I have no ego and no individual identification. Sarva Karma Falatyagama stagger. That seems like the goal one can strive for that I can probably work on Tyaga part. But because the Tyaga can be misunderstood, giving up, abandoning something can be misunderstood.\n\nWe went into discussion about this. Tyaga also can be of three types. This Prakriti has three qualities. So anything which is associated with the Prakriti will have the same Triguna used example before that every gold ornament will have the same ingredient of gold. Gold ornaments also come in different carats. 18 carat versus 16 carat, 12 carats 24 carat.\n\nI think what that means is there is something else is mixed into gold. You cannot make an ornament out of pure gold. They have to add zinc. It is the proportion of that metal can change. But every gold ornament will have those at a golden zinc, which makes it more malleable, more workable. It is the proportion which makes it the 12 carat vs 18 karat vs 24 karat is also like that.\n\nThe first thing come to mind is I should give up all my actions. So we reaffirm that action cannot be given up by anybody. It is not possible for a living being to completely abandon all actions. Therefore, now we need to understand what actions to be abandoned. In the beginning, Bhagawan gave an indication desire prompted actions. So what actions should I perform?\n\nYajna Dana Tapa should not be given up at any cost. The actions which are purifying your mind and intellect, they should be performed. And then we talked about the anatomy of action. Because we are going to be focused on actions all our life. And we are going to be focusing on how I should act in the right manner and what actions are to be abundant. Or we looked at three propellers of actions.\n\nThe knowledge, Gnanam, Gnem, Parignatha, the knowledge, the knower and the knowable. We also seen the Karanam, Karma, Karta, iti, Trivedha, Karma, Sangraha. Action only comes into the existence. If these three are there. The instrument of action, the doer, then the Karma. Then we analyze that Gnana Karmanakarta also can be of three types.\n\nAnything which is part of the Prakriti will have the same three ingredients in different proportions. Gnana, Karma and Karta also the three types. We also say the Buddhyana, Dhruti. The foundation of any action, my intellect and my fortitude. Basically make any action possible or success in any action possible. Even those two also can come in three different varieties.\n\nAnd in the end our goal was to get Sukham, happiness or Ananda. See this Sukha also can be three types. Sattvik, Sukha, which is at the beginning seems like a poison. But in the end it is like a nectar. Work hard to get somewhere. But when you get there, there is joy there.\n\nSo that's a Sattvik sukha. It seems good in the beginning, but in the end it gives pain. That's a rajasik suga. So the pleasures in life which we pursue, they are like Rajasik sukha. It gives you some joy, but in the end it gives you unhappiness. Even going to vacation every time you come back, I'm tired, I can't do anything.\n\nI need a vacation from my vacation, you know. So every pleasure which we seek in the end it ends them into some kind of a misery. So the bhagawan says, that's Rajya Sikh sukha. It starts as very pleasant, ends in unpleasantness. This tamasik sukha is. It is not enjoyable in the beginning, is also not enjoying in the end.\n\nScratching when we start, it's not really that pleasant. And after you are done with it, it is also very painful. This is why Bhagavan said, that's a tamasikshu. And then we are coming to the segment where Bhagavan said, therefore now understand that everything in this Prakriti is made up of these three gunas. So human beings are also affected by these three gunas. These three gunas affect all the people we come across and ourselves.\n\nAnd based on those gunas, they can be also classified into Sattvik, Rajasic and Tamasic. But we may get confused. The Bhagawan makes it clear that everybody understands that it is not possible for anything or a being in this Prakriti to not have any one of these three gunas. All three gunas have to be present for a thing or being to exist in space and time. So something to exist in space and time, it has to inertia. Without inertia, the thing just cannot.\n\nOtherwise it vanishes the time it's created. You know, somebody give an example. I think as an MB who gave a story of Brahmaji when he first created this human being. They all completely sattvik. He said as soon as Brahmaji created, they all went back to their true nature. So he said Brahmaji was really baffled.\n\nHow can I keep this thing stable? The inertia tamas makes things remain in this time and space. But the thing also cannot remain what it is. And it rajast with activities. We now know from science that even atom which seems stable has intense activity in it. All electrons are circling around that neutral proton.\n\nAnd the thing needs to know that I exist, which is Sattva. So Sattva raja santamus I exist, I act and I remain in my place. These three are absolutely necessary for anything or being to be in existence. So the verses which we are coming to now says for our own clarification that Na tad asthi prithivyam va divi deveshu va punah Sattvam prakritei muktaha yat yabhi sha tribhigan on this earth and also in the heavens among Devas, there is not a single being who is free from all these three gunas. So thinking yourself without these three gunas is not possible. But at the same time we keep hearing Bhagavan keeps saying Guna teet Bhava Arjuna.\n\nWe probably understood that I should go beyond this guna, so I should get rid of all three gunas. Bhagawan said that is not possible. You can stop identifying with this Guna. So my mind is working in Tamasic mode or Rajasic mode. I should be able to introspect and say it's my mind which is a rajasic mode. If I can make him go to Sattvic mode, it will be more comfortable.\n\nBut if I identify with my mind, am I obviously identifying with my mind and intellect? So you can be Gunati the only if you're not identifying with your limited self. So Bhagavan said, be clear that these three gunas are present in all beings, divine beings and also the mortals on this planet. They all are affected by these three gunas. And therefore all humanity and all beings can be classified into Sattva, Grajatika, Tamasik depending on their predominant qualities. Brahman, Kshatriya, Vishyam, Shudranamcha, Parantpa, Karmani, Pravibakthani, Swabhava, Prabhavai Gunai.\n\nThis is basically a clarification for all of us who have this confusion about what is this caste system. Bhagavan created Brahman, Vishyanshudra and therefore now you are bound by this divisions. It clearly says that Karmani, Pravibakthani, Swabhava, Prabhavai Gunaihe. Their duties are divided among this Brahmakshatriya, Vaishna Sudra for their own nature, Prabhavayi Gunai hi. According to their own nature, their duties are determined for Brahma, Vaishya, Kshudra and Kshatriya. So it is your own nature which makes you Brahman or Kshatri or Shudra or Vaishya.\n\nBhagavan makes it Clear here it is not by birth, not by association, not by caste, creed, color, texture of your mind and intellect. Your gunas will make you the Brahma Kshatriya, Vishya, Sudra, Shamah, Damah, Tapaha, Shaucham Kshantihi, Arjamam, Evacha, Gnanam, Vignanam, Astikyam, Brahma Karma, Swabhavajam. First he said their duties in life are attributed to them in according to their own nature. You have to give person work or his place in your company, in your society and community what his aptitude is for. That's why I think before going to college you take aptitude test even in a company. Also the two engineers come.\n\nOne may be more research oriented and other may be more practical oriented. You put them in right place. In our profession it is much more clearer that we are all architects. But some are more design oriented so they can design, some more creative. Some are more technical minded so they can put things together in a building a little better. And some are more into administrative.\n\nMake sure that things are done right. So we used to have three divisions in companies. There used to go to design department, Production department and Construction Administration department. Suppose more glamorous because it's creative. But depending on your aptitude, you end up going from one to the another. Now sometimes even if you don't have aptitude, you think because design is more glamorous, I want to go there.\n\nBut then you would be miserable because you won't be able to perform your task properly. Eventually you end up going where your aptitude is whether you like it or not. Bhagawan said that the duties are distributed among them according to their own gunas. Now how do I know what gunas Bhagavan says know what Brahmana's qualities are? Shamaha, control over the mind, mental control, Shamah Dhammah, physical control, control over your senses, Tapaha austerity. Any discipline which you follow, Shaucham, purity, Shantihi, forgiveness, Arjvam, straightforwardness.\n\nWhatever it is, you can see clearly Gnanam, Vignanam, knowledge and also Vignanam applied knowledge, the application of knowledge, Astikyam, faith in the underlying truth. That this world has its basis. We have learnt in Bhagavad before that those people who are of a devilish qualities, they think there is no basis in this world. The Bhagawan says the Astikyam that faith in their underlying truth, the underlying reality in this nature Brahma Karma Swabajam. This comes naturally to Brahmins in other words, the people who have these qualities are the Brahmins. Now you identified you are that person.\n\nYou ask him to run a business. Obviously he is not good at it. So you can't really put somebody in charge of something he is not good at.",

      ],
      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 18 and we have so far analyzed the actions, knowledge and the actor. Now, as we have seen, everything is kind of classified into three classes depending on the qualities of the actions, knowledge or the actors. Now we are going into the classification of human beings. We also classified the Sukha, the happiness or the pleasure which comes from your actions. Actions are performed for as we said and discussed many times for two purposes only. One is to gain happiness and other is to avoid unhappiness.\n\nThere are actions we perform simply to make sure that there is no sorrow. Your retirement planning for avoiding sorrow in the future, when I'm not working, I'm not able to work. I need planning for my retirement. That's for avoiding unhappiness. But I am accumulating money to buy a BMW to get happiness. So there are two reasons we work in this world.\n\nWe have identified those. The happiness that comes out of these actions can also be either sattvic happiness. It may take very painful efforts in the beginning, but in the end it will be like nectar. Or it will feel like nectar now, but in the end it turns out to be more painful. Or the last one we have seen is something which in the beginning it is painful, in the end also painful. But I do it because I think that's the only way I can get some comfort.\n\nSo now why people act in this manner? The next few verses which we will see said, we are all driven by our qualities. So Bhagavan vastu, pravartate, Beings and things in this world are driven by their own qualities. So if you ask me to go for football match, no matter how hard you try, unless there is some other temptation you give, I won't go to football match. As I said when I was in Dallas, we will have all the social party football matches. The temptation was all the socializing and the food and friends.\n\nFootball was least of my concern because it's not in my nature. But you have a music party. I will stay hungry if I need to sing. Obviously you can't really sing with a full stomach. So I'll be the last one to eat while everybody has left. Because I want to make sure that I am at my best when my Tron comes to sing.\n\nSo I'm sacrificing something for which my own nature says it's pleasurable. So the next few verses it says. nastih prathivyam vyam va divi deveshu va punah sattvam prakruti jai Muktam Yadebhi sat tribhirgunaih. Now first thing they say, well, if I understood all that, I'm going to get rid of all the Tamas. I'm going to get rid of all the Rajas. I'll be just Sattvik.\n\nBhagavan said, it is really not possible that there is no being on this earth or again in the heaven. It's our conception that we are the mortal beings on this planet earth and they are immortal beings or devas are in the heaven. These Devas, even you know, Purana says they also have their qualities. Some devas are angry, some manipulate, some do this, you know, that's all the Pura Puranic stories. So it says, there is no being, whether a human being or a divine being, Deva, who is totally liberated from the three qualities. One cannot get rid of these three qualities totally.\n\nBecause once you liberate from these Gunas, you're out of the Prakriti, you're out of Maya. These three gunas are the characteristics of Maya, the Prakriti, the manifest world. As long as you are part of the manifest world as a being, these three has to be there. All these three has to be there to make you a being in this world. Therefore, Bhagavan said, there is no being on this planet or anywhere else in this universe who can be liberated completely from these three gunas. The day you transcend all three gunas, there is no Gita class, there is no you, there is no I.\n\nOnly the supreme self who was never tainted by this Prakriti. So the next verse says Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishyam, Shudranamcha, Parantapa, Karmani, pravibhaktani, svabhava, prabhavaih, gunaih. This is not a social commentary on Indian caste system. Bhagavad Gita was not written after the caste system was already has been completely polluted by whatever the social thinking, all the historical influences. So this is not a social commentary. So let's not get confused with what happened in India for last fully few thousand years on the caste system or Varanashram, it simply says Brahmanakshatriya, Vishyam, Shudranamcha, Parantapa Karmani, Pravibhaktani, svabhava, Prabhaivi Gunehi.\n\nWhatever the predominant quality in being, their karmas are assigned accordingly. If my aptitude is to sing, but then you say no, there is no singing here. You're going to dance today. Obviously that's not really something I can do. And that happens to me all the time. We go to a party and then everybody starts dancing.\n\nAnd I'm the one who has no real interest at all. But why you are not dancing? Because I don't like dancing. That's why I'm not dancing. So Bhagavan said that each one's actions karma is assigned as per the predominant Gunas. The Brahman, Rakshatriya, Vaishyam or Rakshudra.\n\nNow these classifications are not based on what we understand today based on the Gunas. And we tend to conveniently forget the Bhagavan is already said in the Bhagavad Gita, Chaturvaranam, Maya Shrushta Guna, Karma, Vibhaga Saha. Depending on their gunas, their qualities and their actions. I have created four types of people in this world. I'm not a Brahmin and you are not Akshudra. Everybody in this country of 250 million people or so has eaten equal right.\n\nThe citizens I'm talking about has equal right to be a president of this country. How many in this class wants to be a president of this country? We have no desire to be that. We have no qualities to become one. Does that mean I don't have a right to become a president? You have every right to become a president.\n\nThe other day we were in India festival and Tim Kaine came and obviously we kind of know him from for last association all these years. So we took Medha and had a picture with Tim Kenny. And I said Senator Kaine, this was the newest member in our family and said or the future senator of Virginia. From his perspective, a child can only aspire to become another senator Meda. She will become exactly what her Guna karma is. So Bhagavan said, the Prakriti has created four types of beings at least in the human race with their qualities and their actions are assigned accordingly.\n\nI told you in our architecture firm we're all architects. We come out of architecture college. But then some have design tendency testicle side, some are more on the nitty gritty type construction and details. And there's some purely management. Now if you take the one and assign the other, it's always a disaster. So even though we have abolished the system of design department, production department, we still assign work according to their tendencies.\n\nDoes that mean we are discriminating? No, we are just trying to make people more comfortable in their ability to produce work. So Bhagavan says Brahmanakshatriya Vishaam Sudranam Chaparantapa Karmani Pravibhaktani. So Bhava prabhavaih gunai hi. All these people have own tendencies and the work is distributed in the society according to their qualities born of their own nature, not just somebody instilled by force. There is a lot of social injustice in this world, but that's not Bhagavad Gita is all about Bhagavad Gita.\n\nSays Bhagavad Gita makes a statement of facts how we understand this fact and utilize or misuse our shortcomings and ignorance. So the next verse says Shamah damah Tapaha Shaucham shanti arjavam Gnanam Vignanam Astikyam Brahma Karma svabhavajam Long list. These are the qualities of the scholarly class thinking class in any society whether it is Indian, tribal or somewhere in some distant planet. More evolved society than human beings. Every society in this age or in Rama's age was divided by people who have tendency to be more thinking, contemplating type, knowledge oriented. See those people who have these qualities of serenity, self restraint, austerity, purity, forgiveness and also uprightness, knowledge realization, realization of what is right and wrong.\n\nRealization of what is my true self and what is my non self belief in God Brahma Astikyam have a faith that there is some higher self than my this limited self. The Astikyam Brahma Karma svabhavajam Vajam qualities of the Brahmanas. It does not say the one who was born in Brahmana family or falls into a Brahmana caste simply says that the group of people in any society who have this qualities they fall into this type of activity because of their evolution in their intellectual pursuit. What I know in architecture today is a lot more than I knew in 1970s. My constant working in that field has given me more and more knowledge now. Does that mean that because you should have equal rights that I have to give up my knowledge and act like the guy who comes out of architecture school.\n\nNo, this is with my own effort I have achieved a status which is higher than the guy who comes out of architecture school today. So by their own efforts and evolution the people have achieved the state where they have developed these qualities. And we have seen all we are doing is working in our inner equipment through our actions. There are some actions which purify my inner equipment. There are some actions which will pollute my inner equipment. If my actions were consistently to purify my inner equipment I would have developed these qualities.\n\nAnd those who have done that, they are the Brahmanas. In any society the next we say is Sauryam Tejo Dhrutihi Daksham Yudde Chapyapalayanam Dhanam Ishwara Bhavasta, Kshatram karmasu bhavajam. There are people who are scholarly and they have through their evolution of their mind and intellect reached a point of serenity and clarity that they can see things as they are. And therefore in our all Puranas the king has to go to this Rajguru ask for advice. Because he in his passion may not see what is right or wrong whether to attack that next territory or not. He goes to Rajguru and asks his permission.\n\nRajguru because he's not attached into. He can see things as is and say this is good for you or this is not good for you. This is right or wrong. Because he's devoid of the passion with the King. So the next group of people in any society are the Kshatriyas. We obviously by now know that the Brahminas do the scholarly work.\n\nKshatriyas did the political and protection and administering the country or the kingdom. So their qualities should be prowess, splendor, firmness, dexterity. And also not fleeing from battle, battle of life. Some of us run away from any situation when it is threatening and some will face head on. The quality of Kshatriya is to face that situation head on. Generosity, lordiness, leadership.\n\nToday we call it leadership qualities. I was part of this leadership Metro Richmond group and so was Rajesh. We want to develop leaders in this community so that they can take this community to the next level. I attended one of the seminars and the guy said something which really I thought was pretty neat.

      "commentary": "Chapter 18, moonkanish Sannyasa Yoga. Yoga of Liberation through Renunciation. And we have discussed what this chapter is all about. Whether you can see it as a summary or the final recommendations. You can see it like William Barr's four page summary of 400 page Muller's report. You're trying to make the sense out of it without reading the whole 400 pages.\n\nBefore you heard this argument about what is right, one party says it completely exonerate Trump and other parties. There are some issues here. That's because before reading the 400 pages, you are reading the memo. So here, if you just read chapter 18 by itself, it probably won't make any sense to you. But if you read the entire Bhagavad Gita from chapter one through 17 and then read chapter 18, it should make sense to you. So what we have discussed so far is in Bhagavad Gita, the recommendations are made for your betterment, for your growth, for your happiness in general.\n\nWe have realized that in this world there are people who are different from each other. But each one is striving for the one and the same goal, which is to achieve happiness. Not only just the happiness in a finite term, but infinite term. I want to get happiness which never ends. So we all learned who we are at this limited self, what is our identity, what when we identify with the supreme, and how can we remove this parallax between the limited self and unlimited self to achieve that infinite happiness. So this chapter now brings it back to our attention that what we have discussed.\n\nSo what we have discussed so far is working in this world is absolutely necessary. In this world you will not be able to stand still without acting anything because of our experiences, that anytime I get involved in something and there are conflicts and there are frictions, and therefore it creates unhappiness. Maybe I should stay away from all these things. But once that's not the answer, because you just cannot stay without doing anything. So therefore understand what action is all about. You should not give up actions, but act in accordance with the advice in the Sastra which says that there are actions which are forbidden actions.\n\nIt is not that you and I have to invent the will all over again every time. We have the wisdom of our ancestors, our civilization, our culture which tells you that stay away from this. This is not going to help you. Just like you tell a child, don't put finger in the fire, you're going to get burnt. Don't put finger in the electrical outlet, you'll get shot. You don't have to try it out to see whether it works or not.\n\nSo the Nidya Karma are forbidden. So that you don't get burnt, you don't get completely destroyed. Now what is left is Niyata Karma. In Naimitya Karma, my daily duties and my special duties, those Bhagavan said you should do it with an attitude of non attachment and thou shall achieve your goal of getting happiness. That's basically a simple advice in the beginning. But then the question occurs that we are all of different temperaments and we all have different goals.\n\nWe act in different fields. Is it really applied to all of us or only apply to the great evolved people who have understood all this philosophy of life? And Bhagavan come to the conclusion, a guideline that no. It applies to all of you. Whether you are at the top of the pyramid or at the bottom of the pyramid in the society. Therefore, we have discussed the four types of people.\n\nThis classification which we have just learned in previous verses says there are four types of people. They are defined by their own nature, their own gunas. It does not say that because you are a Brahmana, these gunas are yours. Because you have these Gunas, you'll be considered a Brahmana. You should consider yourself a Brahmana because you have these following gunas. Bravery, valor, brightness, Lordliness.\n\nThen you should be Kshatriya, not other way around. Because you are a Kshatriya, you should have these qualities. Because you have these qualities, you are a Kshatriya. And then because you have these qualities, you are a Vaishya or a Kshatra. It did not say that one class is more important than other. He said it's applicable to all of you.\n\nThe advice given in Bhagavad Gita, whether you are at the lowest rank, at the Shudra level or the Brahmin level, it all will apply to you. So last time somebody asked me, can you make a reference to the Purusha Sukta in Riga Veda. So in Purusha Sukta the same idea is explained. Purusha Sukta starts with Sahastra, Sirisa, Purushaha, Sahastraksha, Sahastrapad. This Purusha is envisioned, is the universal being. If the entire creation is one being, then how will you view it?\n\nOr the sage who saw this universe as one being, he saw him as a being with thousands of eyes and thousands of legs and thousands of mouths. Very similar to what we have learnt in Bhagavad Gita in that vishwarupadas in chapter 11. So he said, this Purusha is everywhere. Sabhumim, Visvatovratva, atyatistha dash Angalam. He's enveloping the entire universe and is spreading in all ten directions. We have discussed before eight cardinal directions.\n\nNorthwest, east, south, northwest, southwest, southeast and northeast. Then eight up and down, 10, he's extending in all 10 directions. And then the question asks, what about his limbs? Brahmano mukha Asita. The first time you hear this Brahmano, Ashya Mukha, Asith, Brahmanas are his mouth. This universal being in his self is envisioned as what coming out of his mouth is Brahmanas.\n\nSo Brahmana, the knowledge speech, what we see is Brahmana, Asya Mukham, Asith, Bahuhu, Rajanya, Kritaha. His arms are made up of Rajanya, Kshatriyas, Uru tadasyat, Vaishyah. His thighs are made up of Vaishyas and Padyam Shudrajaya and his feet are made up of Shudras. The shudras constitute his feet, Vaisyas constitute his thighs, Kshatriyas constitute his arms and Brahmanas his mouth. This being cannot be complete if any one of them. You remove the complete picture of the Supreme Being.\n\nIt cannot be complete if you just take the Brahmanas and say other three are not necessary. He is who he is because all four parts. And then it continues and says Nabya Asid Antariksha. His navel forms the space between the heaven and the earth. Sishnav dyo Samovar Tathaha, his head sustained in heaven. Padma Bhumir Disaha, your feet are sustaining the earth.\n\nNakshatra, Tatha, Lokan Akalbayan and his ears the directions. So basically this one single entity is viewed as encompassing every part of the society, every part of our universe. Brahmanas are his mouth, Kshatriyas are his hands, arms and Vaishyas are his thigh. And shudras are his feet. He's supported by Shudras and Vaishyas. But it is part of the same entity.\n\nSo it's not the intention of the writer of this Purushaktam to put anyone down or so. But basically saying this system just cannot function unless there are all four types of people at any given time, at any given place, in any given society. So therefore we have discussed in this that there are four types of people. You may fall in any one of them depending on your qualities. If you find your qualities to be of service, your Shudra and as we said, entire service sector now today can be part of Shudras. Because we are serving.\n\nServing is the nature of Shudras. Creating wealth is the nature of Vaishyas. If you put the Vaishyas where the Rajanya is supposed to be, that happens. What is happening in USA now? So Bhagawan said that each one has own quality. And when you try to mix each other without understanding, it may create issues and problems.\n\nBut if you understand yourself where you stand, at least at your level. This Bhagavad Gita is for the self unfoldment for individuals self development. Therefore, if you understand so the next four verses from 45 through 48 are actually the essence of how to be successful. So if we forget the entire message of Bhagavad Gita, but understand these four verses and contemplate on it and practice Bhagavan guarantees that you will be a happy person and you will be a successful person. These verses are applicable to all four classes of people. Not just for the Brahmins, and not just for Kshatriyas or Vaishyas, but even Kshudras, all four of them.\n\nIf they can stick to this formula of success, then success is guaranteed. That's basically what these four verses are all about. Verse 45th, which we have seen, says. The first statement of fact devoted to one's own duty. A man attains perfection. Perfection should not be taken.\n\nIs realization that now I have realized what myself is. Whatever the field you're practicing, if you stay within your own nature, you will achieve perfection in that. If I'm a sweeper, if I focus into it, I'll achieve perfection. They always wonder, well, all these people who have this garbage collection company, I mean, at some point the guy had some interest in garbage collection. Right before he became big businessman. Has lots of trucks running around all over Richmond.\n\nYou can't suddenly get interested into garbage collection. I actually had a client one time with one of this recycling business, just passing through his yard, all junk all around it. Then you go to his office, which is an air conditioned. Nice little office, nice little conference room. But just going through that made me realize that this guy must be really feeling comfortable in this environment. Therefore, he can be a successful businessman trading in this recycling business.\n\nBhagavan said, wherever you feel comfortable, according to your own dharma. If you follow the actions. If you perform actions in your own field of interest. Sansiddhim Labate Naraha person gets success. That's as simple as that. If I try to do something which is not my nature, I may get some success here and there.\n\nBut I'll never get full success. I tried developing some hotels and lost my shirt. But designing hotels I do very well. So after I lost all my investment, I said, let me go back to what I do best. Keep designing for other people. I can give advice to other people.\n\nWhere to build hotels, what is the right location, what will work, what will not work. I tried to do it myself. The Bhagavan said, if you stay within your realm of interest, of your own nature, success is guaranteed. You will achieve success. Swag karma nirataha Siddhim Yatha Vindha di tatsurana. But how that happens?\n\nBhagawan said, I'll tell you now how working in the field of your own interest, one can get. Siddhim perfections, success, expertise, you know. And we find in this world that all kinds of experts. Every time I come across a new challenge in my profession with something which I never heard about. Somebody says design something and say it requires something so unique. How do I figure this thing out?\n\nAnd then I realized that there are experts in that even there is a disaster. They will maybe find that suddenly that there are experts in this world who deal with that type of disaster which we have never thought about that. How can you have experts in that field when the disaster only occurs once in a. So there are people who find their niche and they become expert because they pursue field of their interest. As simple as Bhagavanji, how they do it, Bhagavanji, I will explain to you now. So the next three verses.\n\nThis simply says how you should view your own field of interest.",

Having done what you can, release the outcome.\n\nToday, identify one situation where you're holding on too tightly. Practice opening your hands.

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 18, Moksha Sannyasi Yoga, Yoga of Liberation through renunciation, renunciation of actions. And therefore up till now we have discussed the nature of actions, nature of actors, the that is you and I and the nature of knowledge. Knowledge that propels my desires and my desires prompts me to act. And I go and act in this world outside. So we have analyzed how we function in this world. We came to the conclusion that depending on the texture of my mind and intellect, whether it is Sattvik, Rajaseek or Tamasvik that's dependent on my tendencies.\n\nIf my tendencies are Sattvik, I will have Satwik desires and I will do Satwik actions. If it is Rajasek, the same and the Tamasic appropriately. So my tendencies are driving my actions. And these actions come reactions from the world and I react to that and become my actions. This cycle continues as long as I have the sense of doership. And then Bhakti Bhava, which is the sense of enjoyership.\n\nI am the doer and I'm enjoyer. And therefore we have analyzed in detail what is the nature of the action, which is the nature of the actor. What is the nature of knowledge? So the prescription we have seen in the last verse we had been discussing says Sahajam Karma Kaunteya, do the actions which come naturally to you? Because after analyzing all these actions we get confused. Maybe the only Sattvic actions should be done.\n\nI should give up all the Rajasic and Tamasic actions. But that's not possible for any one of us. Because what we don't have control over is our tendencies. Because the tendencies came from my past experiences. I do not have any control over my past. I have control over my present and I don't have any control over my future.\n\nBut my present actions can determine what my future can be. I don't have control of the past. I can control the present to control my future. So therefore Bhagavan says after knowing all this, that the actions and actors can be Satvika, Raja, Sikh and Tamastik and their consequences, the results of those actions. So what am I supposed to do, Bhagavan? Bhagavan said, sahajam Karma Kaunteya.\n\nYou do the actions which come naturally to you at this time because you have these accumulated vasanas and tendencies which you cannot get rid of them overnight or just because I read Bhagavad Gita for half an hour in the morning. So Bhagavan said, do the actions which come naturally to you, Sahajam Karma Kaunteya, not the ones which I find to. Be the best actions to perform in this field or in this environment, but that which comes natural to me due to my tendencies of my mind and my intellect. Sadoshamma Pin Natya Jat. Now I come to the conclusion that my desire is to do designs for buildings. But then the clients come to me.\n\nTheir actions may have some defects. I had clients which had Togo companies. I have casinos as my client and I even had a strip club as my client. In 2001, we were in downtown Brook Binder building and there was a strip club on Brook Road. And they called us up and said, somebody recommended your name and we need your help in doing some modifications to our club because there's some code violations. So my staff who fielded the phone came to Neil, this is a problem.\n\nI don't think you're going to allow it. I said, of course I'm going to allow you. Client is a form of God. Gandhiji said, Gandhiji said, Grahaka Iti Bhagavan something representative. I said, our job is to fix the code violations, Go and find out what the code violations are, figure out what needs to be done, give them appropriate drawing and make sure the code violations are mitigated. What he does is between him and his Bhagavan.\n\nWhat I do is between I and my Bhagavan. My Bhagavan says, your job as an architect to make sure if a client comes to you to get his building more in line with the local codes, you need to help him. Even they are with defect should not be given up. Because imagine if all architects say, well, we are not helping any strip clubs anymore, what happens? It will be a building with full of fire violation, code violence, dangerous for the society. So Bhagawan said, even your actions, they seem to have defects but because they come naturally to you, should not be given up.\n\nSarva Arambahi Doshena Dumena Agnihi Ava Vritaha all actions, aramba in this case means actions. And Swamiji clarifies what is considered as arambha. I'm doing that because of I want to do it to fulfill my desire. Any ayramba will have its own defects. Any medication will have its own side effect. Any action which is prompted by your desire will have its own side effects.\n\nSo Bhagavan said that's given that the nature of any action. Therefore even if you find that something you are doing out of your nature and find a fault in it, you should not give up. Because every action if you analyze will have its own defects. Domena agnihi awa vritaha Just as every fire will have smoke, some may have more smoke, some fire, some may have very little. But there is smoke because there is no combustion that we know of in our day to day life which is hundred percent combustion. Therefore there will be smoke.\n\nBut that does not mean that you give up lighting fire when you need it. Therefore you should continue to perform actions which comes naturally to you even though they may have defects. Now if I work in this world in that manner, what should I expect? Bhagwant, what happens is when you are aligning your actions with your nature that ego pressure will reduce. And all the problems we see in our life is because that ego egocentric actions. But something which comes naturally to me when I do it, there will not be any ego pressure.\n\nAnd therefore you will gradually become asaktabuddhehe. Your intellect will become unattached. Something which come naturally to you when you do it. There is very little ego involved in it. And therefore you don't get attached to that. Sarvatra, your intellect become unattached in all actions that you perform which comes naturally to you.\n\nBecause now your intellect is not attached. It's not creating more vasanas. Where we create more vasanas is we. Are now getting polluted by the experience in this field. I go to the mall and all I want to do is buy one thing. But while I'm there I get affected by the environment.\n\nI went to the list of 10. Items and I came back with 18 items. Because that's how the environment affect us. If I'm consciously working in tune with my own nature then I will be least affected by the environment. Therefore I will have the least creation of new vasanas. In a new vasana, pressure will be at minimum.\n\nSo I will be Jitatma. I Will control over myself. Now anytime we say this self is my. My mind and my intellect and my senses. So jitatma vigathas pruhaha will become without any desires. Now this may be very difficult for us to grasp.\n\nBut more and more you are functioning in line with your nature. And therefore you are going to get success in that field. You have a less and less desire of doing something which is not in line with your nature. So therefore you become vigadas prohaha without any additional desire. I'm exhausting my past vasanas which has created my tendencies that has put me into this field of activities. I'm exhausting my past vasanas by doing so.\n\nAnd therefore I'm getting least and least attached to my actions. And when I exhaust those vasanas, I'll have less and less desires. Because I'm only focused on the what I like. Niskarima siddhiyam paramam sanyasena adigachati. What was my final goal is to renounce actions. But right now, because of my past vasanas and the vasana pressures and my tendencies, I cannot renounce them.\n\nSo Bhagavan said, go ahead and act in this field which is in tune with your true nature. By doing so you will get less and less the sense of doership and sense of enjoyership. And therefore those actions you will not take credit or blame for it. You will say this is what I do and this is what I wanted to do and I did it. What came out of it was not in my hand. More and more you give up that sense of doership.\n\nActions become non actions because you're not taking any credit for it. If you act on behalf of your company and things go completely wrong. But you did it exactly as per your company's. Whatever the policies and what your job description calls for. But things went wrong. Would you be totally worried about that?\n\nThat's company's problem. Why did they have this wrong policy? They asked me to do this. I as a project manager or the vp, I did. That happens to be the wrong policies. As long as you thought that you took the decision and I was guiding the company's policy then you are in problem.\n\nYou are working on behalf of the company. What you do is strictly company's liability. You do something and something goes wrong, it's still the company's liability. Even though Bhagavan has given all these capabilities, us, we take the responsibility and therefore we suffer for it. So Bhagavan said, when you Reach a point, your actions become natural. And therefore you're not taking the creditor of blame for it and offer everything to him who has given you this talent.\n\nSo Bhagavan said, as long as you recognize that most of your ability to function in this world has come in spite of you and that sense will give you a nice Karmya Siddhm that you will reach a state of actionlessness. And if you say that's what we were trying to do in the first place, I was working towards my retirement, right? All this 401k and all this I'm putting together. For my retirement actionless state Niskarma Siddhimparamam. He achieves the highest state of actionlessness. And therefore sanyasena adhi gachadi.\n\nAnd therefore he renounces all the sense of doership and enjoyership and achieves the highest state of complete bliss. The next verse says Siddhim Prapto Yatha Brahma Tata Apnoti Nibodhame Samase Naivakante Nishtha Gnanasya Yapara. We have come full circle. We have understood who we are, how we work in this world. And we also got the prescription of Bhagavan. So now Bhagavan said, okay, now that he understood all of that.\n\nNow if you follow this advice, then what will happen? Siddhim Prapto yatha Brahma Tatha Apnoti Nibodhame ultimate goal was to reach the state of infiniteness. One with the Supreme Self. Why do I want to be one with the supreme self? Because the limited self is not giving me joy and happiness. Therefore I want to not.\n\nI'm doing a favor to Supreme. I'm joining your party. This state is not giving me joy and happiness which I'm looking for. So I want to achieve a state which can give me joy and happiness. And at that state, by all accounts we have seen is the only one state, the state of the Supreme Being. So everyone is knowingly or unknowingly trying to achieve that.\n\nWe are failing and then going in circles. The Bhagavan says, let me tell you, it's a very simple and clear path. Act according to your nature. Do not do anything which is contrary to your nature. Because that will complicate your life, will create more unnecessary vasanas, unnecessary desires and then unnecessary actions.",

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 18, Moksa Sannyasa Yoga, Yoga of Liberation through Renunciation. So so far we have seen that we are the product of our past and therefore we have tendencies and likings and dislikings. And all the discussion so far was about Sattva. Rajasant Tamas, this is Sattvik, this is Rajasik Sidi. So natural tendency to think is, well, I'll pick the best which I can find in this. Well, this looks like Sattva, so I'll just do Sattvik only thing.\n\nBut our tendencies and our desires and the coloring of our mind won't let us do that. So the advice from Bhagavan is Sahajam Karma kontea sadoshena PI Natya Jat. Do the actions which come naturally to you. That something which is in line with your own personality, your tendencies, your likings, your dislikings. Do those actions even though you find them to be with defects. Because I have learned 17 chapters of Bhagavad Gita Nav and suddenly I find that, oh, most of my actions are Raju Sikh.\n\nThat's your nature right now that comes naturally to you. That's where the Bhagavad Gita started. Bhagavan said to Arjuna, you are a warrior. The Rajasic action is your nature in the Kshatriya. You can't give it up right now, run towards jungle to meditate, because that will be against your tendencies in nature. That will actually create more harm to your path of evolution than help you.\n\nIt won't purify your mind, pollute your mind and confuse your mind. So Sahajam Karma kaun teja sadoshana pen Natya Jat. Do not give up the actions which come naturally to you. Even though you find some defects, they are not perfect. And then Bhagavan said that by doing so you will purify yourself and consolation given to Sarvarambahi kadushena dumena agnihi ava vritaha all actions, no matter how pure you see them have some defects. There is always a side effect to even the best medicine you can take.\n\nThe Bhagavan said Any actions which you have to perform in accordance with your nature even if you find the faults in it, continue. Because every action will have its own defects. But then what do I do with it? The only thing you can do is perfect your attitude towards your actions. Actions by nature has their own pluses and minuses but you can change your attitude towards your actions. So the next few verses which we have seen say Asakta Buddhe first thing you do is detach your intellect from your actions.\n\nAsaktabuddhi Sarvatrajit Mah Vigathaspruhaha I'm doing these things because that comes naturally to me. Therefore I'm doing it. As I said Gita class is a kamyakarma for me. Because I like to do is my desire to do it. If it comes naturally to you, do it. Bhagavan said But Asaktabuddhehe detach your mind and intellect from those actions.\n\nSarvatrajitmaha Jeeta TMH have self control Self control on your desires and your likings and dislikes. I'm doing it But I may not have any control of the outcome of this thing. I may not be allowed to do these things. The environment, the situation may not allow me to do this. I need to be content with that without any desires I want to do it. But if there is no opportunity to do it.\n\nI'll continue what is available to me. The goal here is to achieve a state of Naiskarma Siddhyam Whatever I do, I do not feel that I'm doing it. As I said, when we are working on our hobbies it's not work. I'm putting lots of efforts But I don't consider it as work because that's my hobby. The other day Krishna told me I'm going to call you. We're going to pray practice together.\n\nBecause it's not working when we are not practicing. When are you going to call me? Well, Saturday I'm not available because that becomes work for me. Naiskarma Siddhi is like. When everything I do becomes my hobby I become actionless. It's all basically in line with my my nature.\n\nParamam sanyasena digha de Such a person achieves that highest level of renunciation. By doing things which you are supposed to do, you can achieve sannyasa. You have seen the definition of sannyasa is what giving up the sense of agency is sannyasa. Not giving up things and beings is sannyasa giving up the sense of agency. I am doing it and I am enjoying it. When you give up, you are a sannyasi.\n\nBhagavan said, if you do all the things in line with your nature, you will never have that sense of agency, neither will you even notice that you are enjoying it. You get so engrossed in the stuff which you do for your hobby that neither you are aware that you are putting lots of efforts into it, nor whether it's painful or enjoyable. Music practice was the most painful thing I had when I was going to my teachers classes for little time. But it was still what I wanted to do. So whether it was a pain or a joy, I never noticed it. This is something I want to do.\n\nThat Bhagavan says in neither you are aware that you are the doer nor you are aware that you are the enjoyer. That state when you achieve, you achieved a sannyasa Bhagwan sahib. With that the next verse says Siddhim prapto yatha brahma tatha apnoti nibodame sama se nay kaunteya nista gnana seya yapara. Now I'll tell you in brief. Having achieving that siddhi. The nice karma siddhi.\n\nThen now everything comes naturally to me. I do everything naturally. I don't have any anxiety about whether I'm enjoying or suffering through it or good will come out. I just enjoy doing it. Therefore I'm doing it. He said, achieving that siddhi in your actions.\n\nAnd then you have achieved the sannyasa by that. How you can achieve the Brahman by doing so that I will tell you now. So now comes the prescription or the detailed guidance of how to achieve that. The verse we have seen after that is Buddaya visuddaya Yuktah dhruti atmanam niyam yucha. First thing is to Buddaya Visudhya you have to purify your intellect. My intellect is right now polluted by my ego.\n\nMy ego said I am always right even though everybody says that. But my intellect I am smartest among all. So Buddhaya Vishuddaya, the purified intellect will See things as is. Dhruti Atman Intellect is purified by not having ego polluting it. This is what I want to do. This is what I like to do.\n\nAnd this is where I am putting my efforts. Dhruti Atmanam firm in your own self. What is my true nature? I know what I really like. I was just listening to NPR yesterday and some guy who was a lawyer and has a nice corporate practice, he gives up and becomes a LEGO artist. I don't know whether anybody heard that.\n\nIn other words, he makes complex form of lions and stuff. He's basically an artist whose work is now displayed all these places. But he gave up the job and became a LEGO artist. And LEGO company provides him free logos. When they have a new LEGO comes out in thousands and he creates whatever. He said that the worst day as an artist is better than the best day as a lawyer.\n\nFor me, therefore I did it. He found what he likes. He followed Bhagavad Gita without reading it. I want to do this no matter what the outcome may be. But this is what I like. Buddaya Visuddhaya Having purified my intellect, what is my true nature?\n\nOur intellect typically gets polluted by what others will think about me by doing so. And therefore we are doing it. We choose our profession. At least in my time it was very simple. You don't have to figure out what you like. If you don't get an admission in medicine, go to chemical engineering.\n\nChemical engineering. Go to mechanical engineering. Mechanical engine doesn't work out. Electrical last civil. And now if you are completely out of that, go to architecture. You didn't have to figure out what you like.\n\nYou just figure out what the social scale is. Bhagavan said that's a perfect recipe for disaster for you. Dhruti Atmanam Niyamyacha Sabdayati Visayam Tektva Ragadveso, vidashyacha sabdadi sound, etc. In other words, all the sense objects from outside which is polluting your mind and intellect. You are not getting disturbed by this. I wish I can become an artist but there is no money in it.\n\nDoctors make more money. So let me go to medicine even though I hate that profession. There was one guy on Kaun Banega Karorpathi. I have just done my internship and Amitabh Bachchan asked him. So after that, what is he? He Said, what do you mean?\n\nDon't you want to do MD or Ms. Or something? He said, yeah, I can do MD or ms, but I'm not interested in it. He said, why are you not interested in furthering your career? He said, I don't like medicine. My parents wanted me to go to medicine. That's why I went to medicine.\n\nBut I want to be an IAS officer. I've seen IAS officers. I've seen what they do and their power and their influence. And that's what I want to be. So I did what my parents wanted to do. I'm now going to do what I want to do.\n\nAnd how do I achieve this? Vivekta sevi Lagvasi now this comes the discipline or a guidance how you can find out what you really like. How do you find out what your true nature is? How do I align my actions with my own nature? Vivekta sevi Solitude. Solitude is something we think.\n\nWe are all afraid of loneliness. If you don't, I'll tell you. When we were young, if Saturday you have no invitation to go to any party. But we don't know what to do. Neil, what are you doing over the weekend? So Neil, how was your weekend?\n\nI said, it's always the same. My weekends are always the same. Which party did you go? If you don't get invited to a party, you don't know what to do with your life. That weekend I'm completely lost. Learn to be happy with yourself.\n\nFind a way that you can enjoy solitude. That you think, thank God nobody is now here. I can be by myself and enjoy my time. I'm sure most of your parents went through that. But solitude is a practice to figure out how you can enjoy yourself by yourself. Lagwasi Eating but little other text says eat as much as you eat.\n\nYour medicine, medication. You never take more than what your doctor says you should take. One tablet means one tablet. That's what doctor said, right? Not if the doctors say one. But I'm a little more aggressive about it.\n\nI'm going to take three at a time. Take only what you need. You see, your food should be just like that. Your food should also be what you need. And then it elaborately described that quarter of your belly should be filled with your food. Quarter you leave a place for the water and half you leave for air.\n\nThat much you should eat la gvasi because you know that when you're overstuffed, you're uncomfortable and mind is not available for anything else. Because you're uncomfortable about your own body. Lagwasi yat vak kayamanasaha Control over your speech, body and mind. Swamiji explains here that wak speech includes all organs of action. Basically it's an indicator. All the organs of action should be in control.\n\nDoes not say stop them in control. Moderation Kaya Body. Body is the gross form of my mind.",
      "reflection": "The Gita's final teaching is surrender. Not passive resignation, but active trust. Having done what you can, release the outcome.\n\nToday, identify one situation where you're holding on too tightly. Practice opening your hands. Let it be what it will be.\n\nArjuna's journey from paralysis to clarity, from confusion to conviction, is available to each of us. The teaching has been given. What remains is to live it."

      "commentary": "Okay, we had been discussing chapter 18, Moksha Sannyasi, yoga, Yoga of Liberation through Renunciation. And we are literally coming to the end of Bhagavan's advice in this chapter. So in the beginning, obviously, we have seen that the goal of life is to achieve permanent happiness. And we have heard from our scriptures that the only way one can achieve that perfect happiness is either one becomes a sannyasi or a yogi. Everyone else is in the rut of life. And therefore, if that's your goal, to achieve that permanent happiness, you have to either become a sannyasi or a yogi.\n\nSo the chapter opened with the definition of sannyasi and yogi. The one who has renounced the sense of I am the doer, the agency is the sannyasi, and who is yogi? The one who has given us the fruits of actions. Desire for the fruits of actions is a yogi. So either I have to become a sanyasi or a yogi to achieve that permanent happiness. And then the obviously prescription came.\n\nIt is easier for us to give up the fruits of actions than giving up the sense of agency. Ego is so entrenched in my personality right now that for me to think I'm not doing it is more difficult. I must at least give up the expectations for desired results of my actions. I can start with that. If I have to do that, I first have to understand what is action and how it is done, what is my involvement in performing my actions. So we have this detailed analysis of what is action, what is an actor, and what propels that action.\n\nThe knowledge propels my actions. My knowledge about myself and this world, my relationship with this world drives me to act in this world. So we have detailed analysis of these three, the action, the actor, and the knowledge. We have seen that all of these three are driven by the texture of my mind. My mind has either a sattvic, Rajasic or tamasic tendencies that will make me either a sattvic actor, Rajasic actor, tamasic actor, that will drive me to the sattvic actions, rajasic actions or tamasic actions. So the texture of my mind is the basis for my life.\n\nWho I am today is a reflection of my mind. With my self introspection I may come to a conclusion. That makeup of my mind is this. Right now I'm 20% sattvic, 60% Rajasic and 20% tamasic. I really don't have a choice to change that overnight. Just because I go to a doctor to get my blood work done which I do every four months and they say your cholesterol is too high, triglycerides are way out of control.\n\nJust knowing that I will not be able to change it right away. Neither there is any magical bullet where I can say I will change that overnight. But I can start on a course of action course of action which my doctors constantly, every four months remind me. I remember first month, but three months I take it easy. And as soon as the fourth month comes, I'm vigilant again. I have to be in that prescribed method consistently.\n\nSo the first thing is I have to accept my condition. I have to accept that I have the high cholesterol and high triglycerides and I have this propensity to get a heart attack and all that. If I deny that, if I'm in a denial, that's all, that's not for a long time I'll deny blood pressure. I go to my one doctor, my blood always comes out right. I go to anywhere else, my blood pressure is very high. So I go to the insurance company, they check and say your blood is high.\n\nI said, no, no, you are wrong. Let me go back to my doctor, I'll check it out. For some reason it worked. Every time I go there, my blood pressure is normal. I go anywhere else, my blood pressure is not normal. So I was in a complete denial that I have high blood pressure.\n\nFinally I had to accept that I probably have high blood pressure. So first is acceptance that I may have this condition. Conditioning which I see as myself is not in my control. It was in my control at one point of time, but it has now become past. So I have now become who I am because of all my past experiences and actions. And I accept that now I have to work on it.\n\nSo first thing I have to do is what comes naturally to me at this time and then take it from there what my goal would be. So Bhagavan said, now if your goal is to achieve the permanent happiness you have come to the Conclusion. This is the makeup of your mind. The advice is Sahajam karma kaunteya sudo shena pin natya jat. Do the actions which comes naturally to you even though they are imperfect. My chosen field of action may not be the most popular, the most appreciated.\n\nBut that's what my nature is. I like carpentry and I want to be a carpenter. I like arts and I want to be an artist. They always have this hungry artists exhibitions because artists go hungry. But that's the chosen field comes naturally to me. The Bhagavan said, sahajam karma kaunteya sadosha bin natya jat.\n\nYou cannot give up the field of actions which come naturally to you. First advice, Clear guidance. Stay in the field which comes naturally to you and then go from there. So the next advice is then. Okay, Now I have figured out what my natural field of action is. But how should I act so that I'll get the benefit of that?\n\nThe next thing is Asaktah jitatma. Without attachment and without any expectation. We have seen there are only two paths. Either to become a Sanyasi or a yogi. Yogi is the one who gives up Karma Phala. I found field of my actions.\n\nI'm ready to now launch my career in that field or my endeavors. Without any expectation. I will do what I like in the best I can. What comes out of my actions is not in my control. Because I am not the Karma Faladatta. Karma Faladatta is always the word, the ishvara, somebody other than me.\n\nI need to leave it to them their duties to perform diligently. I will perform my duty diligently. The Bhagavan said, perform your actions without attachment expectations in the field which comes naturally to you. Doing so, you will develop devotion for me. You will align your thoughts with the one who empowers you to do these actions. So therefore he said, become one with me.\n\nOffer everything to me. And the last few verses which you have seen. He says, bhaktiya mam abhijanati yavat na aschasmi tatvatah tatomam tattvato gnatva visatei tad anantharam. Just by acting in this manner of offering everything to him. As we have seen in detail the previous verses, once I decided the field of my actions, I decided that I am not really the one who empowers me to act. The consciousness functioning through me as my life empowers me to act.\n\nI'll be only able to conduct Gita classes as long as I'm alive. The day I drop dead, Gita classes will be history. That's because my consciousness in me allows me to understand Bhagavad Gita. So the empowering authority is something other than me. That which connects the electricity in this room is the empowering authority for the electricity. We have lights, we have air conditioning.\n\nRight now we are pretty happy. Things are working fine. They rented the place. Electricity wasn't there. He thought, I am the Almighty for this place. Calls me up and says, not working.\n\nI said, I think the machine is not working. Electricity is not connecting through Dominion Virginia Power. Dominion Virginia Power is the final authority that the electricity comes here. I have a limited power to turn the switch on and off when I need that. But in that limited power, I start thinking because it is always there. I think I am in control and I can turn this thing on and off.\n\nIt is only when the power goes out I realize I am just a Nimitta Matra. Virginia Power decides whether I have electricity or not. As long as that electricity is functioning through this space, I can control this space. When Dominion Virginia Power connection is disconnected, no matter how many times I turn the switch on and off, nothing happens. Bhagavan said, you need to recognize this fact that you are connected to me as the supreme consciousness which is functioning through you. If you keep that in mind all the time, they will make sure that that connection never gets disconnected.\n\nSee, when I design buildings, most buildings have normal electricity connection. And then when there is power outage, the connection goes out. But I designed the emergency shelter. Actually medical examiner's office in downtown. Well, you can't have the power go out during emergency. That is the time when there's a disaster.\n\nThat's the time that office becomes most active. They may have all these disaster victims coming to this place. Those pathologists have to work overnight to deal with them. So you need to have a dual power system for that. We connected that building from two different grids. So even though one grid is out, the other grid is connected.\n\nThey will never be out of that electrical connection. That's where you will have this permanent connection. Bhagavan said, if you want eternal happiness, you need to make sure that your connection to me is always connected. And for that, you have to offer everything that you do to me. Remembering constantly that I can only do this because he's functioning through me. With that attitude, you will develop devotion for him.\n\nYou will be constantly attached to him. So we both have to have that dual connection. Bhagavan has to have connection with me and I have to have connection with him. That connection when developed, we call it devotion. It's one that devotion takes place. Bhakti mam Avijanati Yavatna Asha asmi Tattvatahara Tatotam tattvoto Gnatva visate tat Anantaram.\n\nBy devotion he knows me in essence. Once I become identified completely with someone or something, I know that thing or being in its essence or his essence. He forthwith enters into me the supreme. Once I completely identify myself with the supreme self, I enters into him. In other words, I become one with that supreme being. Sarvakarmani API sada Kurvanaha mat vyapaasrayah mat prasadat avapnothi Saswatam padam avyayam.\n\nThe process took place. I gave up identification with my ego. I chose the field of my actions. I started working in the field of my actions without any expectations and offered all my actions to him. Now with that connection I have identified completely with him. So now my life is doing all actions always taking refuge in him with his grace.\n\nNow I have not become happy with my efforts. I have become peaceful and happy with his grace. This space is properly conditioned and littered up right now. Grace of Dominion Virginia Power. When their grace is taken away from me, this light will go away and this air conditioning will go away. As long as I recognize that the lights and air conditioning not because of me, because I'm paying the bills but because of their grace that they have connected their electricity to this space then I will be fine.\n\nThen I'll develop that devotion to Dominion Virginia Power. As soon as the bill comes, pay the bill. Bhagavan said, one who becomes one with me, with this root of actions he has become one with me and therefore he achieves that Saswatam Padam avyayam.",

      "commentary": "Discussing chapter 18, Moksha Sannyasa yoga Yoga of Liberation to Renunciation so we are at the conclusion of Bhagavad Gita and in this chapter Bhagawan stated few simple facts which we already know. We have discussed before and also we experienced in our life something as simple as in this world People have different temperaments. Not all people are alike. Each one has his or her own temperament. Depending on that temperament, he may be good at one thing or other. Everybody is not good at everything, but depending on your temperament you may be good at something.\n\nAnd also this temperament will make you like some things and dislike other things. So this temperament is your own nature or your personality. Therefore, because in this world the different people have different personalities, different temperaments, they do different things. Some are good at scholarly pursuits and some are good at doing heroic things and some are good at creating wealth and some are just happy serving others, you may find yourself to be somewhere in this spectrum. Not everybody likes same type of coffee. Some like strong, some like very mild.\n\nOthers may be somewhere in between. So you will find yourself somewhere in the spectrum of temperament. Some are very sattvic, some are very tamasic and most of us are somewhere in between. Therefore find out what your real nature is. Bhagawan said this is a fact that each one has his or her own qualities and temperaments. So depending on your temperament, now you have to find the field of activity which is appropriate for you.\n\nSo earlier in the chapter three Bhagavan said Swadharma Nidhanam, Shreya Paradharma, Vayavah Death. Working in your own nature is better because others Dharma is frightening. If you try to do something against your nature then it will be very frightening. You always fish out of water. You are very artistic person and you want to run a business. You will fish out of water.\n\nYou will not feel comfortable. So therefore find your own Dharma and then work in it. So in this chapter again he reminds us what is good for you. So he said that Sriyan Swadharmo Vigunaha, Paradharma, Swanushti daat. Your Dharma alone is good for you, even though it has faults. It may not be as pristine as others, but this is what your nature is and it is good for you.\n\nAnd therefore Sahajam, Karma, kaunteh. So find the field of activities which come naturally to you. Do the activities which come naturally to you. You shall not incur any sin in doing so. You shall not incur any sin. Continue doing what you like, what comes naturally to you.\n\nAnd do not worry about whether I'll incur any sin or I'll incur any wrong tendencies. We have learnt in the previous chapter that no matter what your tendencies are and what activities you are performing, you start with Om Tatsat, purify them. So in chapter 17 we have learned that no matter what your Saddha is, whether it is Sattvic, whether it is, whether it is Raja Sikh, whether it is Tamasic, you are acting in that manner. But rather than worrying about Vedram, Satvik, Rajesh, Tamasik, do whatever is natural to you. But whatever you do, start with Aum. Every activity which you do, remember him, that he is almighty and all pervading.\n\nAnd he is enabling me to do this activity. So start with Om and say end with Tat, that this is not for me, this is for you. There is nothing that I am doing it for myself because I am not even capable of doing anything. He is all pervading and everything I am doing, I am offering to him because he made me do this. So Bhagawan said, with that attitude, when you perform any actions in the field of your liking which come naturally to you, you will find your happiness. We try everything and we get frustrated.\n\nThat's because we say, one, you are not pursuing your own Dharma and secondly, you think you are doing it for yourself. Those two things, if you correct, find the field of activities which is which is natural to you. And then don't expect anything from it. Then Bhagavan said that you will be relieved from these sorrows and unhappiness. In spite of all this diversity which we see in this world, there is a profound unity. Iswarahas, Sarvabhutanam, Prudeshe, Arjuna, Tisthati.\n\nHe said, why you should offer everything to him and and remember him. And all the time, even though you find yourself to be very different than others, even though you find all these people are very different from each other, there's one Thing very common. They are all functioning because of that one single principle functioning through them. There are no several consciousnesses that mine is different than yours, yours is different than hers, Nurse is different than him. One consciousness functioning through all. Depending on the quality of the equipment, outer behavior will be different from each other.\n\nJust as we have used these examples many many times. This room space is dependent on the conditioning. How far the walls are from each other and how far the ceiling is from the floor. But the space is the same space as it is outside. The space outside and space inside is no different same. All pervading space is in each room in this universe.\n\nWherever you find a space which is confined by limitations, the space is universal. The same way I said that. Isvara Sarva Bhutanam Rudeshe Tishtati the core of all being is the Ishvara Himself is residing because of his presence. Only things are functioning. But how they are functioning. Brahmayan Sarva Bhutani Yantra Rudhani Maya by his illusive power Maya everyone is functioning in this world.\n\nThey are functioning because of Iswara's presence and his power of Maya. The elusive power Brahmayan Sarvabhoot are Yantra Rudhani. It seems like they are just mounted on a machine, helpless to act in this world. We are driven by our own likes and dislikes and vasanas almost compulsively. Whether we like it or not. We see something which is of our liking, we will be attracted towards it.\n\nSomething which is of not conducive, we will be staying away from it. Bhagavan said everybody is propelled by this Maya as if they are helpless. But at the core of all being, Ishvara is the cause for all beings functioning in this world. Keep that unity in mind. So this is a profound revelation. We knew that everybody is different from each other.\n\nEveryone has their own qualities. Everyone has their liking and disliking. Everyone has their own talents. But see, what is common is the cause for all the talents and all the liking and all the disliking is that all pervading principle. The Ishvara, the Lord himself. So Brahman, the all pervading self, with his power of Maya becomes the almighty Creator Ishwara.\n\nWith this Maya, he creates this world of plurality. So I myself, with my power of dreaming, I create my own world of dream. While I'm dreaming, I'm by myself. Even the dream is me. The people in the dream is me. In the dreamer himself is also me.\n\nThere is no other entity. Only when I wake up, I realize that there are not too many people around. There were no different sceneries around. So this is like it is in Ishwara's mind, a great dream. So therefore he said Brahmayan Sarva Bhutani Yantra Rudhani Maya. By this elusive power of Ishvara, each individual in this world is functioning compulsively.\n\nDriven by their own temperaments and qualities. So therefore he says Tamevasharanam gacha. So now they advise you, understood that the people will be different. So you are different from everybody else. Do not try to compare yourself with others and don't try to copy them. You find your own bearings and what is good for you, what you like.\n\nContinue functioning. Except keep the Lord in mind that he is Almighty. He is making me do all these things and therefore I am offering everything I do to Him. Tamevasharanam gacha. Take refuge in that Ishvara, that Almighty, all pervading consciousness. Sarva bhavena Bharata in all your being, with all your thoughts, even thinking about your professional thoughts, your relationships, everything.\n\nWhile you are thinking, put him in the center of it all these things are only possible because of Him. Take refuge in him that you are the ones who is enabling me to function in this world as an individual. Tat Prasada paramsanthim Sthanam prapsi Saswatam. If you take refuge in him with all your being, with all your thoughts, no matter what that is, offer it to him that I can only think this way because of you. I can only act this way because of you. Once you start assigning all credits to him, then you are relieved.\n\nYou have no responsibilities. So in the end Bhagavan said this individualized ego which is identifying with this body, mind and intellect and taking credit for what I'm doing, thinking that I'm the doer. If you just keep that aside, do everything that you are doing right now exactly as you are doing. Because you are doing it as per your nature. You are propelled by your nature to do it. If you try to resist your nature, you are a distortion, a mental disease.\n\nSo keep doing what you are doing. Just keep in mind Tamevasharanam Gacha, Sarva Bhavya Bharata. Just take refuge in Him. Make your identification with him versus this limited body, mind and intellect. Tat prasadat paramshantin sthan praapasi Saswatam. The grace is when the identification is complete then I obviously become one with him, his qualities become my qualities.\n\nI start thinking I have now an access to his capacities. You joined a company a day before and from next day onwards you're part of the company. All the resources of the company. You take the brochure of the company and go to a new client and say I represent IBM. All the IBM's resources are your resources. Now before that, a day before, when you have not joined the company yet, you didn't have that brochure from IBM with you.\n\nYou are just an individual. You can say I can do this and that doesn't really mean much. Once you attached the resources of the Great, all his resources, your resources, all the qualifications of that company become your qualifications. Once you identify with him and take refuge in him Tat Prasad with his grace you will achieve that Santisthanam Propyasi Sastvatam. You will find that eternal peace and a firm abode. All you have to do is just take refuge in him and continue doing what you are doing as per your own nature.\n\nItite Gnanam Akhyatam Guhyat Guhyatram Maya Vimrushyat Ashe. We have discussed this thing in detail. From chapter two onward. We have analyzed every point. In the end I came down and told you that just follow your own Dharma, your own nature. You will not incur any sin.\n\nDo not worry about other people are doing, do not copy them. Your welfare is in following your own Dharma and give up your ego and attachment. And I will take care of everything else. I told you this very secret of knowledge. Secret means it was right now hidden from me. It was right there but hidden from me.\n\nBecause of my own likes and dislikes, my vasanas, my ignorance, I was not able to see this. I took that coverings away from you so that you can see the knowledge as is. I told you in its entirety. Vimrushya Etit Asena. Reflect on it in its totality. Don't take a verse here and there from Bhagavad Gita.",
      "reflection": "The Gita's final teaching is surrender. Not passive resignation, but active trust.

Depending on the quality of the equipment, outer behavior will be different from each other.\n\nJust as we have used these examples many many times. This room space is dependent on the conditioning. How far the walls are from each other and how far the ceiling is from the floor. But the space is the same space as it is outside. The space outside and space inside is no different same. All pervading space is in each room in this universe.\n\nWherever you find a space which is confined by limitations, the space is universal. The same way I said that. Isvara Sarva Bhutanam Rudeshe Tishtati the core of all being is the Ishvara Himself is residing because of his presence. Only things are functioning. But how they are functioning. Brahmayan Sarva Bhutani Yantra Rudhani Maya by his illusive power Maya everyone is functioning in this world.\n\nThey are functioning because of Iswara's presence and his power of Maya. The elusive power Brahmayan Sarvabhoot are Yantra Rudhani. It seems like they are just mounted on a machine, helpless to act in this world. We are driven by our own likes and dislikes and vasanas almost compulsively. Whether we like it or not. We see something which is of our liking, we will be attracted towards it.\n\nSomething which is of not conducive, we will be staying away from it. Bhagavan said everybody is propelled by this Maya as if they are helpless. But at the core of all being, Ishvara is the cause for all beings functioning in this world. Keep that unity in mind. So this is a profound revelation. We knew that everybody is different from each other.\n\nEveryone has their own qualities. Everyone has their liking and disliking. Everyone has their own talents. But see, what is common is the cause for all the talents and all the liking and all the disliking is that all pervading principle. The Ishvara, the Lord himself. So Brahman, the all pervading self, with his power of Maya becomes the almighty Creator Ishwara.\n\nWith this Maya, he creates this world of plurality. So I myself, with my power of dreaming, I create my own world of dream. While I'm dreaming, I'm by myself. Even the dream is me. The people in the dream is me. In the dreamer himself is also me.\n\nThere is no other entity. Only when I wake up, I realize that there are not too many people around. There were no different sceneries around. So this is like it is in Ishwara's mind, a great dream. So therefore he said Brahmayan Sarva Bhutani Yantra Rudhani Maya. By this elusive power of Ishvara, each individual in this world is functioning compulsively.\n\nDriven by their own temperaments and qualities. So therefore he says Tamevasharanam gacha. So now they advise you, understood that the people will be different. So you are different from everybody else. Do not try to compare yourself with others and don't try to copy them. You find your own bearings and what is good for you, what you like.\n\nContinue functioning. Except keep the Lord in mind that he is Almighty. He is making me do all these things and therefore I am offering everything I do to Him. Tamevasharanam gacha. Take refuge in that Ishvara, that Almighty, all pervading consciousness. Sarva bhavena Bharata in all your being, with all your thoughts, even thinking about your professional thoughts, your relationships, everything.\n\nWhile you are thinking, put him in the center of it all these things are only possible because of Him. Take refuge in him that you are the ones who is enabling me to function in this world as an individual. Tat Prasada paramsanthim Sthanam prapsi Saswatam. If you take refuge in him with all your being, with all your thoughts, no matter what that is, offer it to him that I can only think this way because of you. I can only act this way because of you. Once you start assigning all credits to him, then you are relieved.\n\nYou have no responsibilities. So in the end Bhagavan said this individualized ego which is identifying with this body, mind and intellect and taking credit for what I'm doing, thinking that I'm the doer. If you just keep that aside, do everything that you are doing right now exactly as you are doing. Because you are doing it as per your nature. You are propelled by your nature to do it. If you try to resist your nature, you are a distortion, a mental disease.\n\nSo keep doing what you are doing. Just keep in mind Tamevasharanam Gacha, Sarva Bhavya Bharata. Just take refuge in Him. Make your identification with him versus this limited body, mind and intellect. Tat prasadat paramshantin sthan praapasi Saswatam. The grace is when the identification is complete then I obviously become one with him, his qualities become my qualities.\n\nI start thinking I have now an access to his capacities. You joined a company a day before and from next day onwards you're part of the company. All the resources of the company. You take the brochure of the company and go to a new client and say I represent IBM. All the IBM's resources are your resources. Now before that, a day before, when you have not joined the company yet, you didn't have that brochure from IBM with you.\n\nYou are just an individual. You can say I can do this and that doesn't really mean much. Once you attached the resources of the Great, all his resources, your resources, all the qualifications of that company become your qualifications. Once you identify with him and take refuge in him Tat Prasad with his grace you will achieve that Santisthanam Propyasi Sastvatam. You will find that eternal peace and a firm abode. All you have to do is just take refuge in him and continue doing what you are doing as per your own nature.\n\nItite Gnanam Akhyatam Guhyat Guhyatram Maya Vimrushyat Ashe. We have discussed this thing in detail. From chapter two onward. We have analyzed every point. In the end I came down and told you that just follow your own Dharma, your own nature. You will not incur any sin.\n\nDo not worry about other people are doing, do not copy them. Your welfare is in following your own Dharma and give up your ego and attachment. And I will take care of everything else. I told you this very secret of knowledge. Secret means it was right now hidden from me. It was right there but hidden from me.\n\nBecause of my own likes and dislikes, my vasanas, my ignorance, I was not able to see this. I took that coverings away from you so that you can see the knowledge as is. I told you in its entirety. Vimrushya Etit Asena. Reflect on it in its totality. Don't take a verse here and there from Bhagavad Gita.",
      "reflection": "The Gita's final teaching is surrender. Not passive resignation, but active trust. Having done what you can, release the outcome.\n\nToday, identify one situation where you're holding on too tightly. Practice opening your hands. Let it be what it will be.\n\nArjuna's journey from paralysis to clarity, from confusion to conviction, is available to each of us. The teaching has been given. What remains is to live it."

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 18, Moksha Sannyasa Yoga, Yoga of Liberation through Renunciation. This is the last chapter in Bhagavad Gita, and Bhagavan has given his final advice to us. It boils down to Sreyan Swadharma Vigunaha Paradharma Swanashti da. Your own Dharma is better for you than other dharma. And therefore he says, Sahajam Karma Kamateja Sadosham Abhiyana Tej. These are the two basic facts.\n\nHe pointed out to us that your welfare is staying within your Dharma, whatever Dharma that you have acquired through your own choice. So my dharma as an architect, I have chosen myself. I decided to go to architecture school and therefore I became an architect. Now Bhagavad said, your welfare is in your Dharma. Don't try to practice something other than what you're good at. There was Sahajam Karma Gandhiya.\n\nDo what comes naturally to you. Because of all your experiences and vasanas and tendencies and your training, there are few things in life which comes easier for you. And others don't stay with what comes naturally to you, even though other things look more glamorous, more glorious. But you say, even if your Dharma, you found it Sadosha Mapi, even there are some defects in it or not very perfect. Do actions in your own field which come naturally to you. There are the only two things he said, doing so you will overcome all your obstacles and you will never incur sin.\n\nWorking in the field which come naturally to you, keeping your own goal in mind that I'm doing it to get my ultimate happiness. But once you will never incur sin. Sin, as we have discussed, is negative impression on my mind, which creates agitations. All we are looking for in life is peace. Give me peace of mind. Peace of mind only come when mind is tranquil.\n\nBecause the mind will only be tranquil if you're working according to your own Dharma. And then he said the final advice after completing his entire discourse. And he said, now you do whatever you think is right for you. He gave you the complete choice one more time and said, let me summarize what I told you. Manmana Bhava mad Bhaktaha Madhya ji Mam namaskuruhu. In other words, Krishna said, if you want to summarize the entire teachings of Bhagavad Gita in half a verse, this is what I had been telling you.\n\nTo get the happiness which you are looking for, fix your mind onto me. Me the all pervading almighty self which is also your self. Focus your mind on that mad Bhaktah worship that identify with that Madhya Ji. Offer all your actions to me. Offer all your actions to the highest goal which you have when you go to the first grade. I'm learning this and that.\n\nBecause eventually I want to become a doctor. My granddaughter was telling me yesterday, I have two inventions I want to release before I became a doctor. So there is an ultimate goal in mind. That ultimate goal is to find perfect happiness. Perfect happiness is only there if my mind is tranquil. Bhagawan said, Madhya Ji, offer everything to me Maam namaskurohu and take refuge in me.\n\nThen he clarified say Sarva Dharma and parity. Aham TVA Sarva Papebiha Moksa Kshya minasucha. Right now you think that you are incomplete. You have lots of baggage of all your incompleteness and sins. As you said, the things which you have not done right. I have not done this thing right in my life.\n\nBhagawan said, no, you can't. You cannot correct yourself. But if you take refuge in me, I can correct that. Sarva Dharma and Parityajya. And we have discussed this Sarva Dharman. Every role that I take, it comes with its own Dharma.\n\nEvery role a drama actor plays, it comes with its own requirement. Now if I start identifying with each role, then I'll get confused. I will have a nervous breakdown. I will have a personality disorder. I don't know who I am. Am I a king or a pauper?\n\nBecause I play so many different roles. The Bhagawan thing in your life, you take too many of these roles. All those roles come with their own Dharma. My Dharma is a father. My Dharma is an architect. My Dharma is a husband.\n\nMy Dharma is a citizen of this country. My Dharma is an employer. All those Dharmas, if I get bogged down into them and think that they will give me my Happiness. Then I'll be completely shattered. I do not really know which role is more important than others. Keep working in that dharma when you are there.\n\nWhen you are an architect, act as an architect. When you are father, act as a father. But at the end of the day, you realize that you are something other than all the roles which you play. An actor in Beverly Hills knows that he is something other than the roles he plays. So Bhagawanja Sarva Dharma and Paritya Jya. At the end of the day, give up.\n\nAll those dharmas are not yours. But they belong to the roles which you play. While you're playing that role, you can't give up those dharmas. But once you're out of that role, leave those dharmas with that role and focus on who you are. Who is there One constant in all these roles which has its own dharma. So Bhagawan says, ma makeam sharam Braja.\n\nIdentify with that one single entity which is pervading through all the roles which you play. Ahamtva Sarva Pape bihamoksik Shami Mashu chah. Once you identify with that, all the limitations you have in each one of those roles are of no consequence because it only belongs to the role. You may not have played the role correctly. Fine, let's move on to the next one. One movie gets flopped, the actor doesn't get shattered.\n\nHe moves on to another one, waiting for the next hit. Don't get caught up in any of those roles as that's the only thing which is mine. And if I fail there, I have failed in it. Bhagavan said, you don't worry. Once you take refuge in your own self, everything will be alright. Now that you have learnt this knowledge, don't just sit back and relax.\n\nThat's not where your duty ends. You have to do your part. Now that you were privileged enough to know what is right, you also have an obligation to teach others what is right. And I, the parent, was a son at one point of time. And I got the advice from my parents and they told me what is right and wrong. I made my life right or wrong according to that.\n\nAnd now I learned after my experience what is right and wrong. I have an obligation to pass on that knowledge to my children. Ya Imam paramam guhiyam mad bhakteshu abhi dashyathi bhakti mai param kutva Mama eva isyati asansaya. He said, there is one who declares this, teaches this knowledge of mine to my devotees, not to the people who are not interested in it, but those who are inspired themselves to make their life better, make their life appropriate, remove all the negatives from their life, but they still do not know how to do it. When you find those enthusiastic students, that's what you want to teach them. Therefore I said, the one who teaches this sacred knowledge of mind to my Bhakta, those who are devoted to this knowledge, Bhakti mai param kutva maam eva Eshyati asansayaha.\n\nI consider that he is worshipping me. Bhagavan said, you don't have to come to my temple every day and put $1 in the Aarti or to do anything special. The greatest devotion we can offer to our teacher is to carry the torch of his knowledge. That's why we do Pada Puja. Because the platform on which my Guru is standing that the platform which I worship, that knowledge is important. Bhagawan said, one who spread this knowledge of mine which I gave it to you, to others, I consider him to be my devotee and therefore he will come to me without any doubt.\n\nHe will become one with me or Sansayah. No other thing needed. Bhagavan said, you just continue. You learn this knowledge, practice it, and then pass it on to the others. That Bhagavan said, I consider to my greatest devotion. So basically it encourages all of us, whatever little we have learned from Bhagavad Gita.\n\nThere is an obligation to impart the knowledge to someone else who is curious to know. He may not have the right frame of understanding, but he wants to know. You have an obligation to give him that knowledge. Bhagawan says, Nachatasmat manushesu kaschinmi priyakrutamaha. None other than that person who carries this torch of knowledge is dearer to me than him. But once I He is the closest to me because he's carrying forward the mission that I have that I want to correct the misunderstanding in people.\n\nYou were confused, Arjuna. I gave you this discourse so that you can now act in your life correctly. Now you have an obligation to do that to someone else who you will find it in the same situation. And I consider that as my worship that you have appreciated what I have given you. And such a person is dearer to me. Some other people may come and other things for me, but they are of lesser value than you carrying forward my mission.\n\nBhavita Nachame tasmat anyaha Priyatara Bhuvi, not only now, but even in future, there won't be anyone who is dearer to me than the one who is spreading this knowledge to make this world better and spreading the right knowledge. So Swamiji points out here that we have this misconception in our Hinduism that we obviously don't convert people. We don't encourage people to come to our fore. In fact, we discourage people if someone has to be Hindu. You can't become a Hindu unless you're born Hindu. Swamiji Sri Bhagawan clearly points out that that's not part of our culture.\n\nWe do not want forced conversion. We don't want to tell people who have not yet understood to believe in this knowledge. Give him his own time. Because forced conversion, forced imposition, never works in reality anywhere. Therefore you say, find people who are willing to understand this and give this knowledge. That's your obligation.\n\nSo that's a missionary work. They never said that this knowledge never be given out to anybody, should not be given to people who are not from this class or other. Simply said, find the right person, right group of people who are anxious to make their lives better. Give this knowledge to them. I'll consider that to the greatest devotion to me. And he said, therefore such a person deals with not only now, but even if this open your mind will never change.\n\nYou know it's not right now I'm telling you that, but in future it may be something different. It will hold true all throughout the history that whoever spreads his teacher's knowledge, that the greatest devotee that the greatest Guru Dakshina one can give it to his teacher. If, let's say you consider that you are not capable of spreading this knowledge, well, you don't have resources, you don't have temperament. You don't consider yourself worthy of doing so. But if you just listen to this Adhesya de cha Imam Dharma Samvadam Avayoho. This dialogue of ours, this sacred dialogue of ours which deals with who you are in reality and who you are not, how to act in this world so that you can achieve your ultimate goal.\n\nThis dialogue which we had, which is sacred, even if you just study that listening is slightly different than studying one who studies this.",

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 18, Moksa Sannyasa Yoga. Yoga of Liberation through renunciation. Liberating yourself from all that is binding you. What is binding me is my limitations. I'm limiting myself by associating with my body, mind and intellectual. So in the end, Bhagavan Samara says, sarva Dharma Parityajya Maam Ekam Sharanam Praja.\n\nGive up your dependence on your body, mind and intellect as the source of your happiness. That eternal happiness which you are seeking, you are right now dependent on your body, mind and intellect. I'll gain through my power, I'll gain through my intellect. I'll gain through my manipulating the others. Bhagavan said, give up all those and just take refuge in me, the source, the self, the consciousness. And I will take care of all your sins.\n\nAll the things which you have as negative impressions, I will take care of. I will wipe them out and make you clean so that you can experience the joy which is your nature. This is praptasya pravtvi. This is something which we already have. All we have to do is clear that which is veiling that happiness. So we concluded the discourse on Bhagavad Gita.\n\nBhagavad Bhagavan also said, who you should not be teaching this knowledge. One who does not have any discipline. One who does not have any devotion towards this knowledge. One who, who has no sense of service to others. One is in other words, so self centered. Such a person will not be able to learn anything from you because he's so self centered about himself.\n\nThen lastly he said, the one who cavils at this knowledge or me, if I do not have any faith in any idea, I will never be able to learn. See, in Gujaratri a child is crying for a long time. Asu ragda tyanay Ragada means raga tana pulling. Why are you pulling all these ragas? You know why they did? There was kind of contempt against the people who perform classical music and they will continue.\n\nSo when somebody now you have no appreciation for it. And therefore now you're associating with their babies, crying and saying why are you ragadatthan? Now that's a cavilling towards that art. I have no respect for that art. I have sometimes, you know, people go for the dance program and say so how was was the same though South Indian dancing all the time. Because they were looking for a Bollywood dancing that turned out to be Kathak classical dancing concert.\n\nBecause they have no appreciation for their art. I have seen the Ghatapata, the discourse about Vedanta where they are using this analogy. Ghata Patta, Ghatapada, Garbhad Karta in Bombay, right? Gatapata became Gadbar. No appreciation for that discussion or discourse. Now such a person, if you try to teach the same thing, one who says Garbhad Iska you try to teach him Vedanta will not work.\n\nOne who says Vairu Ragda, he will not learn music. He has no appreciation for it. So Bhagavan says such a person, you should not be teaching this Bhagavad Gita. He has to come to a level where he has disciplined himself. He has devotion for this knowledge and he has a sense of service. In essence he does not think about his own good but see oneness with others.\n\nThat's how we do service. We can only serve somebody whom we revere, appreciate or love for one who has none of this. For this knowledge, you should not be teaching that. On the other hand, Bhagavan said, if you learned this knowledge by God's grace, you got this chance to learn this precious knowledge from your teacher. You should share this with others. Do not be self centered.\n\nIf you're a Christian, come and ask me. You don't become just a scholar but share this with others. This is the concept of franchising, right? You have a concept and give it to others. That's how it grows into a huge multinational. Otherwise selling burger, how can that be a big business?\n\nIt is the simplest thing in the world. Take a bun and put a patty in between. Put little lettuce, tomato and ketchup, you're done. But it's a multinational entity. Because the concept of franchising. Somebody asked Einstein, is there anything baffles you in this world?\n\nHe said the concept of compound interest. And somebody has demonstrated to me, said, if you get one penny first day, then it doubles next Day you keep doubling pennies versus I give you million dollar first hand. Which one in 20 years will be greater and he demonstrates the other one will be like in millions of dollars. The compound interest. So compounding this knowledge for the greater good of the society. It is every student's duty to share this with others.\n\nThose who are interested and are worthy. So therefore Bhagavan said, such a person will certainly will come to me now. Teaching this subject which you have learnt, you become master at it. After a while you become one with that subject. If you learn music, then continue teaching music. You will become a master of it.\n\nBecause you are practicing more and more and more by every time you teach to somebody else. So Bhagavan says, such a person will certainly come to me. He will become me in a sense he will attain that oneness he is seeking with his own supreme self. So Bhagavan is actively asking you to go out and teach others. How did Swami Chinmayanda became a Jagat Guru? By introducing the idea of study group.\n\nIf he had just said come to my lecture, we would have gone to his lectures and left. I did that for a long time. I obviously met Swamiji when I was 17 years old. First I just went to his lectures because in India I did not know. When I came to USA, first series I attended in 1983, I had no idea about study group. But Swamiji said at the end of the Gita Yajna that those of you are interested now must attend study group and say, what is the study group?\n\nSo Gaurang Nanavati from Houston called me up because I filled out that form. And I had no interest really in joining study group. Because I was thinking, who else other than Swami Chinnamanda who can teach me this? But because Swamiji said that head little Shraddha, I must go. And that's how I went to study Guru. This is where I started learning Bhagavad Gita, not from Swamiji's lectures.\n\nSo the idea of these study groups has made this Chinmaya mission a great organization. In sharing this knowledge. Idea came from Bhagavan Sri Krishna, share your knowledge. So Bhagavan said, such a person will certainly will achieve the goal he's seeking. Then the next he said, there is no one in this world who is closer to me than the one who is teaching this Bhagavad Gita. With Shraddha, with having the supreme faith in me, in this knowledge.\n\nYou cannot teach something if you are not convinced about it. You can only convince others. If you are convinced about it with conviction. One who teaches this Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavan says, I don't think there's anyone who is dearer to me, anyone who is nearer to me than that person. Because he came closest to the goal of becoming one with that universal self. So Bhagavan has glorified the teachers and the teachings.\n\nAnd then he said, adhesyatecha Imam Dharmayam samvaoho Gnan yagneham istahaam ithi me matehi. Now the student, is there anything beneficial in just learning? One who studies this dialogue of ours about Dharma. This dialogue, Bhagavad Gita, all 18 chapters of Tira. This is dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna. So Krishna is telling Arjuna this, our dialogue about Dharma.\n\nWhat is right, what is wrong, what is real, what is unreal. Who studies such a person? I consider that such a person is worshipping me through Gnani Yajna. He may not be a Krishna Bhakta. He may not be doing Sri Krishna, Shranham, Sri Krishna, Shrana, Sri Krishna. He may not be going to the temple at all.\n\nHe may not bow down at Krishna statue in the temple. But Bhagavan said, I will consider that or not consider. He said, it is my conviction that such a person is worshipping me through Gnana Yoga. So the student who is studying Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavan said he is directly worshipping me. And we have learnt in Bhagavad Gita previously. How do you serve your teacher?\n\nBy living the ideal the teacher teaches is the best service to your teacher. Your teacher teaches you music and you don't do anything about it. But just keep giving him fees and never learned music. Is that a service to him? It may make his living. But he is not very proud of you.\n\nBut my teacher teaches me something and I excel in it. And then propagate that knowledge even further. He will be very proud when he hears about you. Even today you go and tell Gaurangban we went to Neelkhan's class. You know why he is my teacher? When he hears that he knows after all these years, Nilkant is still into Bhagavad Gita has not given up.\n\nThat's a service to your teacher. So Bhagavan said, such a person, I'll consider that he's serving me directly. He's worshipping me directly through Gnana Yoga word Yajna Signifies sacrificial fire is invoked and devotees are offering oblations in it. You see here, the fire of knowledge is kindled by your studies and you are offering your ignorance into it. Up till now what I considered me and now no, it is not me. So my ignorance about myself, which in common language we call ego is what we are offering into this Gnar Yajna.\n\nTherefore, Bhagavan said, I am convinced, I'm convicted that such a person is worshipping me through Gnan Yajna. So when student is glorified here, then the next one says okay. But somebody is not even studying. We have heard this before. There is a difference between reading and studying. Swamiji explained, you read newspaper.\n\nYou really have no other interest but to get some information what's going on? So you are reading newspaper, but you study your subject. I have to study because I want to know the knowledge. So not just reading Bhagavad Gita. So just chanting Bhagavad Gita may or may not do much good to you. But studying Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavan said, I'm convinced that you are worshipping me through Gnani Yajna.\n\nBut now I'm not studying. Sraddha vana anasuyashcha Srunayat Apiyo naraha. A person who is listening to this knowledge, he may not be studying intently. He may not be reading Bhagavad Gita. But he's listening to the discourse about Bhagavad Gita. About the knowledge about Bhagavad Gita Sadhguru.\n\nBut you have to have faith in it. You're not just listening just to find out what it is all about. With Shraddha, we when we listen to somebody like Dalai Lama or Sri Sri Ravi Shankar or somebody whom we have Shraddha and listen to him, we are intently listening what he's saying. So we're trying to understand what is the message behind this. That's the Sarda Saddhavan Anasuya. He's not listening to find out what is wrong in that.\n\nAs we had heard before that Max Muller and those scholars were given grant by European powers to go and study Sanskrit. So find out what is all this garbage they are teaching their people. And then tell them that this all wrong. That Anasuya that's cavilling at that knowledge. If you are not doing it because of that and it turns out that Max Muller became probably the greatest scholar because he probably had the real intention, even though his sponsors may not have, that such a person who is just listening to this discourse about Bhagavad Gita, the knowledge of Bhagavad Gita sovapi muktaha, he also will get liberated.",

Having done what you can, release the outcome.\n\nToday, identify one situation where you're holding on too tightly. Practice opening your hands.

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 18, Moksa Sannyas Yoga. We have come to the final concluding portion where Bhagavan has concluded his portion. Arjuna has confirmed that he is now completely in control of himself. His delusion is gone. He regained his memory. In other words, what is right and what is wrong, what needs to be done and what's to be avoided and what his real self is.\n\nI'm now ready to do whatever you have asked me to do. In other words, I'm now ready to follow your instruction in Bhagavad Gita, which I have learnt so far from you. So I will now fight this war. Basically, when we are deluded and somebody gives advice and we are now ready to face the challenges of life, then we say, don't worry, I'm now ready. I will fight this battle. That's where Arjuna is now.\n\nAnd the only other two people who are participating in this was Sanjaya, sitting in Dhritarashtra's palace. Dhritarashtra, the blind king, who is somewhat a cause for this conflict. Had he done what needed to be done for him as a king, we wouldn't have the situation of these two armies facing each other. Because of his blindness, his ignorance about what is right and wrong, the situation led to this battle of the war. So he's sitting in his palace. Sanjay, his charioteer or the personal assistant, had narrated what was going on between the Krishna and Arjuna.\n\nAnd as we had discussed before, this was only possible because Bhagavan Vyad Vyas, in his last ditch efforts to stop this war, goes to Dhritarashtra and says, you need to stop this and for you to see. I can give you a divine vision, see what's happening and this will lead to a disaster for Kauravaz. But he was not comfortable, so he said, I do not want this vision. Give it to my secretary, then he can narrate it to me. And that's how Sanjaya got the divine vision. So he can see sitting in this palace.\n\nAnd as Sid would have argued, it may be a different arrangement but for all practical purpose Sanjaya became the first telecaster who narrated what's happening in a distant place. He was given this reason so that he can not only see what's happening there, he can also hear what Krishna and Arjuna is talking about and he can also see in their minds what they are saying. So now since Arjuna has concluded Sanjaya gives the final comments. The last five verses are what? Sanjaya is the third party. Arjuna is involved in it completely.\n\nHe, he was the recipient of this knowledge. Knowledge was directly given to him. Krishna was the giver of the knowledge and he obviously had not only Arjuna but everyone's betterment in mind. Sanjaya is the third party, looking at the situation now gives his version of what he has seen. So the next five verses which will conclude Bhagavad Gita it says Sanjay Sanjay said ITHI aham Vasudevashya Parthasyacha Mahat Manah Samadam Imam Ashrausham Adbutam Romaharshanam he said ITHI aham Vasudeva this is me witnessing the dialogue between Vasudeva, Krishna the Lord the God Because Vasudeva is Krishna name because he's the son of Vasudeva Vasudevasudam Devam Devaki so he's also called, he's called Vasudeva because he is Vasudev's son. He's also called Vasudeva because he is the Deva of Vasava.\n\nVasava we have Learned in chapter 10 are the deities of seasons. There are eight seasons and each season has its own presiding deity. As we have said in our culture everything is personified and nothing can really work in chaotic situation. Everything has its own order. If there is an order we absolutely know there is a controller without any laws or any enforcing agency there cannot be any order since in nature there is a perfect order. They got to be law maker and law enforcer and the enforcing deities for these seasons are Vasava Vasus.\n\nThese eight Vasus are controlling these eight seasons. And as we may have discussed before the six seasons as we know which is the normal three, you know summer, winter, what is the monsoon here? But then there are three subset like spring and fall. So there are six seasons. Then where are the other two? The other two are in our mind happiness on happiness.\n\nSo there are two micro seasons and macro seasons make eight verses, presiding deeds. All Vasus are Vasava and the Deva of Vasu is Vasudeva. So he is the Deva of all the seasons. In other words, he is Deva of awe all the seasons in our life. He is the presiding deity, Vasudeva, the consciousness. All these eight seasons are perceived by me because consciousness is functioning through me.\n\nSo this is the dialogue between Vasudeva and Mahatmana Partha High Souled Arjuna Arjuna is called High Souled here because not because he was Krishna cousin or Pandu son, but because he is a normal man who has faced the challenges of life and broke down. But he had the courage to listen to the right advice and rise to this situation. Therefore his high soul, not because he was perfect, not because he had no fault, but he has normal faults of a normal person. But he had courage to overcome them. So he said the dialogue between the supreme self, the sacred and the normal man Partha. Listening to this, I am so thrilled that I am having the goosebumps.\n\nI am having goosebumps. What have I experienced so wonderful? So he said this was an incredible dialogue which I never thought I'll be able to witness in my life. And then he continues and says, Vyasa Prasadat Srutvan Etat Guham Idham Param Yogam Yogeshwarat Krishna Saksat Kathaya Tahaswayam I had good fortune of listening to this dialogue because of Vyasa Prasadat I was not capable of listening to it. I would have never been able to see what Krishna and Arjuna are talking about. It was possible for me to hear because the grace of Vyasa and we have seen why Vyasa gave the divine vision and therefore I can listen to it.\n\nAny experience which I feel is incredible in my life, I always think it came through me by somebody's grace, in this case sanjayasavyasa's grace. He said that Yogam Yogeshwara Krishna Sakshat Kathayatah this dialogue which describes the yoga I heard directly from the mouth of Yogeshwara Krishna we have learned before Krishna Yogeshwara he is the Lord of Yoga. He is the perfect Avatara. Because there was never a time he was not connected with his supreme self. He was always a man walking on this earth was always connected with his supreme self. One who is connected with his supreme self is a Yogi.\n\nKrishna is Yogeshwara. He is the Lord of all yogis. Because there was never a time in his life from the time he was born till he died. The Yogeshwara Krishna Saksatka I've heard from a person who is Yogeshwara from his mouth. In other words, it's not that. This was something completely new to me.\n\nGrowing up in Vedic culture as a minister or the private secretary of the Great King. I heard this before I knew all these things, but I now heard from directly from the Lord himself, the one who is one with the supreme self. So this now completely clarifies any doubt I ever had in my mind. This is now my direct knowledge. I experience directly what the Lord has said. The next one says Rajan Samsung Samvadam Imam Adhvatam Kesava Arjuna Punyam Hrishyamicha Murumoho.\n\nI keep remembering what I have just experienced over and over again and more. I think about it again and again. It gives me great joy to know that the self is immutable, imperishable. More and more I remember that it gives me great strength and great joy that what reality is, I have heard from the great soul. So he's trying to impress upon Dhritarashtra that you are not facing somebody, or your sons are not facing somebody who is mortal, facing someone who is the Lord himself, who has direct knowledge. And he will be on Arjuna's side.\n\nTatya Samsung Rupam Adbutam Harehe Vismayomahan Rajan Hrishyami Chapunaha. Not only that I heard the dialogue between the two, but I also saw his Viratarop, his cosmic form. I've seen your sons going into his mouth and getting crushed. I have seen these Mahatmas praising him, some in fear and some are in awe. That Adhut vision Tat Samsung Harees, that wonderful, magnificent Rupa form I keep remembering over and over again. And I'm wonderstruck.\n\nI am completely wonderstruck about that vision. Orajan Rushyamecha Puna Punaha. I rejoice again and again just seeing the Lord's complete form. And I know that the victory will be on the side of the truth. Obviously all the good people who knew what is right, including Drona, Bheeshma, Sanjaya, Vidur. But they could not be on the Pandava side because of the Niti Shastra at that time, if you have eaten somebody's salt, in other words, if you're obliged by somebody, you have to be on their side, no matter how wrong he is.\n\nTherefore they cannot be on Pandava's side but. But they are making every effort to see whether Dhritarashtra changes his mind. He is one person who has a complete control to stop this war right then and there. But as we have said, he has already confessed he is very comfortable in his blindness, in his ignorance. He does not want to come out of his comfort zone of what he knows. This is basically we are at some level something which is not very familiar to us.\n\nWe are afraid of the change. That's why the one generation or another we always the generation gap. Because I in my old age are so comfortable in what I do. I get completely baffled by all this technology and the social media. And so we need support from somebody like Sonali say what do we do with this? Well, we can do this.\n\nThat's a Vishmaya for me. The last verse is complete conclusion of what Sanjaya has learned. But not only this is only the Sanjay's opinion, this is not merely Sanjaya opinion that this is what I have. It basically is a direct advice to us how to live life. So it says Yatra Yogeshwara Krishna Yatra Partha, Dhanurdharaha Tatra Shri Vijaya Bhutihi Dhruvah Niti matir Mama. Where there is Yogeshwarakrishna, he didn't simply say just Krishna.\n\nWhere there is Krishna, where there is Arjuna, Yatra Yogeshwarakrishna, where there is the Lord of Yoga, the Lord Krishna. And we say what that is. That person is the one who is always one with his supreme self. That Yogeshwarakrishna is present in other our consciousness. When we involve our consciousness, our divine vision which is the sacred in us, the divine in us with Yatra Partha, Dhanurdharaha and where there is an Arjuna with his bow and arrow ready to fight not on the ground which was the case in the first chapter. If we face challenges in this life, we have the tools to fight this battle.\n\nBut we get dejected and put our tools down and say I'm not ready. So we cannot win that battle and therefore there cannot be any success. World will be what it is. You will be facing this battle of life no matter how sacred and pious you are. Because that's the nature of the world. What you have to be is Dhanur Dhara Partha, not just a Partha, Dhanurdhara Partha Partha is a common man like you and I.\n\nOnly difference is he's ready to fight. So when you are ready to fight the Challenges of life. But not just with your ego and say, I can take care of myself.",
