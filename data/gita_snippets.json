        "Dhritarashtra said: \"O Sanjaya, assembled on the holy field of Kurukshetra, eager to fight—what did my sons and the sons of Pandu do?\"",
        "Sanjaya replied: \"Having seen the Pandava army arranged in battle formation, King Duryodhana approached his teacher Drona and spoke.\"",
        "\"O Teacher, look at this great army of Pandu's sons, arranged by the son of Drupada—your wise disciple.\""
      ],
      "commentary": "Think about this for a moment: the Bhagavad Gita doesn't begin with Krishna. It doesn't begin with Arjuna. It begins with a blind man asking a question from his palace, miles away from the battlefield.\n\nDhritarashtra couldn't see. But his blindness wasn't just physical—and that's precisely the point.\n\nThe day before this war, the sage Vyasa came to Dhritarashtra and offered him something extraordinary. \"I can give you divine sight,\" Vyasa said. \"You can witness everything that happens on this battlefield.\"\n\nDhritarashtra's response? \"No, thank you. I'm comfortable as I am. But if you're offering, give it to Sanjaya instead.\"\n\n*I'm comfortable in my blindness.*\n\nHow many times have we said the same thing, in different words? We don't want to see what's really happening in our marriage. We don't want to acknowledge what that habit is doing to us. We'd rather not look too closely at how we're living our lives. Chosen blindness feels easier than facing difficult truths.\n\nThe Gita begins here because this is where most of us begin—not wanting to see.\n\nNow look at the first words Dhritarashtra speaks: *\"Dharmakshetre Kurukshetre\"*—at the field of Dharma, at Kurukshetra.\n\nHe calls it Dharmakshetra. The field of righteousness. He knows. Somewhere deep down, Dhritarashtra knows exactly which side represents Dharma in this war. He's not confused about right and wrong. He simply can't bring himself to act on what he knows.\n\nThis is one of the Gita's earliest teachings, tucked into its very first line: knowing what's right is not the same as doing what's right. Dhritarashtra knew. He just couldn't act.\n\nThere's something else hidden in this verse—a single word that reveals everything about why this war is happening. The word is *\"Māmakāḥ\"*—mine.\n\n\"What did *my* sons and *Pandu's* sons do?\"\n\nBut wait. Weren't they all grandsons of the same man? Weren't the Pandavas also descendants of Kuru? Why aren't they all simply \"Kauravas\"?\n\nBecause Dhritarashtra couldn't see them that way. *My* children versus *their* children. *My* family versus *those people*. This is how he saw the world. This is how the world always divides itself before it goes to war.\n\nWe do this too, don't we? My team versus their team. My community versus outsiders. We draw these lines constantly, and then we wonder why there's so much conflict. The Gita is pointing at something fundamental here: this *mine versus yours* thinking is the seed from which all conflict grows.\n\nIn verse 2, the scene shifts to the battlefield. Sanjaya begins his narration, and immediately we see something curious: Duryodhana, the mighty king with the larger army, is nervous.\n\nHe had eleven akshauhinis—massive military divisions. The Pandavas had only seven. By any calculation, he should win. Yet look at what he does: he rushes to his teacher Drona, not to the commander Bhishma, and starts anxiously pointing out the enemy's strengths.\n\nWhy would someone with such an advantage feel so unsettled?\n\nBecause numbers aren't everything. Duryodhana knew, in some part of himself, that he was on the wrong side of this fight. He had stolen a kingdom. He had tried to kill his cousins. He had humiliated Draupadi in open court. All the military might in the world couldn't quiet that knowledge.\n\nThis is something worth sitting with: when you're doing the right thing, you can face challenges with a certain peace. When you're not, no amount of external advantage makes you feel secure. Duryodhana had everything going for him—except the one thing that would have given him real confidence.\n\nAnd then comes verse 3, where Duryodhana speaks to Drona. On the surface, he's just pointing out the Pandava formation. But listen to his words more carefully: \"Look at this army, arranged by the son of Drupada—*your wise disciple*.\"\n\nThere's an accusation buried in that phrase. *Your* disciple. The one *you* taught. Duryodhana is essentially saying: \"This is your fault, teacher. You trained them. You gave them the skills they're now using against us.\"\n\nThis is how it works when we're not willing to own our choices. We blame the teacher, the parents, the circumstances, the system—anyone but ourselves. Duryodhana never once stopped to ask: \"How did my own actions lead us here?\" Instead, he looked for someone else to hold responsible.\n\nThere's a deeper teaching embedded in the structure of these opening verses that often gets overlooked. Notice how Vyasa, the author, chose to begin the text. He could have started with Krishna's teaching. He could have opened with some grand philosophical statement about the nature of reality. Instead, he begins with a question born from anxiety.\n\nDhritarashtra asks: *\"Kim akurvata\"*—what did they do? He's desperate to know. He can't bear the uncertainty. And this desperation reveals something crucial about the nature of attachment.\n\nWhen we are deeply attached to an outcome, uncertainty becomes unbearable. We need to know. We check our phones constantly. We ask the same questions over and over. We cannot rest until we have information that confirms or denies our hopes and fears.\n\nDhritarashtra is not simply curious about the battle. He is terrified. His whole sense of security—the kingdom he helped his son steal, the dynasty he hoped to establish—depends on the outcome of this war. No wonder he's asking questions before a single arrow has been fired.\n\nThe Gita begins this way to show us something about ourselves. How much of our mental activity is driven by this same anxious need to know? How much of our day is spent checking, confirming, seeking reassurance?\n\nSwami Chinmayananda used to point out that Kurukshetra was not just any battlefield—it was considered sacred ground. The name literally means \"field of the Kurus,\" the ancestral dynasty. But it was also called Dharmakshetra because it was a place where great sages had performed austerities and spiritual practices for generations.\n\nThere's a profound symbolism here. The battle for dharma—for right living—doesn't happen in some pristine spiritual environment away from the mess of life. It happens right here, on the same ground where our ancestors walked, where our family dramas play out, where the stakes are highest and the relationships most complicated.\n\nYou don't get to choose a convenient time and place for your spiritual growth. The battlefield finds you. It might be your workplace, your marriage, your relationship with your aging parents, your own health crisis. The question is never \"how do I avoid the battle?\" The question is \"how do I face it with clarity?\"\n\nConsider also the role of Sanjaya in these verses. He's the narrator, the one with divine sight, granted by Vyasa. Throughout the Gita, Sanjaya reports what's happening on the battlefield to the blind king.\n\nSanjaya represents something important: the possibility of true seeing. Unlike Dhritarashtra, who chose blindness, Sanjaya accepted the gift of vision. He can see the truth, and he reports it faithfully, even when that truth is painful to hear.\n\nEvery one of us has access to our own inner Sanjaya—that part of us that knows the truth, that sees clearly, that isn't fooled by our rationalizations. The question is: do we listen to it? Or do we, like Dhritarashtra, prefer to remain comfortable in our blindness?\n\nThe Gita is, in one sense, an invitation to become our own Sanjaya—to develop the capacity to see our lives clearly, to witness our own dramas with some degree of objectivity, to tell ourselves the truth even when it's inconvenient.\n\nOne more thing worth noting about these opening verses: the emotional tone. There's urgency here. There's anxiety. There's blame. There's defensiveness. The battlefield hasn't even begun, and already we see the full range of human reactivity on display.\n\nThis is intentional. The Gita doesn't pretend that we come to spiritual teaching from a place of calm readiness. We come to it desperate, confused, looking for someone to blame, terrified of what might happen. We come to it exactly as Arjuna will come to it in the verses ahead—overwhelmed and unable to function.\n\nAnd that's okay. That's the starting point. The Gita meets us where we are.\n\nFinally, let's consider the setting of these opening verses from a practical perspective. Here is Duryodhana, about to fight the most important battle of his life, and instead of focusing on strategy or inspiring his troops, he's complaining to his teacher about the enemy's strengths.\n\nThis is what anxiety does to us. It makes us focus on threats rather than possibilities. It makes us rehearse worst-case scenarios. It makes us seek validation for our fears rather than courage for our actions.\n\nDuryodhana had assembled the greatest army the world had ever seen. He had legendary warriors on his side—Bhishma, Drona, Karna, Ashwatthama. He had every material advantage. And yet here he is, fixated on what the other side has, unable to appreciate his own resources.\n\nWe do this constantly. We have health, relationships, skills, opportunities—and we obsess over what we lack. We have support systems and capabilities—and we fixate on the obstacles. This is the Duryodhana mind at work, and it never leads anywhere good.\n\nThe antidote isn't positive thinking or denial of real challenges. The antidote is clarity—seeing what we actually have, what the situation actually requires, and acting from that clear seeing rather than from anxiety and complaint.\n\nThat's the journey the Gita will take us on. But it starts here, with recognizing where we are: blind like Dhritarashtra, anxious like Duryodhana, looking for someone to blame. Only when we see this clearly can we begin to move beyond it.",
      "reflection": "These opening verses invite us to examine the Dhritarashtra within ourselves. Notice how he uses the word \"Mamakah\"—mine—creating an immediate division between \"my sons\" and \"Pandu's sons,\" even though both groups are equally his nephews and part of the same Kuru dynasty. This week, observe where you draw similar lines in your own life. Where do you say \"my team\" versus \"their team,\" \"my community\" versus \"outsiders\"? The Gita suggests that this \"mine versus theirs\" thinking is the very seed from which all conflict grows.\n\nConsider also the profound symbolism of Dhritarashtra's chosen blindness. When Vyasa offered him divine sight to witness the battle, he refused, preferring the comfort of not seeing. Ask yourself: What truths am I choosing not to see in my own life? Is there a difficult conversation I'm avoiding? A habit whose consequences I refuse to acknowledge? A relationship truth I'd rather not face? Like Dhritarashtra, we often find comfort in blindness—but the Gita reminds us that this comfort comes at a terrible cost.\n\nFinally, notice how Duryodhana, despite having the larger army (eleven akshauhinis versus seven), rushes nervously to his teacher Drona to point out the enemy's strengths. This reveals a profound truth: when we know deep down that our cause is not righteous, no amount of external advantage brings real security. Reflect on areas of your life where you feel anxious despite having \"everything going for you.\" Could this anxiety be pointing to a misalignment between your actions and your deeper sense of what is right?"

      "commentary": "We'll be discussing Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 1, Arjuna Vishada Yoga—the Yoga of Arjuna's Grief. In our scriptural system, there are two types of scripture, divided into two major categories. One is called Shruti. The other is called Smriti.\n\nShruti means \"heard\" and Smriti means \"remembered.\" The scriptures considered \"heard\" by the great sages in their contemplation, in their inspired moments, and then given out to the world, are considered Shrutis. Based on those scriptures—the truths found in Shruti—the systems, laws, customs, and traditions of society were developed; these are called Smritis. Shrutis are typically considered as Prasthana Trayi. There are three legs of Shruti. One is the Upanishads, which we have all learned.\n\nThey come at the end of the Vedas. Vedas generally describe all types of sciences which are utilitarian or material in nature—things one can use in his lifetime. But at the end of the Vedas, there are dialogues between students and teachers. They are called Upanishads. They deal with the fundamental questions we all ask, knowingly or unknowingly: Who am I? Is there someone who has control over my life, and what is my relationship with that controller?\n\nSo these are dialogues between students and teachers, set in the serene environment of Himalayan valleys. Both students and teachers are highly evolved seekers. The teacher is a realized master who has gone through his Sadhana and realized the truth. The student is also a highly evolved seeker who has gone through Sadhana and is now finding his final answers.\n\nThe truths in Srutis are immutable. Rather, they cannot be changed over a period of time, from one age to another. The Shruti does not change. The truths revealed in Srutis do not change. Smriti, on the other hand, are the laws created by society, by the leaders of the society. The lawmakers in the society are adaptable to the new environment in the society.\n\nSo the two mains we hear about are Parasara and Manusmriti. Mainly manusmriti is the one which we hear most, we heard most about. In fact, if I'm not mistaken, the laws in India before independence and somewhat after the independence were structured based on Manusmriti. Laws for Hindus were Hindu laws and they were based on Manusmriti. And laws for Muslims were based on Syria. So the Manusmriti was considered the code of conduct for the society.\n\nAs we know, we don't apply Manusmriti as-is in our society now. Even in India, the laws have changed, society has changed. The basic structure may remain what Manusmriti says, but many things we have updated to fit our current needs. On the other hand, the facts revealed in Shruti are unchangeable. It is something like mathematics—I can use mathematics in my life from childhood to old age, depending on my own needs, and I'll interpret mathematics accordingly.\n\nBut the fundamentals of mathematics do not change. 2+2 remained 4 when I was in kindergarten; it still remains 4 when I'm an old man and consider myself a wise person. The spiritual tenets in Shruti are like those rules—unchangeable. They remain constant no matter how you look at it or try to prove it. But the application of those laws can change according to society. The way I used mathematics in my childhood is different from how I used it as a high school student, then as a college student, and then as a professional.\n\nMy applications are different based on my own situation. So Smritis are like those adaptable sciences which we can update as we go along in our society. The fundamentals of Manusmriti may remain the same, but the application is completely changed in our society now. So there are three aspects of the Shruti: the Upanishads as we talked about, Brahma Sutra, and third is Bhagavad Gita. Bhagavad Gita is considered an Upanishad by itself.\n\nTherefore, at the end of every chapter we say \"Upanishadsu Bhagavad Gita.\" It's considered an Upanishad by itself because it reveals the truths found in Shruti. But the uniqueness of Bhagavad Gita is that it is also considered Smriti—it's a combination of Shruti and Smriti. Therefore it has a unique place in Prasthana Trayi.\n\nIn Prasthana Trayi, if you just learn Upanishads, they are transcendental. They transcend my day-to-day life, telling me what the ultimate truth is and how it relates to me. And they are set in a very serene environment, as I said before. Bhagavad Gita, on the other hand, is set in a completely different environment. It's still a dialogue between a student and a teacher.\n\nBut here the student and teacher are not a great master and a lowly seeker trying to understand. They were two friends—a dialogue between two friends, two cousins. One was great, but he did not act like one when it comes to his friendship. So it's a dialogue between two equals, set in an environment completely different from Himalayan valleys—it's on the battlefield. Some commentators think that the whole Mahabharata was written by Bhagavan Ved Vyas.\n\nTo have a platform for Bhagavad Gita, he had to have a proper background to convert it into a scripture that can guide mankind. The entire Mahabharata, which is a hundred thousand verses as we now know it, originally started out as a book called Jaya with only 24,000 verses. But it did have Bhagavad Gita in it. Bhagavad Gita is the central crown jewel of Mahabharata. Mahabharata became the greatest epic of all times for Hindu culture, for India, and for the world because of Bhagavad Gita. Remove Bhagavad Gita and Mahabharata becomes another story of a Kuru clan.\n\nAt the same token, remove Mahabharata and Bhagavad Gita becomes merely poetry, something similar to Upanishads. They have a symbiotic relationship. Mahabharata converts Bhagavad Gita into a Smriti which can be used in day-to-day life. Mahabharata gives us the background of human society—human conditions, human aspirations, human shortcomings. It is generally said that Mahabharata contains all human situations. If you don't find a situation in Mahabharata, it does not exist.\n\nYou may find any situation from Mahabharata in other works of art, but not the other way around. So Mahabharata sets the stage, and we all know the story—the cousins Kauravas and Pandavas were fighting for their rights, and Duryodhana said he's not giving even a square inch of land, even though rightfully Pandavas were the claimants for that kingdom. The war is about to begin, and we are now going to see a dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna.\n\nIn the first chapter, called Arjuna Vishada Yoga, there are no great philosophical revelations, so one should not seek philosophical explanations in Chapter 1. Bhagavan Shankaracharya in his Gita Bhashya does not start his commentary until verse 11 of Chapter 2. He didn't think it was worth his time to talk about Chapter 1 and the first 10 verses of Chapter 2.\n\nBut for us common folks, context is very important. Without context, we lose the meaning of what we are discussing. Chapter 1 gives us the context for the dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna.\n\nKrishna and Arjuna are the two main characters in this dialogue, but there are two other people involved in Bhagavad Gita: Dhritarashtra and Sanjaya. Dhritarashtra, as we know, was the King of Hastinapur. Duryodhana and the other Kauravas were his sons, and he could have avoided this war by just his own declaration—but he did not. He was blind from birth and therefore was not considered worthy of being king. But because of the situation with Pandu, the younger son, he was made the caretaker king, and Duryodhana became the effective king—like MBS in Saudi Arabia.\n\nDuryodhana was the one actually making the decisions, and he obviously was not going to give up the kingdom he had already been enjoying for so many years. When the war is about to begin, Dhritarashtra is still sitting in the palace because he's not taking part in the war, but he's curious about what's going on. He knew that the Kaurava side has 11 Akshauhini Sena and the Pandavas have 7—so 11 plus 7 is 18. You will see that 18 is the magic number: there are 18 books in Mahabharata, the war lasted 18 days, and there are 18 chapters in Bhagavad Gita.\n\nApparently one Akshauhini has 21,870 chariots, the same number of elephants, three times that of horses, and five times that of foot soldiers. If you take any of these numbers and add their digits, they will add up to 18. Take 21,870 and add up the digits—it adds up to 18. Multiply that by three, and the digits add up to 18 again. Multiply by five—same result.\n\nIf you do the math, there were about 4 million people on that battlefield. Now, I've never been to Kurukshetra, so I can't tell you it's large enough to hold 4 million people. But according to this calculation, about 4 million soldiers were ready to fight. The war is about to begin. Dhritarashtra knew that his side is much stronger—11 Akshauhini versus Pandava's 7.\n\nBut he also knew who is on the right side and who was on the wrong side. That gives you a little pause in thinking about what is going to happen. He wanted to know what's going on, and he had an opportunity. The day before, Bhagavan Vyasa stopped by his palace and said, \"You really need to see what's happening, and I can give you divine vision so that you can see it.\" But he said, \"I'm comfortable in my blindness. I really don't want to see.\"\n\n\"But if you are really kind enough, give it to my minister Sanjaya.\" So Sanjaya got the Divya Drishti, the divine vision. Now, we do not know how all that happened. Maybe Sanjaya was on the battlefield and reported back. But it is believed that Sanjaya had this divine vision—not only could he see things happening on the battlefield, but he could also see what's going on in people's minds. He can hear, he can see, and he can perceive.\n\nTherefore it's called Divya Drishti—he has much greater capacity than an average person. Ati Drishti means he can see even further than a normal person. Dhritarashtra knew that Sanjaya can see everything. So the very first verse starts with \"Dhritarashtra Uvacha.\" Notice that Bhagavad Gita did not start with \"Krishna Uvacha\" or \"Bhagavan Uvacha\" or \"Arjuna Uvacha.\" It started with Dhritarashtra, the blind king. These characters are there in Chapter 1 and in Mahabharata.\n\nSo we can identify with the situation. I may not be able to identify with Arjuna, but I can probably identify with Dhritarashtra as a father. Maybe I have done something that Dhritarashtra did, and therefore suffered.",
      "reflection": "These verses enumerate the mighty Pandava warriors: Yuyudhana (Satyaki), Virata, Drupada, Dhrishtaketu, Chekitana, the King of Kashi, Purujit, Kuntibhoja, Shaibya, Yudhamanyu, Uttamaujas, Abhimanyu, and the sons of Draupadi—all described as \"maharathas\" (great chariot warriors). Notice that Duryodhana is reciting this list not to his commander Bhishma, but to his teacher Drona. This reveals his anxiety: he's essentially saying, \"Look at all these students you trained who are now fighting against us.\" When we feel insecure about our position, we often seek validation from those we hope to influence.\n\nReflect on times when you've enumerated your competitors' strengths to someone whose loyalty you questioned. Perhaps before a presentation, you listed all the reasons the other team might win, hoping for reassurance. This is the Duryodhana pattern—anxiety masquerading as assessment. The Gita shows us that true security doesn't come from counting resources or comparing strengths, but from alignment with dharma.\n\nConsider also the teaching embedded in Bhagavad Gita's structure: it is both Shruti (revealed scripture revealing eternal truths) and Smriti (remembered wisdom applicable to daily life). Unlike the Upanishads set in serene Himalayan valleys, this dialogue unfolds on a battlefield between two friends and cousins. What battles are you facing right now in your workplace, family, or inner life? The Gita meets us not in some ideal spiritual environment, but precisely where we are—in the midst of our conflicts, confusions, and competing loyalties. How might you bring the wisdom of scripture to your own \"Kurukshetra\" today?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 1, Arjuna Vishada Yoga—the Yoga of Arjuna's Grief. As we discussed before, this is a chapter which gives us the context for the dialogue between Arjuna and Krishna. Bhagavad Gita is part of the Prasthana Trayi, one of the three legs of our philosophy: the Upanishads, Brahma Sutra, and Bhagavad Gita. Bhagavad Gita has a unique place, as we have discussed—it is not only a Shruti because it reveals the Brahma Vidya, but it is also applicable for day-to-day living and social order. Therefore it is also considered Smriti. In that context, we're seeing Chapter 1 as a study in how different people react to the same situation.\n\nWe started this Bhagavad Gita with Dhritarashtra's query to Sanjaya: \"What's happening at the battlefield?\" Dharmakshetra, Kurukshetra, Mamakaha, Pandavaschain. The very first thing we notice is how Dhritarashtra thinks—this world is divided into mine and yours, mine and the rest of the world. \"Mamakaha\"—mine, and Pandava's. This is the central issue we deal with in philosophy: in our Advaita philosophy, the root cause of all our problems is duality. This duality—I as an island by myself, and the world out there—creates friction between I and the world. The very first indication, the first word, tells us where we stand.\n\nWe are in the Dhrutrastra Sthiti. We see this world as I, mine and rest. And then as we further go into the chapter we see Sanjay's narration. Sanjaya starts his narration with what is Duryodhan doing? So we are seeing now the world from Duryodhan's perspective, same situation. The two armies are facing each other.\n\nWar is about to be started. We all know the background of why they are there very elaborately. The Mahabharata describes what happened before we came to this point of two armies facing each other. Now Duryodhana is looking at the situation. He sees it from a very different perspective: Is this winnable or not? Am I in a winning position or a losing position?\n\nThe same situation—as we'll see further in the chapter—Arjuna looks at very differently. He looks at it as whether it's right or wrong to be here. So it gives us various perspectives on how we look at our lives. When we face any situation, depending on our own mental condition, we look at it that way. Swamiji used to say the scriptures are nothing but the mirror of our mind. Every time we read the scriptures, we see our own reflection in it. So we have seen that Sanjaya first says that, looking at the Pandava army, Raja Duryodhana went to Drona and told him thus.\n\nAnd then he described what he told Drona. First of all, as we know, the commander-in-chief on the Kaurava side was Bheeshma; on the Pandava side, Drishtadyumna, Drupada's son. So if Duryodhana had any question, doubt, or concern, he should have gone to Bheeshma and said, \"Let's make sure we are in a winning position.\" But instead, he goes to Drona, his teacher. It seems he felt there was a soft spot. Drona is as powerful as Bheeshma and Arjuna in terms of his prowess in warfare.\n\nBut he knew that he has soft spot for his students. Every teacher has soft spot for his or her best student. Arjuna was Drona's best student. Not only that, all other people who are the great warriors on the other side are Drona's student. So he is now questioning whether he will be at his best when Drona fights this war. It seems therefore he goes to Drona and tells him look at the army on the Pandava side.\n\nIt is commanded by an able commander like Drishtadyumna, your wise student. Then he said all of them are your students—they know as much as you know, or you are the one who trained them. So we have seen in the first six verses he describes who are on the Pandava side. Then the next six verses, he describes who are on our side. But now he is putting it in a way which seems slightly odd: he says \"Asmakam tu Vishishta ye Tanibodha Dvijottama.\"\n\nHe addresses Drona as \"Dvijottama\"—best among Brahmins. But he is not here as a Brahmin; here he is a warrior. Drona, even though he was born a Brahmin, spent his life in the art of warfare and became the greatest teacher. That's why Bhishma actually replaced Kripacharya, who was supposed to be the Raj Guru—he realized that Drona is a better teacher for his grandchildren, all Kauravas and Pandavas.\n\nSo Drona was the best. But here Duryodhana goes to him and says, \"Oh, best among the Brahmins.\" It seems like a compliment, but it's a backhanded compliment—at the end of the day, you're a Brahmin. And Brahmins are known to be softer; they can't tolerate physical or mental torture or agonies. There's a story in Mahabharata about Karna.\n\nKarna goes to Parashuram because he wanted to learn. He disguised himself as a Brahmin, because Parashuram wouldn't teach anyone but Brahmins—Parashuram had taken a vow to wipe out all Kshatriyas from this planet. So Karna disguised himself, and it went well. But one day, a worm was biting Karna's thigh and he started bleeding. His teacher was sleeping with his head on Karna's lap.\n\nThe blood started going under Parashuram's head. He felt this hot blood, woke up, and realized what had happened. He said, \"You are not a Brahmin. You cannot be a Brahmin if you can tolerate that much pain without moving.\" As we see from this story, Brahmins are known to be softer. \"Dvijottama\"—essentially calling him a soft person.\n\nSo he's saying: \"Asmakam tu Vishishta\"—be aware that even on our side, the warriors are not ordinary; they are better than normal. \"Nayaka Mama Sainyasya\"—the leaders in my army. See the words—\"mama,\" \"mamakaha\"—on one side.\n\nThat is the root cause of my problems. \"Nayaka Mama Sainyasya Sanjnartham Tan Bravimi Te\"—I'm going to enumerate who the special leaders in our army are. There was no reason whatsoever for Drona to know any of this. He already knew, and it wasn't even Drona's business to worry about. He had his own position and duties.\n\nBhishma was the one who had to worry about who is where. But he is telling Drona—he seems to be suffering from anxiety about whether this war is winnable or not. He's getting a little worried. This is what happens when we go for a presentation and we know there are three national firms we're competing against. We start looking at our strong points: \"Look, our strong point is that we are local, then we have this, and we have that.\"\n\nThis shows our anxiety—how are we going to win this thing when we are fighting against a mightier competitor? So here he is enumerating who are on his side to Drona, which shows his anxiety about whether the war is winnable or not, even though he had the larger army. It also tells us that acquiring and accomplishing more things will not make us more secure—which is how we live our lives. \"The more I'll acquire, the more secure I will be; the larger the bank balance, the more my retirement will be secured.\"\n\nIt's actually the other way around. The more I acquire and accomplish, the more insecure I become, because my expectations from life grow more and more. I start relying on my accomplishments and achievements, and I see a long way to go to be perfect. I was talking to my investment advisors: \"What is the guarantee that you will be able to protect my nest egg 20 years from now?\" There are no guarantees.\n\nIf I never had that much money to worry about 20 years from now, who worries? Whatever it is, but because at least something that I worry about. So more I acquire, more insecure I become. That's the lesson we learn from this. So he's now insecure and now he says I'm going to enumerate what are our assets. These are our assets.\n\nWhat is our liability? Our liability is all your students on this side. But at the same token our assets. Bhavan, starting with you, you are one of my assets. Bhavan Bhishmas cha—\"yourself and Bhishma, and also Karna and Kripa, Samatinjaya.\" Swamiji points out that Duryodhana adds an adjective to Kripacharya: \"Samatinjaya—victorious in war.\" Dronacharya knew who Kripacharya was—his brother-in-law who had been replaced by Drona as teacher by Bhishma. Now Duryodhana is calling him \"the victorious one.\" This shows Duryodhana's anxiety and his attempt to make Dronacharya feel more loyal and faithful to him. Then he lists Ashvatthama, Drona's son, Vikarna, and Somadatta's son. So he enumerated these people starting from you—Drona.\n\nHe wanted to make him feel like you are important. Just make sure that your loyalty is not divided between Pandavas and us. Because your students are there. Your best student is on other side. But I consider you as my asset. Then he continues and says, a Nyecha Baha vah Suraha, Madharte Takta, Jeevi taha.\n\nThere are many others, great warriors. They are willing to give their lives for me. So it's all about me. You can see in these verses. There's more mama in it than anything else. He's not describing anything which is of value to Drona.\n\nHe's not describing any strategy. Let's make sure that we all understood what our game plan is. He's just simply saying, look how we are in a better situation. Because I am at the center of this and everybody is fighting for me. They are ready to give their lives for me. Nana, Sastra, Prahananah, Sarvey, Yudda, Vishaaradaha.\n\nThey're all expert in weapons of various kinds and missiles. Something which you throw is a Prahana, a pariyaptam. So this verse in verse 10 is important to understand. \"Aparyaptam tad asmakam balam Bhishma abhiraksitam, paryaptam tvidam etesham balam Bhima abhiraksitam.\" Now Duryodhana gives his conclusion after evaluating who is on the Pandava's side and who is on our side. Swamiji mentions that there are two interpretations here.\n\nOne interpretation: \"Aparyaptam\"—our army seems unlimited, because it's so huge and protected by Bhishma, it seems plenty. \"Paryaptam tvidam etesham balam\"—and the army protected by Bhima seems limited, not large enough. We are in a winning situation. I'm not exactly sure why Duryodhana names Bhima instead of Dhrishtadyumna who was the actual commander, but Bhima. The simple explanation is that Duryodhana's direct rival is Bhima, because both were mace warriors.\n\nEveryone who reads Bhagavad Gita comes up with their own interpretation. Different Acharyas who follow Advaita, Vishishta Advaita, or Dvaita philosophy—all of them have looked at Bhagavad Gita and reached their own conclusions. Even though the Dhyana Shloka says \"Advaita Amruta Varshini Ashtadasa Adhyayini\"—clearly describing it as the showerer of Advaita philosophy—we still have these different interpretations.\n\nSo here is one way to look at this verse. If Duryodhana feels this is a winnable situation, he will say we have an unlimited army. The 11 akshauhinis versus 7 is the perfect combination for victory.",
      "reflection": "In these verses, Duryodhana addresses Drona as \"Dvijottama\"—best among the twice-born Brahmins. Though this sounds like a compliment, Swamiji points out it's actually a subtle accusation: \"Remember, you're just a Brahmin—soft by nature, with divided loyalties to your students on both sides.\" Notice how Duryodhana lists his own generals—\"Bhavan\" (yourself), Bhishma, Karna, Kripa, Ashwatthama, Vikarna, Somadatta—not to strategize, but to reassure himself. He says these warriors are ready to give their lives \"madarthe\"—for my sake. The repeated use of \"mama\" (mine) reveals his self-centered view of the entire conflict.\n\nReflect on your own patterns of seeking reassurance when facing challenges. Do you enumerate your \"assets\" to others when you're actually trying to convince yourself? Do you subtly question the loyalty of those around you, revealing your own insecurity rather than any real deficiency in them? Duryodhana had eleven akshauhinis—a massive army—yet couldn't feel secure. This teaches us that acquiring more accomplishments, wealth, or allies doesn't bring lasting security. In fact, as Swamiji notes, \"More I acquire, more insecure I become, because my expectations from life become more and more.\"\n\nThis week, notice where you're seeking external validation for decisions you've already made internally. When you find yourself listing your strengths or resources to others, pause and ask: \"Am I strategizing, or am I managing my own anxiety?\" The difference matters. True confidence comes not from counting what's on your side, but from knowing your cause is aligned with dharma."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 1, Arjuna Vishada Yoga—the Yoga of Arjuna's Grief. As we discussed before, this is a chapter which gives us the context for the dialogue between Arjuna and Krishna. Bhagavad Gita is part of the Prasthana Trayi, one of the three legs of our philosophy: the Upanishads, Brahma Sutra, and Bhagavad Gita. Bhagavad Gita has a unique place, as we have discussed—it is not only a Shruti because it reveals the Brahma Vidya, but it is also applicable for day-to-day living and social order. Therefore it is also considered Smriti. In that context, we're seeing Chapter 1 as a study in how different people react to the same situation.\n\nWe started this Bhagavad Gita with Dhritarashtra's query to Sanjaya: \"What's happening at the battlefield?\" Dharmakshetra, Kurukshetra, Mamakaha, Pandavaschain. The very first thing we notice is how Dhritarashtra thinks—this world is divided into mine and yours, mine and the rest of the world. \"Mamakaha\"—mine, and Pandava's. This is the central issue we deal with in philosophy: in our Advaita philosophy, the root cause of all our problems is duality. This duality—I as an island by myself, and the world out there—creates friction between I and the world. The very first indication, the first word, tells us where we stand.\n\nWe are in the Dhrutrastra Sthiti. We see this world as I, mine and rest. And then as we further go into the chapter we see Sanjay's narration. Sanjaya starts his narration with what is Duryodhan doing? So we are seeing now the world from Duryodhan's perspective, same situation. The two armies are facing each other.\n\nWar is about to be started. We all know the background of why they are there very elaborately. The Mahabharata describes what happened before we came to this point of two armies facing each other. Now Duryodhana is looking at the situation. He sees it from a very different perspective: Is this winnable or not? Am I in a winning position or a losing position?\n\nThe same situation—as we'll see further in the chapter—Arjuna looks at very differently. He looks at it as whether it's right or wrong to be here. So it gives us various perspectives on how we look at our lives. When we face any situation, depending on our own mental condition, we look at it that way. Swamiji used to say the scriptures are nothing but the mirror of our mind. Every time we read the scriptures, we see our own reflection in it. So we have seen that Sanjaya first says that, looking at the Pandava army, Raja Duryodhana went to Drona and told him thus.\n\nAnd then he described what he told Drona. First of all, as we know, the commander-in-chief on the Kaurava side was Bheeshma; on the Pandava side, Drishtadyumna, Drupada's son. So if Duryodhana had any question, doubt, or concern, he should have gone to Bheeshma and said, \"Let's make sure we are in a winning position.\" But instead, he goes to Drona, his teacher. It seems he felt there was a soft spot. Drona is as powerful as Bheeshma and Arjuna in terms of his prowess in warfare.\n\nBut he knew that he has soft spot for his students. Every teacher has soft spot for his or her best student. Arjuna was Drona's best student. Not only that, all other people who are the great warriors on the other side are Drona's student. So he is now questioning whether he will be at his best when Drona fights this war. It seems therefore he goes to Drona and tells him look at the army on the Pandava side.\n\nIt is commanded by an able commander like Drishtadyumna, your wise student. Then he said all of them are your students—they know as much as you know, or you are the one who trained them. So we have seen in the first six verses he describes who are on the Pandava side. Then the next six verses, he describes who are on our side. But now he is putting it in a way which seems slightly odd: he says \"Asmakam tu Vishishta ye Tanibodha Dvijottama.\"\n\nHe addresses Drona as \"Dvijottama\"—best among Brahmins. But he is not here as a Brahmin; here he is a warrior. Drona, even though he was born a Brahmin, spent his life in the art of warfare and became the greatest teacher. That's why Bhishma actually replaced Kripacharya, who was supposed to be the Raj Guru—he realized that Drona is a better teacher for his grandchildren, all Kauravas and Pandavas.\n\nSo Drona was the best. But here Duryodhana goes to him and says, \"Oh, best among the Brahmins.\" It seems like a compliment, but it's a backhanded compliment—at the end of the day, you're a Brahmin. And Brahmins are known to be softer; they can't tolerate physical or mental torture or agonies. There's a story in Mahabharata about Karna.\n\nKarna goes to Parashuram because he wanted to learn. He disguised himself as a Brahmin, because Parashuram wouldn't teach anyone but Brahmins—Parashuram had taken a vow to wipe out all Kshatriyas from this planet. So Karna disguised himself, and it went well. But one day, a worm was biting Karna's thigh and he started bleeding. His teacher was sleeping with his head on Karna's lap.\n\nThe blood started going under Parashuram's head. He felt this hot blood, woke up, and realized what had happened. He said, \"You are not a Brahmin. You cannot be a Brahmin if you can tolerate that much pain without moving.\" As we see from this story, Brahmins are known to be softer. \"Dvijottama\"—essentially calling him a soft person.\n\nSo he's saying: \"Asmakam tu Vishishta\"—be aware that even on our side, the warriors are not ordinary; they are better than normal. \"Nayaka Mama Sainyasya\"—the leaders in my army. See the words—\"mama,\" \"mamakaha\"—on one side.\n\nThat is the root cause of my problems. \"Nayaka Mama Sainyasya Sanjnartham Tan Bravimi Te\"—I'm going to enumerate who the special leaders in our army are. There was no reason whatsoever for Drona to know any of this. He already knew, and it wasn't even Drona's business to worry about. He had his own position and duties.\n\nBhishma was the one who had to worry about who is where. But he is telling Drona—he seems to be suffering from anxiety about whether this war is winnable or not. He's getting a little worried.

Whatever it is, but because at least something that I worry about. So more I acquire, more insecure I become. That's the lesson we learn from this. So he's now insecure and now he says I'm going to enumerate what are our assets. These are our assets.\n\nWhat is our liability? Our liability is all your students on this side. But at the same token our assets. Bhavan, starting with you, you are one of my assets. Bhavan Bismast and also Bisma Karna Krupascha Samatinjaya Swamiji points out that he adds an adjective to Krupacharya Samatinjoya. Victorious Dronacharya knew who Krupacharya is.\n\nHe was his brother in law, you know, replaced by him as a teacher by Bheeshma. Now Duryoda is telling him he's the victorious one. Victorious Kripacharya. It shows his anxieties and worry and trying to make Dronacharya be more loyal and faithful to him. Asvathama his son, he knew asvathama Vikranscha, Soma Datta, Tatha, evacha. So he enumerated these people starting from you.\n\nHe wanted to make him feel like you are important. Just make sure that your loyalty is not divided between Pandavas and us. Because your students are there. Your best student is on other side. But I consider you as my asset. Then he continues and says, a Nyecha Baha vah Suraha, Madharte Takta, Jeevi taha.\n\nThere are many others, great warriors. They are willing to give their lives for me. So it's all about me. You can see in these verses. There's more mama in it than anything else. He's not describing anything which is of value to Drona.\n\nHe's not describing any strategy. Let's make sure that we all understood what our game plan is. He's just simply saying, look how we are in a better situation. Because I am at the center of this and everybody is fighting for me. They are ready to give their lives for me. Nana, Sastra, Prahananah, Sarvey, Yudda, Vishaaradaha.\n\nThey're all expert in weapons of various kinds and missiles. Something which you throw is a Prahana, a pariyaptam. So verse 10 is important to understand. \"Aparyaptam tad asmakam balam Bhishma abhiraksitam, paryaptam tvidam etesham balam Bhima abhiraksitam.\" Now Duryodhana gives his conclusion after evaluating who is on the Pandava's side and who is on our side. Swamiji mentions that there are two interpretations here.\n\nOne interpretation: \"Aparyaptam\"—our army seems unlimited, because it's so huge and protected by Bhishma, it seems plenty. \"Paryaptam tvidam etesham balam\"—and the army protected by Bhima seems limited, not large enough. We are in a winning situation. I'm not exactly sure why Duryodhana names Bhima instead of Dhrishtadyumna who was the actual commander.

If Duryodhana feels this is a winnable situation, he will say we have an unlimited army. The 11 akshauhinis versus 7 is the perfect combination for victory.",
      "reflection": "Verse 10 contains an intriguing ambiguity: \"Aparyaptam\" can mean either \"unlimited\" (our army is so vast) or \"insufficient\" (our army is not enough). This wordplay captures Duryodhana's conflicted mind perfectly—he oscillates between arrogance and anxiety. Notice how he compares armies by their protectors: his side guarded by Bhishma, the Pandavas by Bhima. Interestingly, he names Bhima rather than the actual commander Dhrishtadyumna, revealing that his real rival—the one who haunts his thoughts—is Bhima, his equal in mace warfare.\n\nThen comes Bhishma's response in verse 12: seeing Duryodhana's nervous energy spreading to the troops, the grandsire \"roared like a lion and blew his conch\" to cheer them up. This is true leadership—recognizing when anxiety is contagious and acting decisively to shift the energy. Bhishma doesn't engage with Duryodhana's insecurity; he simply signals that it's time to begin.\n\nReflect on situations where you've been like Duryodhana—simultaneously boasting about your resources while secretly doubting their sufficiency. Notice how this anxiety affects those around you. Then consider: who are the Bhishmas in your life, the wise elders who cut through uncertainty with decisive action? And when might you need to be that person for others? Sometimes the most helpful response to collective anxiety isn't more analysis or reassurance, but a clear signal that it's time to move forward. What \"conch\" might you need to blow in your own life to shift from deliberation to action?"

      ],
      "commentary": "We are now discussing Chapter 1, Arjuna Vishada Yoga—the Yoga of Arjuna's Grief. In the first 12 verses we have seen so far that Dhritarashtra is very anxious to know what's happening with his sons and Pandu's sons. \"Mamakaha Pandavaschaiva\"—so in the very first verse we see the cause for this war. Dhritarashtra was the guardian after Pandu died for Pandu's sons. When you assign a guardian to take care of children, that guardian is responsible for their welfare and well-being and to protect their interests. That's the job of a guardian. Dhritarashtra, being the Emperor and the uncle of Pandu's sons, was assigned to take care of them.\n\nIt was Dhritarashtra's duty to treat Pandu's children as his own, because he was the guardian. But we clearly see how he had a distinction in his mind between his sons and Pandu's sons. \"Mamakaha Pandavaschaiva\"—that is the cause for this conflict in life. We see that conflict occurs only when someone is not doing his or her duty. Conflicts are there because someone assigned a duty is not doing it, whether it is you or the other. Therefore you also have \"Dharmakshetra Kurukshetra\" here.\n\nThe goal for this war is to establish Dharma again—to re-establish Dharma. Conflict occurs because there is a violation of Dharma somewhere. Who is responsible? One has to figure out.\n\nIn the next 11 verses, we have seen what's happening with three of them. Dhritarashtra was very anxious to know what's going on because he obviously wasn't really sure. Duryodhana, in a similar situation, has his own doubts about the loyalty of his own people and generals. He knew for sure that his cause is not validated by all the great generals in his army; he cannot feel comfortable.\n\nThey are completely loyal to him. Their loyalties may be divided. They are on my side because of their employment, that they are employed by the kingdom but their hearts may be on the other side. It is quite well known that Arjuna was Drona's favorite student. Bheeshma liked Pandavas more than the Kauravas, so he wasn't sure. So the cause of anxiety which we see here is my own failure to follow my own Dharma.\n\nSo all these 12 verses tell us that conflict only occurs when Dharma is violated, and your peace of mind is shattered only when Dharma is violated. When you don't follow your Dharma, your mental peace will be disturbed. We see in Duryodhana that he's suffering from anxiety, and his first target was Drona, because it was quite obvious that Drona has a soft corner for Arjuna and the Pandavas. We have seen his behavior—he enumerates who are on their side and our side, whether our army is enough or not enough. Now we are seeing Bhishma. Bhishma, being the guardian of Hastinapur's throne.\n\nNo matter what the situation, he had the duty to keep the army motivated. He realized that if he leaves this situation any longer, not only is Duryodhana going down, but he's going to bring everybody else down with him—Drona and whoever else he is addressing. So in verse 12, he said \"Tasya Sanjanayan Harsham\"—to cheer them up to fight this battle. \"Simhanadam vinadya ucchaih shankham dadhmau pratapavan.\" He roared like a lion and then blew his own conch.\n\nSo we have discussed last time the declaration of the war. Bheeshma has also come to the conclusion that this conflict can only be settled by this war. Dharma can only be established by just fighting this war. And therefore let's get it done. So he blew his own conch. And now we see the reaction, Quick response from everybody.\n\nAs soon as Bheeshma blew his own conch, everybody else blew their own conches. There was a great sound—everybody playing their kettledrums and cow-horns. Now, there is a reason why armies used to carry those kettledrums. We also know that sound has its own effect. When you go to a disco, the beats, as the yoga teacher will say, will activate your Muladhara chakra—they will make you dance whether you want to or not. As soon as the beat starts, you start dancing.\n\nSo the sound has its own effect in changing your mental makeup. So this great sound will put you into frenzy to do something. So that as soon as the leader has announced that we are ready, everybody else supported and said we are ready too. We have seen the response by the army. Now here interesting thing to note is Bhagavan Vedvyas does not enumerate all the Kauravas generals who blew their conscience. But he does enumerate the Pandavas Tathahas, Swetaihi Hayehi, Yukte Mahati, Syandanesh, Titao, Madhavah, Pandavah, Chayeva, Divya, Sankam, Pradhadvatuhu.\n\nThe very first response comes from Madhav seated in the great chariot yoked by white horses. Pandav Arjun Pandu's son. Pandav here is Arjun Divya, Sankhopra, Dhatma. They believe their own divine conscience. Bhagavan Vedvyas didn't say first. Drishtadhamna did that because he was the chief of the army.\n\nYudhishthir not an Arjun Madhavah. The one person who was really keen in establishing Dharma in Aryavarth was Krishna. He has concluded that this conflict cannot be settled. All the arrogance of Kauravas and their mistreatment to the people will only stop if they are stopped in their tracks. The only way to stop them is to have this war. So the first response actually came from Madhava, Krishna, who had decided he's not going to take up arms himself.\n\nHe said, \"I'm not fighting.\" So sometimes without fighting directly, you can still fight the battle. The lesson to be learned here is you don't have to be always actively making noise. You can very silently win the war. Both Madhava and Pandava Arjuna blew their own divine conches. Bhagavan Vedvyasa seems somewhat biased here. He didn't say the conches on the other side were divine, but he specifically said the Pandava conches were divine.\n\nWhat this means is their cause was divine—to fight this war. Their cause was not driven by their own arrogance or self-interest. Their cause was driven by establishing Dharma. \"Panchajanyam Hrishikesha, Devadattam Dhananjaya, Paundram dadhmau mahasankham Bhima karma Vrikodara.\" Hrishikesha, Lord Krishna, blew his great Panchajanya conch. So the conches were also named probably the sounds were unique from each other. So you can know whose conch is being blown.\n\nIt is more like, you know, I don't see that now, but when we were in Africa. So sitting in your apartment, you know whose car has come just by the noise, you know, the noise the car makes. You know, that must be Harish coming here. Oh, that sounds like Mazda. I think that Neel Kante from the sound of that, you can recognize who is that. So in this great war, you don't know who is where, but with your conch, you can let the other person know where you are.\n\nYour position can be determined by the sound of your conch. That's the way of communication. I think the yodeling in Scandinavia may be a way of communicating. So this conches were for communication. So each one has own signature conch sound. So they know who is where in this formation of this army, how far he is from Panchajanyam.\n\nHrishikesha—Swamiji comments here that Krishna's conch was called Panchajanya because it was made from a demon called Panchajana. There seems to be some philosophical meaning here. The conch which Krishna is blowing was born out of a demon with five attributes—the five senses. Krishna blows his own conch, working through an instrument made up of the five senses. So it's Panchajanya for Krishna. Devadattam for Arjuna—Devadatta.\n\nIndra gave him this conch—it was a gift from his father Indra. Devadattam Dhananjaya. Paundram dadhmau mahasankham Bhima karma Vrikodara. Vrikodara means \"wolf-bellied\"—Bhima. Because he can eat as much as he wants and still digest it like a wolf. \"Bhimakarma\"—a play on his own name, meaning the one who is capable of doing terrible deeds.\n\nHe blew his own great conch named Paundra. \"Anantavijayam raja Kuntiputra Yudhishthira\"—King Yudhishthira, son of Kunti, blew his own conch called Anantavijaya—Eternal Victory. Because he is Dharmaraja, his victory is in establishing truth. And truth has eternal victory.\n\nSo therefore his conch is named Anantavijaya. \"Nakula Sahadeva cha Sughosha Manipushpakau\"—Nakula and Sahadeva also blew their conches, and they reflect their own personalities. Nakula was a fashionable one, therefore his conch is Sughosha—sweet-sounding. Manipushpaka, decorated like a jewel, was Sahadeva's.\n\nOne was a fashion icon, another was an expert with horses. So their conches also reflect their personalities. \"Kashya cha parameshvasa, Shikhandi cha maharatha, Dhrishtadyumna, Virata cha, Satyaki cha aparajita\"—and all the others, such as the King of Kashi who is a great archer, Shikhandi the mighty warrior. Shikhandi was transgender. So you can see that having transgender soldiers is not just a modern military issue.\n\nAnd they had the same issue whether Shikhandi can fight or not. But Pandavas were open minded. Shikhandi never changed his gender. He was born as a girl. And Drupad raised him as a girl. But allowed to fight in the army because they did not discriminate between who can fight in the army whether men or women.\n\nBut Shikhandi, from all accepted description he changed his gender. He was born as a girl. His mother raised her as a boy. Because Drupad wanted a son to fight Drona. But it turned out to be a girl. So he was raised as a son.\n\nAnd then at some point he left his house because after he got married it created a problem. So he left and then changed his gender. As per the Puranas, he was Amba reborn as Shikhandini. His name was Shikhandini when he was a girl, and then Shikhandi when he became a man. Also listed are Dhrishtadyumna, Drupada's other son, Virata, and Satyaki the unconquered.\n\nSatyaki was actually from Krishna's side. Krishna gave his army to Duryodhana, but not all the generals decided to join that side. Some of them decided they wouldn't take the army but they also wouldn't fight there. Satyaki was one of them.\n\nHe decided to fight from the Pandava side. We know the story of Virata and Dhrishtadyumna. Dhrishtadyumna's only goal in life was to kill Drona to take his father's revenge. So you see, Shikhandi's goal is to kill Bhishma, and Dhrishtadyumna's goal is to kill Drona. So they are mentioned here—just as Drona and Bhishma are on the Kaurava side, the two people who are determined to kill them are on this side.\n\n\"Drupada Draupadeyascha sarvashah prithivipate, Saubhadra cha mahabahu\"—and then all the other people, O King of the earth. Prithivipate here is addressed to Dhritarashtra. Drupada and Draupadi's sons and Saubhadra (Abhimanyu), the mighty-armed—all these great warriors blew their conches. \"Shankhan dadhmuh prithak prithak\"—they blew their own conches separately. Blowing one's own conch is like expressing one's own opinion. Everyone has to have their own opinion.\n\nSo when we are in a meeting somewhere, if you are not having a chance to have your own opinion, that meeting is worthless for you. Everyone has to express their own opinion. Now if everybody is doing it in an orderly manner, it makes sense. But everybody is doing it at the same time. I was reading in newspaper that Mitch McConnell briefed the senators that this impeachment procedure may not be very exciting.",
      "reflection": "These verses mark a powerful shift. When Bhishma blows his conch, the entire Kaurava army responds with conches, kettledrums, tabors, and cow-horns—a \"tumultuous\" (tumula) sound. But notice the contrast in verse 14: Krishna (Madhava) and Arjuna, seated in their magnificent chariot yoked with white horses, blow \"divine conches\" (divya shankha). Vyasa doesn't call the Kaurava instruments divine, but he does for the Pandavas. The distinction is significant: their cause was dharmic, driven not by self-interest but by the need to establish righteousness.\n\nObserve also the symbolic depth of the conches. Krishna's Panchajanya was made from the demon Panchajana—representing the five senses now transformed into instruments of divine purpose. Arjuna's Devadatta was a gift from his father Indra. Bhima's Paundra suits his nature as \"Vrikodara\" (wolf-bellied) and \"Bhimakarma\" (doer of terrible deeds). Each conch reflects the essential nature of its owner.\n\nReflect on what your \"conch\" might be—your unique voice, your particular contribution to the world. What would it sound like if you blew it with full conviction? Notice also that the first response to Bhishma's declaration came not from the Pandava commander Dhrishtadyumna, nor from Yudhishthira the king, but from Krishna—the one most committed to establishing dharma. Sometimes the most significant leadership comes not from those with official titles, but from those with the clearest vision of what's right. In your own life, when have you needed to sound your voice first, not because of your position, but because of your clarity of purpose?"

      "commentary": "We are now discussing Chapter 1, Arjuna Vishada Yoga—the Yoga of Arjuna's Grief. In the first 12 verses we have seen so far that Dhritarashtra is very anxious to know what's happening with his sons and Pandu's sons. \"Mamakaha Pandavaschaiva\"—so in the very first verse we see the cause for this war. Dhritarashtra was the guardian after Pandu died for Pandu's sons. When you assign a guardian to take care of children, that guardian is responsible for their welfare and well-being and to protect their interests. That's the job of a guardian. Dhritarashtra, being the Emperor and the uncle of Pandu's sons, was assigned to take care of them.\n\nIt was Dhritarashtra's duty to treat Pandu's children as his own, because he was the guardian. But we clearly see how he had a distinction in his mind between his sons and Pandu's sons. \"Mamakaha Pandavaschaiva\"—that is the cause for this conflict in life. We see that conflict occurs only when someone is not doing his or her duty. Conflicts are there because someone assigned a duty is not doing it, whether it is you or the other. Therefore you also have \"Dharmakshetra Kurukshetra\" here.\n\nThe goal for this war is to establish Dharma again—to re-establish Dharma. Conflict occurs because there is a violation of Dharma somewhere. Who is responsible? One has to figure out.\n\nIn the next 11 verses, we have seen what's happening with three of them. Dhritarashtra was very anxious to know what's going on because he obviously wasn't really sure. Duryodhana, in a similar situation, has his own doubts about the loyalty of his own people and generals. He knew for sure that his cause is not validated by all the great generals in his army; he cannot feel comfortable.\n\nThey are completely loyal to him. Their loyalties may be divided. They are on my side because of their employment, that they are employed by the kingdom but their hearts may be on the other side. It is quite well known that Arjuna was Drona's favorite student. Bheeshma liked Pandavas more than the Kauravas, so he wasn't sure. So the cause of anxiety which we see here is my own failure to follow my own Dharma.\n\nSo all these 12 verses tell us that conflict only occurs when Dharma is violated, and your peace of mind is shattered only when Dharma is violated. When you don't follow your Dharma, your mental peace will be disturbed. We see in Duryodhana that he's suffering from anxiety, and his first target was Drona, because it was quite obvious that Drona has a soft corner for Arjuna and the Pandavas. We have seen his behavior—he enumerates who are on their side and our side, whether our army is enough or not enough. Now we are seeing Bhishma. Bhishma, being the guardian of Hastinapur's throne.\n\nNo matter what the situation, he had the duty to keep the army motivated. He realized that if he leaves this situation any longer, not only is Duryodhana going down, but he's going to bring everybody else down with him—Drona and whoever else he is addressing. So in verse 12, he said \"Tasya Sanjanayan Harsham\"—to cheer them up to fight this battle. \"Simhanadam vinadya ucchaih shankham dadhmau pratapavan.\" He roared like a lion and then blew his own conch.\n\nSo we have discussed last time the declaration of the war. Bheeshma has also come to the conclusion that this conflict can only be settled by this war. Dharma can only be established by just fighting this war. And therefore let's get it done. So he blew his own conch. And now we see the reaction, Quick response from everybody.\n\nAs soon as Bheeshma blew his own conch, everybody else blew their own conches. There was a great sound—everybody playing their kettledrums and cow-horns. Now, there is a reason why armies used to carry those kettledrums. We also know that sound has its own effect. When you go to a disco, the beats, as the yoga teacher will say, will activate your Muladhara chakra—they will make you dance whether you want to or not. As soon as the beat starts, you start dancing.\n\nSo the sound has its own effect in changing your mental makeup. So this great sound will put you into frenzy to do something. So that as soon as the leader has announced that we are ready, everybody else supported and said we are ready too. We have seen the response by the army. Now here interesting thing to note is Bhagavan Vedvyas does not enumerate all the Kauravas generals who blew their conscience. But he does enumerate the Pandavas Tathahas, Swetaihi Hayehi, Yukte Mahati, Syandanesh, Titao, Madhavah, Pandavah, Chayeva, Divya, Sankam, Pradhadvatuhu.\n\nThe very first response comes from Madhav seated in the great chariot yoked by white horses. Pandav Arjun Pandu's son. Pandav here is Arjun Divya, Sankhopra, Dhatma. They believe their own divine conscience. Bhagavan Vedvyas didn't say first. Drishtadhamna did that because he was the chief of the army.\n\nYudhishthir not an Arjun Madhavah. The one person who was really keen in establishing Dharma in Aryavarth was Krishna. He has concluded that this conflict cannot be settled. All the arrogance of Kauravas and their mistreatment to the people will only stop if they are stopped in their tracks. The only way to stop them is to have this war. So the first response actually came from Madhava, Krishna, who had decided he's not going to take up arms himself.\n\nHe said, \"I'm not fighting.\" So sometimes without fighting directly, you can still fight the battle. The lesson to be learned here is you don't have to be always actively making noise. You can very silently win the war. Both Madhava and Pandava Arjuna blew their own divine conches. Bhagavan Vedvyasa seems somewhat biased here. He didn't say the conches on the other side were divine, but he specifically said the Pandava conches were divine.\n\nWhat this means is their cause was divine—to fight this war. Their cause was not driven by their own arrogance or self-interest. Their cause was driven by establishing Dharma. \"Panchajanyam Hrishikesha, Devadattam Dhananjaya, Paundram dadhmau mahasankham Bhima karma Vrikodara.\" Hrishikesha, Lord Krishna, blew his great Panchajanya conch. So the conches were also named probably the sounds were unique from each other. So you can know whose conch is being blown.\n\nIt is more like, you know, I don't see that now, but when we were in Africa. So sitting in your apartment, you know whose car has come just by the noise, you know, the noise the car makes. You know, that must be Harish coming here. Oh, that sounds like Mazda. I think that Neel Kante from the sound of that, you can recognize who is that. So in this great war, you don't know who is where, but with your conch, you can let the other person know where you are.\n\nYour position can be determined by the sound of your conch. That's the way of communication. I think the yodeling in Scandinavia may be a way of communicating. So this conches were for communication. So each one has own signature conch sound. So they know who is where in this formation of this army, how far he is from Panchajanyam.\n\nHrishikesha—Swamiji comments here that Krishna's conch was called Panchajanya because it was made from a demon called Panchajana. There seems to be some philosophical meaning here. The conch which Krishna is blowing was born out of a demon with five attributes—the five senses. Krishna blows his own conch, working through an instrument made up of the five senses. So it's Panchajanya for Krishna. Devadattam for Arjuna—Devadatta.\n\nIndra gave him this conch—it was a gift from his father Indra. Devadattam Dhananjaya. Paundram dadhmau mahasankham Bhima karma Vrikodara. Vrikodara means \"wolf-bellied\"—Bhima. Because he can eat as much as he wants and still digest it like a wolf. \"Bhimakarma\"—a play on his own name, meaning the one who is capable of doing terrible deeds.\n\nHe blew his own great conch named Paundra. \"Anantavijayam raja Kuntiputra Yudhishthira\"—King Yudhishthira, son of Kunti, blew his own conch called Anantavijaya—Eternal Victory. Because he is Dharmaraja, his victory is in establishing truth. And truth has eternal victory.\n\nSo therefore his conch is named Anantavijaya. \"Nakula Sahadeva cha Sughosha Manipushpakau\"—Nakula and Sahadeva also blew their conches, and they reflect their own personalities. Nakula was a fashionable one, therefore his conch is Sughosha—sweet-sounding. Manipushpaka, decorated like a jewel, was Sahadeva's.\n\nOne was a fashion icon, another was an expert with horses. So their conches also reflect their personalities. \"Kashya cha parameshvasa, Shikhandi cha maharatha, Dhrishtadyumna, Virata cha, Satyaki cha aparajita\"—and all the others, such as the King of Kashi who is a great archer, Shikhandi the mighty warrior. Shikhandi was transgender. So you can see that having transgender soldiers is not just a modern military issue.\n\nAnd they had the same issue whether Shikhandi can fight or not. But Pandavas were open minded. Shikhandi never changed his gender. He was born as a girl. And Drupad raised him as a girl. But allowed to fight in the army because they did not discriminate between who can fight in the army whether men or women.\n\nBut Shikhandi, from all accepted description he changed his gender.

So he was raised as a son.\n\nAnd then at some point he left his house because after he got married it created a problem. So he left and then changed his gender. As per the Puranas, he was Amba reborn as Shikhandini. His name was Shikhandini when he was a girl, and then Shikhandi when he became a man. Also listed are Dhrishtadyumna, Drupada's other son, Virata, and Satyaki the unconquered.\n\nSatyaki was actually from Krishna's side. Krishna gave his army to Duryodhana, but not all the generals decided to join that side. Some of them decided they wouldn't take the army but they also wouldn't fight there. Satyaki was one of them.\n\nHe decided to fight from the Pandava side. We know the story of Virata and Dhrishtadyumna. Dhrishtadyumna's only goal in life was to kill Drona to take his father's revenge. So you see, Shikhandi's goal is to kill Bhishma, and Dhrishtadyumna's goal is to kill Drona. So they are mentioned here—just as Drona and Bhishma are on the Kaurava side, the two people who are determined to kill them are on this side.\n\n\"Drupada Draupadeyascha sarvashah prithivipate, Saubhadra cha mahabahu\"—and then all the other people, O King of the earth. Prithivipate here is addressed to Dhritarashtra. Drupada and Draupadi's sons and Saubhadra (Abhimanyu), the mighty-armed—all these great warriors blew their conches. \"Shankhan dadhmuh prithak prithak\"—they blew their own conches separately. Blowing one's own conch is like expressing one's own opinion. Everyone has to have their own opinion.\n\nSo when we are in a meeting somewhere, if you are not having a chance to have your own opinion, that meeting is worthless for you. Everyone has to express their own opinion. Now if everybody is doing it in an orderly manner, it makes sense. But everybody is doing it at the same time. I was reading in newspaper that Mitch McConnell briefed the senators that this impeachment procedure may not be very exciting.",
      "reflection": "These verses beautifully reveal how our instruments—our conches—reflect our inner nature. Yudhishthira, the Dharmaraj, blows \"Anantavijaya\" (eternal victory), because truth's victory is never temporary. Nakula blows \"Sughosha\" (sweet-sounding), reflecting his refined, aesthetic nature. Sahadeva blows \"Manipushpaka\" (jewel-bedecked), fitting his scholarly, detail-oriented character. Even the warriors' instruments express who they are.\n\nNotice also the remarkable inclusion of Shikhandi among the warriors—one who was born female as Amba, raised as male, and eventually changed gender. The Pandava army didn't discriminate about who could fight for dharma; what mattered was commitment to the cause, not conventional categories. This ancient text shows us that the battle for righteousness has always included those who don't fit neatly into society's boxes.\n\nThe verse concludes: \"Shankhaan dadhmuh prithak prithak\"—they blew their conches \"separately,\" each one expressing their individual voice. In any great endeavor, collective action requires individual commitment. Everyone must have their own \"conch to blow,\" their own opinion to voice. Reflect on where you stand in your current \"army.\" Do you have your own voice, your own clear contribution? Or are you merely following along without expressing your authentic commitment? In meetings, in relationships, in life decisions—are you blowing your own conch \"prithak\" (separately, distinctly), or have you lost your individual voice in the collective noise? The Gita suggests that true participation requires both alignment with the larger purpose and the courage to sound your unique note."

      "commentary": "We are now discussing Chapter 1, Arjuna Vishada Yoga—the Yoga of Arjuna's Grief. In the first 18 verses, we have seen the situation with Dhritarashtra, the situation with Duryodhana, how Bhishma reacted, and how the Pandavas reacted. What we are basically seeing here is that anytime someone speaks, we can see his mental state. Unless somebody speaks, we will not know what's going on. So up till now, through the very first verse, we have seen Dhritarashtra's state of mind.\n\nDhritarashtra's state of mind is \"Mamakaha Pandavah\"—his world is divided between mine and others. Even his own brother's children, whom he has raised, he does not consider to be \"mine.\" So we know now that this division in our mind—this duality of \"I and mine\" versus the world outside of me—creates the conflict. All the conflicts, as we have discussed, are there because of this sense of duality and because of not following our own Dharma. Had Dhritarashtra followed his Dharma, we wouldn't have this war.\n\nBhagavan Ved Vyas is now painting the picture of how different people are situated in this Mahabharata. As we have heard many times before, all the characters and situations we encounter in life are already there in the Mahabharata. It is said that if it is not in Mahabharata, it is not worth even knowing or mentioning. The situations we encounter in our life are already depicted somewhere in Mahabharata. So up till now, we have seen that Dhritarashtra said what he wanted to say, and we know that his world is divided into \"mine\" and \"Pandavas.\"\n\nThat's how he saw the world. Then we have seen Sanjaya narrating what's happening on the battlefield. Sanjaya was the most loyal advisor to Dhritarashtra. He would obviously never go against Dhritarashtra or do anything to hurt him. As we know from Mahabharata, even when Dhritarashtra left for the forest after the war, Sanjaya went with him. He was there until they were caught in the forest fire.\n\nI think Dhritarashtra asked him to leave, so he leaves and saves himself. But Dhritarashtra and Gandhari decided they were not going to leave. He was there till the end of his life. But Sanjaya was not a yes-man. As somebody said, if you hire the next guy, don't hire a yes-man—you will be in trouble.\n\nSo Sanjaya was a loyal advisor but not a yes-man. Therefore he gave the narration of what's happening as he saw it. As we have seen, first he describes how Duryodhana acted in that situation. He wasn't fully confident. He was evaluating the strength of each army, whether it's good enough or not good enough. And then we have seen that Bhishma declared the war and the Pandavas responded.\n\nBut the leader of the Pandavas responding was not one of the General but Madhava himself. The Krishna himself responded first. Krishna had already decided there is no other way but to fight this war to settle the score. So Krishna responded and all Pandavas followed enthusiastically. So you can see that the Pandavas are enthusiastic and confident about their own ability and in their cause. It also gives us an indication.\n\nAs long as you are sure about the cause of your pursuits you will be confident. And then we have seen the reaction from Gaurava's side which Sanjay narrates. It's not that we are adding anything here but he never said anything about what happened in the Pandavas side. He only said what's happened on the Dhritarashtra side. And he said this great sound which reverberated between the earth and the sky made the hearts of the people in Dhritarashtra army shiver. He didn't say that for the Pandavas.\n\nThis gives an indication that if you're not sure about your cause, any obstacle will make you unsettled. You will not be sure whether this is the right thing to do or not. On the Pandava side, Sanjaya has not given that indication. He saw only the enthusiastic response to Bhishma's call for the war. So we can take a few lessons from here. As long as you're sure about your pursuits, no matter what obstacles arise, you will be confident and you will pursue your path towards your goal.\n\nIf you're not sure, even the smallest obstacle will make you rethink: Is this the right thing to do? Am I really putting my energy in the right place? Will I be able to win in this situation? Bhagavan Vedavyasa through Sanjaya's narration is painting this picture of how things work. When we are facing this battle of life, after everyone has expressed their opinion by blowing their own conch, each one has to have their own opinion in life. No matter what other people have said. \"Shankhan dadhmuh prithak prithak\"—each one has to say \"I support it\" or \"I don't support it.\"\n\nSo one who is not saying anything, we know that he's on the fence. But each one gave their own opinion that they support this pursuit. On the Pandava side we are seeing enthusiastic support; on the Kaurava side, Sanjaya wants to give the correct report to Dhritarashtra because he is the king. And maybe Bhagavan Vedavyasa had a little bias because he had tried in the beginning to stop this war by convincing Dhritarashtra in a last-ditch effort. But it obviously did not work. So verse 19 says: \"Sa ghosha Dhartarashtranaam hridayani vyadarayat, nabhas cha prithivim chaiva tumulo abhyanunadadayan\"—that tumultuous sound which reverberated between the sky and the earth rent the hearts of Dhritarashtra's army.\n\nVerse 20: \"Atha vyavasthitan drishtva Dhartarashtran Kapidhvaja, pravritte shastra sampate dhanuhu udyamya Pandava.\" Sanjaya now focuses on Arjuna. We have learned from Mahabharata that Sanjaya had this unique vision—not only could he see things, but he could also read people's minds and see things beyond normal perception. In fact, before this war starts, Sanjaya's vision was tested by Bhagavan Vedavyasa and Dhritarashtra. Sanjaya described distant lands which he had never visited before—the people, the culture, and all the fauna and flora of those lands. So he had this great ability to see things which are not within normal perception.\n\nSo now he's focusing on Arjuna, describing what Arjuna is doing and saying. Thus having seen the Kaurava army arranged in formation, Kapidhvaja—Arjuna's chariot was called Kapidhvaja because his emblem on his flag was Hanuman. Hanuman was very devoted to Bhagavan Ramachandra, and he said, \"In any age, at any time, wherever there is Rama, I will be there.\"\n\nKrishna being Rama's incarnation, Hanuman is always there when Krishna is involved in a battle. So Arjuna's chariot is called Kapidhvaja. Thus, having seen the Kaurava army now arranged in formation, with all the weapons ready to be discharged—\"Dhanuhu udyamya\"—he picked up his bow, getting ready. Here Sanjaya addresses Dhritarashtra as \"Mahipate, O Lord of the Earth.\" Having seen all this, Arjuna said this to Hrishikesha, Krishna. \"Arjuna uvacha\"—now Arjuna speaks. Anytime somebody speaks or opens their mouth, we know what's going on in their mind.\n\nThat's why we have this fear of public speaking. Because as long as I keep my mouth shut, you don't know what's going on. Am I a Democrat or Republican or Independent? But as soon as I open my mouth, you know. These days you can also tell what channel someone's watching—MSNBC or Fox News. So up till now, Arjuna has not said anything.\n\nHe just blew his conch. So we know he is very confident, very enthusiastic. I wouldn't call him arrogant—I would call him very confident in his pursuit, in what he is going to do, and in his ability. He picks up his bow—ready, I am ready and capable. And then he said: \"Arjuna uvacha, senayoho ubhayoho madhye ratham sthapaya me Achyuta\"—O Achyuta, place this chariot in the midst of the two armies, right in the middle. He addresses Krishna as \"Achyuta\"—one who never wavers from his position.\n\nSwamiji reminds us here that this is the iconic image we have of Krishna and Arjuna in the chariot. This reminds students of the Upanishads of the parable of the chariot in Katha Upanishad: this body is the chariot and the atma is the rider. Buddhi is the charioteer, the mind is the reins, and the senses are the horses. The sense objects create the path on which the chariot moves. The senses are running on that path, the mind is the reins.\n\nIn the hands of Buddhi, along with the senses, the rider—the ego—becomes the enjoyer. The ego is the rider and the senses are drawing this chariot towards the sense objects. As long as that Buddhi is pure and in control, the chariot will be in control. If the Buddhi is not purified, it will let the senses go in the wrong direction. So here Arjuna tells Krishna to put his chariot right in the middle of the two armies.\n\nBecause \"Yavat etan nirikshey aham yoddhu kaman avasthitan, kairmaya saha yoddhavyam asmin rana samudyame\"—I want to see who are desirous to fight in this battle. I want to make sure that I know whom I am fighting. It's basically due diligence. Anytime we have to go for an interview, the first thing someone might ask is, \"Neil, did you find out who we're competing against?\" I said I never asked that question because half the time they don't give that answer.\n\nBut we are very curious to see who we are competing against. I'm sure Arjuna knew, but he wanted to make sure. Let's see on the very first day who is there. Verse 23: \"Dhartarashtrasya durbuddhe yuddhe priya chikirsava\"—I want to see those who are assembled here to fight, wishing to please in battle the evil-minded son of Dhritarashtra.\n\nWe now see Arjuna's state of mind—very confident, and he has great animosity toward Duryodhana, calling him \"evil-minded son of Dhritarashtra.\" He also knows that the people who are there are not fighting a righteous battle—they just want to please Duryodhana. That's why they are there. Because Duryodhana has the power, he is the person in charge of the entire empire.\n\nAnd they want to be in his good graces, in his good books. Therefore they are there. So let me see who those people are whom I'll be fighting. It's basically as simple as that. That's what we have seen so far.",
      "reflection": "Verse 19 reveals a crucial psychological truth: the tumultuous sound from the Pandava side \"rent the hearts\" (hridayani vyadarayat) of Dhritarashtra's army. When you're uncertain about your cause, even the opponent's confidence becomes threatening. The Kauravas had more soldiers, more resources—yet their hearts were shaken by sound alone. This shows how inner doubt magnifies external challenges.\n\nNotice also the contrasting states of the two sides. Sanjaya reports no heart-rending fear on the Pandava side—only enthusiastic response to the call. As Swamiji teaches, when you're sure about your purpose, obstacles don't destabilize you. When you're not sure, even small setbacks cause doubt. Reflect honestly: in your current challenges, are you more like the confident Pandavas or the anxious Kauravas?\n\nThen comes Arjuna in verse 20-21, described as \"Kapidhvaja\"—one whose flag bears Hanuman. This isn't just decoration; Hanuman promised to be present wherever Rama (and his incarnation Krishna) fights for dharma. Arjuna, supremely confident, picks up his bow and commands: \"Achyuta, place my chariot between the two armies.\" He addresses Krishna as \"Achyuta\"—the one who never wavers. But here's the irony: Arjuna himself is about to waver profoundly. The one who calls on the Unwavering One is about to demonstrate just how much humans can shake. This week, notice when you invoke stability and certainty in others precisely because you sense your own approaching instability. Sometimes our strongest declarations of confidence come just before our deepest crises of doubt."

      ],
      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 1, Arjuna Vishada Yoga—the Yoga of Arjuna's Grief. So far, we have seen that Sanjaya has given us the narration of what's happening—what's happening in the palace, and what's happening at Kurukshetra on the battlefield. He's basically giving us the mental status of each main character in this conflict. We've seen Dhritarashtra first, then Duryodhana, then Arjuna. We have also seen that Arjuna told Krishna to take his chariot and place it in the middle of the two armies. What we have seen so far is that both Arjuna and Duryodhana have strong egos.\n\nOne had negative qualities associated with the ego, the other positive qualities. That's the only difference. Therefore we see Arjuna commanding or giving an order to Krishna: \"Place my chariot in the middle of the two armies.\" How do you know that Arjuna had a big ego? We also see in Mahabharata that Arjuna was the one who objected to competing with Karna. He said, \"Sutaputra—I will not compete with him.\"\n\nWhen they had this competition, that's what Duryodhan gave Karna kingdom of Angadish. So he became Angaraj Because Duryodhan see an opportunity having someone equivalent to Karna Arjuna in his own side. That's how Arkarna became Duryodhana's best friend. Yotsamana avekhse aham. I want to see ya eta itra sama Gataha the people who are gathered here. Dhartra rashtra syedurbuddehe yudde priyachi kir savah.\n\nThose who are gathered here just to please this evil minded Duryodhana. The very words shows his anger, hatred and his own ego. At this point he sees the army on the other side is one homogeneous mass of evil. Because their leader is evil, Duryodhana is evil and all who are gathered on that side are just there to please Duryodhana there is no other motive. Arjuna can see this is the entire army. On the other side is nothing but people with evil intentions.\n\nThey are either themselves an evil or they're just supporting evil for whatever the personal gain or whatever the personal opinion. And now we hear from Sanjay. He gives a very unbiased commentary. He is a commentator just like our news. People claim that all always give is the news. We are not news ourselves.\n\nWe are not putting our coloring. Sanjaya, Vaacha, Evam, Uktva, Hrushikeshah, Guda, Keshena. This is what told by Arjuna to Hrishikesha. Hrishikesha is the one who has the control of the senses. That's one interpretation. Other is the one who has the short hair Gudakesha, one who has the control over sleep on his conquered sleep.\n\nSwamiji says that there is no real proof in Mahabharata in Arjuna's biography that he has conquered sleep. The Western scholars said they won with the hair in bundles. Hair in style bundles. Obviously in India we have not seen that hairstyle. But here we can see the African Americans have hair in bundles. So it's possible that Vedvyas Bhagavan is just saying what they look like and not have this deeper meaning.\n\nWe have a tendency to find deeper meaning in everything we see in our scriptures. In my first year of architecture there were simple tasks like design a handle for a window or a doorknob. And then we obviously made very complicated designs because otherwise how are you going to impress your teacher? So we have a tendency to complicate things and see deeper meaning than what is actually there. It is possible that Bhagavan Vedavyasa simply described how these two people looked. So, having been thus addressed by Arjuna, Krishna responded.\n\nOh, Bharata Bharada here is addressed to Dhritarashtra because he was the king of Bharatkand. It has been said that Kuru dynasty was the first to organize the society in a statewide society. So Bharata, you are the king of this Bharat Khan Senayoho Ubhayoho Madhya Sapayitva Rathautamam. So we have the confirmation from Sanjay that Krishna followed the order thus ordered by Arjuna. Krishna placed the chariot in the middle of the two armies. Bisma Drona, Pramukhataha, Sarve Samcha, Mahikshitam, Vacha Partha Pasheta, Samavetaan, Kurunithi.\n\nHe put it right in front of Bhishma and Drona. He could have put it right in front of Duryodhana instead. And then Krishna spoke the first words uttered by him in Bhagavad Gita. This is the only time we hear Krishna's words indirectly through Sanjaya, otherwise we hear his direct words as \"Sri Bhagavan Uvacha.\" But here Sanjaya reports what Krishna said to Arjuna: \"Pashyaitan—make sure you see all the Kurus who are gathered here.\"\n\nLook at Vishwa and Drona and other kings, but also see all the gurus gathered here. Because what was Arjuna's intention? He just wanted to see who are against him. He wanted to see who are gathered here to please this evil Duryodhana. He very clearly said, that's all I want to see. I want to make sure that I understand who I'm fighting with.\n\nTherefore Krishna put him right in front of the Bhishma Dranada. It's not a homogeneous mass of evil that you're facing—once you wipe out that evil, things won't simply be well and good. There will be problems, there will be side effects. This is how we sometimes think we'll save the world. We believe that if we eradicate the evil from this world, everything will be fine. But we have learned in recent years that eradicating anything doesn't solve the problem unless the root cause is eradicated.\n\nJust eradicating the other side completely will not solve the problem. It may create more problems, but you have to be prepared for that. You should know what you are dealing with. Therefore he put Arjuna's cherry right in the Bhishma and Drona because they are clearly not part of evil. But the more important he said, see all the Kurus who are gathered here. Arjuna himself was a Kuru.\n\nHe was the descendant of the Kuru dynasty. Both Gauravas and Pandavas are descendants of Kurt dynasty. Up till now we have heard Arjuna referring to Kaurava as Dhartrastranam, Dhritarashtra's sons. His animosity was against Dhritarashtra's son, not against Kuru. Therefore, in the previous time when Arjuna has fought with even Bhishma, there was not really big problem. Basically protecting Virat's kingdom and he fought with Bheeshma.\n\nHe didn't have any problem fighting with Bheeshma before. Obviously he didn't try to kill him, but we couldn't kill him anyway. But this time Krishna says, look at all the Kurus. Don't only look at Dhrutrastra's putra. He gives him instruction indirectly. Make sure that you are aware that all your family members are involved on both sides in the next two verses.\n\nTatra apasyat, sthitan, parthah, pitru, Nathaha, pita, Mahan, acharya, matulan, bhrartran, putran, patran, sakimsthata. So now he is obviously observing on both sides that he doesn't see just the evil and good divided by the line. This is what we do in our life. We divide this world of liking and disliking with an imaginary line in my mind that if I can avoid this which I don't like, the world will be nothing. My life will be nothing but pure happiness. Well, we tend to forget that those are intertwined with each other.\n\nThe world which I like and world which I don't like, they intertwined with each other. So some of us in elections are party line voters because we clearly see that this side is a side of good, that side is side of not so good. It's only when you find out that the world is not as clearly divided into good and evil as we like to think. In our childhood we had it's very simple who are bad people, who are good people, cowboys and Indians. But world is not like that. Krishna wants to make sure the Arjuna understands that.\n\nThere is also another implication which we heard from lots of commentators that as we have seen that Arjuna's words indicate he has a big ego. Big ego doesn't mean the person is necessarily bad. Good people have big egos. Artists have big egos, architects have big egos. It's actually said in our profession, unless there are any Gita, it's generally said in our profession that you can't have two architects in the same room. Their egos are so big that no room in this world is large enough to contain two egos of the two architects at the same time.\n\nI learned hard way that when we collaborate with other firms, two architects collaborate with each other and it's a lesson in humility. I was fortunate enough to get this lesson very early on in my career when I came here. So when I was in Dallas, when I first came and working with a very large firm, WZMH somewhat specialized in high rise. And we were collaborating IM Pei, an international architect and he was a design architect. WZMH was just basically an architect of record. So I asked my boss, I said Mark, we are capable to design this project and we had the relationship with the developer, why do we have to bring in Im Pei in the mix?\n\nAnd he said, Neil, 100% of zero is still zero. If you want the whole enchilada, but you're not going to get it. He said you didn't get anything. Is it better to have a portion of an enchilada to devise a situation where at least you have a portion of the pie? So by myself I won't get that project. By themselves, they won't get the project.\n\nWell, let's compromise and say look, we can share this and we have to control our ego. If we share this, then we both get something out of it. So the people with big egos are bipolar in nature. So they go from supreme courage to complete vulnerability in one moment. If they see the world from this side, they will be very courageous. And when they see the competition, they see their own shortcoming.\n\nThey will break down very easily. So Krishna saw that Arjuna is overconfident. He thinks he's the best archer in the world. He has fought Bismar before. He has done all these people. There is nothing which can stop me from wiping out this sea of evil which I see in front of me.\n\nBut he had to be brought to his senses and brought to humility so that he is really prepared to fight this war. So Krishna said, now look at the Bisma, Drona, all other kings and all the crews, all the Kurus include all the people on his side as well. Now Arjuna sees all the people and individually recognize what his relationship with them. Tatra, Apasyat, Parthaha, Pitrunatha, fatherly relatives, Pita Mahan, also grandfatherly relatives, Acharyan, teachers, Mathulan, maternal relatives, Bratan, Putran, Pautran, Sakimstatha. Both sides he says people who are like his sons and also his grandsons, friends, Tatha, Swasuran, Sruhada, Chaeeva, also in laws, the people who are close to you. Now we have confirmation then not only he looked at the Kaurava's army, he also looked at Pandava's army.\n\nHe saw all the people who are dear to him, close to him, related to him. There is no indication he sees evil here. He didn't say oh, I also see Duryodhani. All he saw is the people who are related to him, were closer to him, were dear to him. And therefore he says Krupaya Pariya Vishtaha, Visidantam Idam Abravit. He thus sorrowfully filled with deep pity said this Swamiji says that Sanjay is actually generous in calling him as a deep pity Swamiji actually says that he may be broken down by his own insecurities.\n\nNow he realized that the world is not divided into evil and good, but a mixture of both on all sides. Things which we consider evil and lots of good in it and things we consider good has some evil in it.",
      "reflection": "In verse 23, Arjuna reveals his current mental state: \"I wish to observe those assembled here to fight, wishing to please the evil-minded Duryodhana (durbuddhi).\" Notice the anger and contempt in these words. To Arjuna, the enemy is a \"homogeneous mass of evil\"—Duryodhana is evil, and everyone supporting him is simply trying to \"please\" this evil person. This black-and-white thinking is comfortable but incomplete.\n\nThen Krishna does something profound in verse 24-25. Arjuna asked to see those \"wishing to please Duryodhana.\" But Krishna parks the chariot right in front of Bhishma and Drona—the two men who least fit that description. These aren't sycophants seeking favor; they're noble warriors bound by complex dharmas. And Krishna says: \"Pashya etan—behold all these Kurus gathered here.\" Not \"Dhritarashtra's sons,\" but \"Kurus\"—Arjuna's own clan, including those on his side.\n\nThis is the master therapist at work. Krishna doesn't argue with Arjuna's assessment; he simply expands his field of vision. Reflect on where you might be viewing your challenges through an oversimplified lens. Who are the \"Bhishmas and Dronas\" on the other side of your conflicts—people who aren't simply evil but are caught in their own complex webs of duty and loyalty? When we reduce our opponents to caricatures, we lose the ability to understand the true nature of our situation. What would it mean to truly \"see the Kurus\"—to recognize that those opposing you might share your lineage, your values, even your dilemmas?"

      "reflection": "These verses describe Arjuna's expanded vision. He now sees \"pitrin\" (fathers), \"pitamahan\" (grandfathers), \"acharyan\" (teachers), \"matulan\" (maternal uncles), \"bhratrin\" (brothers), \"putran\" (sons), \"pautran\" (grandsons), \"sakhin\" (friends), \"shvasuran\" (fathers-in-law), and \"suhridah\" (well-wishers)—on BOTH armies. The clear line between \"us\" and \"them\" dissolves. What seemed like a righteous battle against \"evil Duryodhana\" now reveals itself as a civil war within one family.\n\nSwamiji offers a deeper insight here: people with big egos are \"bipolar in nature\"—they swing from supreme confidence to complete vulnerability in one moment. Arjuna, the greatest archer in the world who just commanded Krishna confidently, now sees reality differently and begins to crumble. His previous confidence wasn't based on comprehensive understanding but on a simplified view of the situation.\n\nReflect on moments when your certainty suddenly collapsed upon seeing a situation more completely. Perhaps you were confident about a decision until you truly considered its impact on everyone involved. Perhaps you were sure about a course of action until you recognized the faces on the \"other side.\" This isn't weakness—it's the beginning of wisdom. But the Gita will show that we can't stop here, paralyzed between action and inaction. The question becomes: how do we act with full awareness of complexity, without being paralyzed by it? That's the teaching that will unfold. For now, sit with the discomfort of seeing your own \"battlefield\" more completely. What relationships, what costs, what complications have you been choosing not to see?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 1, Arjuna Vishada Yoga—the Yoga of Arjuna's Grief. We have been seeing various characters involved in this Mahabharata. It reminds me of something I had read in our scriptural literature: \"Yat Pinde Tat Brahmande\"—that which is at the microcosm is at the macrocosm. If I find something in me, I'll be able to find it in the cosmos. The master plan for the microcosm and macrocosm is one and the same.\n\nSo if I find something in macrocosm, I should also be able to find in microcosm, at my individual level, the efficient cause and material cause for the universe. The same efficient cause and material cause for me. Therefore, if I can observe something in the universe, I can also apply that to my own life. Something similar is being said for Mahabharata. As we have discussed before, Mahabharata contains all human situations and characters. So if I find a character in Mahabharata, and if I introspect very carefully, I'll find that character in me too, in my own personality.\n\nLet me find Dhritarashtra in me—blinded by attachment to his children, he cannot see what is right and wrong when it comes to them. I can also probably find Duryodhana in me. Duryodhana wanted to keep something which came accidentally to him, and he doesn't want to give it up. Many internet millionaires in the late '90s and early 2000s went through exactly this. I actually know one person in particular who made millions in technology, and once he got out of that, he made all his efforts to retain it and failed miserably.\n\nThat's Duryodhana in us. Something came to us accidentally, but we don't want to give it up. We also find Bhishma in us—someone who rigidly follows the rules but ignores the principles. When it comes to paying taxes, we are more like Bhishma. If I can find that I meet the IRS criteria for not paying any taxes, even though I am a multi-billion dollar corporation, that's perfectly legal. But I completely forget the principle of paying taxes.\n\nIt's for the social welfare. If I don't pay anything, I'm not contributing anything to the social welfare. So I may find Bhishma in me who is rigidly following the rules but forgetting the principles. I may find Arjuna in me who is very keen on overcoming the obstacles which are in his path of his happiness, what we think is rightfully his. He wants to get over those obstacles. In this case, Duryodhana.\n\nDuryodhana is in his path of finding that happiness, of getting that kingdom back. We have all enthusiasm to march forward towards our success. And if there is anything in our way, going to get rid of it. But we hope that we also find Krishna in us who says, well, look at it comprehensively. So Krishna said, look at all these people. All the Kurus are gathered here not only on the other side, but also on your side.\n\nThe Kurus on your side too. Look at them basically reminding, look at the situation, what you're trying to achieve. How many people have to make what kind of sacrifices for you to achieve your own goal? In our enthusiasm to achieve success and move forward in our life, we completely forget how many people are making sacrifices for us on our own side. From our family, from your friends, from your relative. Lots of people have to do a lot of things so that I can move forward in my life.\n\nThat is one point we forget to acknowledge. We never say thank you to people who supported us, who brought me to this level. But we also, I am a self made man. I came here with $8 in my pocket. I'm not sure that the young generation understands. My generation understands.\n\nIndia used to have restriction that only you can take $8 in foreign exchange when you leave India. So people very proudly say, I came with $8 and look at what I accomplished. We forget to acknowledge what my parents did to get to the point where I can take the $8 and come here. So Krishna reminds us that look at on all sides. Make sure that you understand that lots of people have to make lots of sacrifices for you to come to a point where you are capable of overcoming the obstacles which you perceive as the obstacles in the path of happiness. The message we get here is not only that we should introspect negative in us, but also we should introspect and find that Krishna's voice in us.\n\nThen see what is the guidance here. Arjuna now sees the situation in its totality. He looks at how many people are gathered Here and the impact on him is what we are now seeing from Sanjay's description. So Sanjaya says, Krupaya Paraya Vistaha Visidhan Idham Abhravit. Overwhelmed by great compassion or pity, he sorrowfully said this. So Sanjaya says by observing who are gathered on both sides that Arjuna came over with immense pity or compassion.\n\nBut he's sorrowful that I'm not going to achieve the goal I came here to achieve. I came here to eliminate the evil of Duryodhana, then establish the kingdom which is rightfully ours. So he is now conflicted about whether it is good for him to continue or it will be very noble of him to walk away from the situation. We see this situation many times. The student is very bright and he wants to go to Harvard. Then he realizes family has to make the sacrifice the family cannot afford.\n\nCome from a poor family. They say it will be okay, I'll go to community college. Out of the compassion for his family members. So Bhagavan says, well look at is this the situation here? So we hear from Arjuna. I say Dristwa Imam Swajanam K Krishna Yuyutsum Sam Upasthitam by seeing all the dear ones gathered here and eager to fight.\n\n\"Sidanti mama gatrani\"—my limbs are failing me. I am the mightiest warrior but I don't have any strength. \"Mukham cha parishushyati\"—my mouth is drying up, my body is shivering. I'm having goosebumps. I'm overwhelmed by fear, very fearful. You get goosebumps when you're either fearful or too excited.\n\nSo in this verse he describes his physical condition. Medical professionals will say this is a nervous breakdown situation. So Arjuna basically had the symptoms of a nervous breakdown. The next verse says \"Gandhivam sramsate hastat tvak chaiva paridahyate, na cha shaknomi avasthatum bhramativa cha me manaha\"—I can't even hold my bow Gandiva, which I rely on, which I have mastered. But right now, given my physical condition, I'm not capable. My body is failing me.\n\nThe Gandiva is slipping from my hand and my skin is burning. I am also unable to stand. \"Na cha shaknomi avasthatum\"—I can't even stand. I need to sit down, I need to lie down. \"Bhramativa cha me manaha\"—my mind is whirling. So he is describing his mental condition as well.\n\nI'm having this physical sickness. I am losing strength but I am also having an anxiety attack. So basically he is having a nervous breakdown, an anxiety attack. And what happens when you cannot control that situation? The next verse says \"Nimittani cha pashyami viparitani Keshava\"—I now see things strangely. On one hand,\n\nI can't even think straight, what's going on? I can't even stand. But now I can see clearly—\"Nimittani\"—omens. \"I can clearly see viparitani Keshava\"—adverse omens, that something bad is going to happen. This is delusion. When we start having superstitions—oh, because I woke up on this side of the bed, then this will happen—these are things which I know intellectually are not possible.\n\nA black cat crossing my path cannot have any effect on what I'm going to do when I get to my office. But my mind says otherwise. That is because I'm not listening to my buddhi, my intellect, as Swamiji says. Instead, I'm listening to something I heard before, some superstition, and I'm believing in it. So now Arjuna is clearly exhibiting the signs of delusion. \"Nimittani cha pashyami viparitani Keshava, na cha shreyo anupashyami hatva svajanam ahave\"—I do not see any good coming out of killing my own people in battle.\n\nSo he has gone from I can't comprehend this situation which I'm facing, therefore I'm losing the strength. I'm having this physical symptoms of nervous breakdown. I'm having anxiety attack. How I'm going to handle this thing. Now I come to the conclusion that this is probably not the right thing to do. So now I'm creating my own reality and then believing it.\n\nMore I stay in that condition, more I believe in it. Swamiji says the intellect which is normally guiding you is not available to you, but you create an alternate reality. And now I have all the good reason to believe in the realities. So I'm now believing in that alternate universe which I'm living in. And then I have all the justification. So the justification, my mind is creating the justifications, not intellect.\n\nSo intellect has basically resigned from guiding you. Mind takes over and says I have all the answers. Let me tell you what is happening here in that state of that anxiety and delusion. A dream like situation. In dream we create our own reality. That reality at that time is very real to me.\n\nSomebody who's dreaming, you try to convince him you're dreaming. Obviously he will not listen to you as long as he's in dream. Only if he wakes up from that dream, he will listen to you this delusion is something similar to that. That reality is so real for that person that he is not willing to accept the other reality which other people see as the real. Therefore, when you have any kind of a mental disorder, you go to some professional psychiatrist. Because if you talk to your relatives or friends, you will not listen to them say, no, no, I know, but maybe you listen to somebody who you think is third party, who has no X to grind in your life, and you tell him.\n\nThen in the end he says, okay, that's fine, our session is over. The charges are $350 an hour. He said, you suddenly come out of your depression. How many hours can I spend here? But that's obviously because you are someone who is not invested in your situation. And you're seeing from his perspective.\n\nAnd that person tells you Krishna obviously is that person. Krishna is the psychiatrist here. The good news is Arjuna has faith in Krishna. First his argument going forward why he should not be in this situation. Now, how this situation came upon him is obviously up to our imagination, but we have seen the description of what's happening. If this is an effect, that this is what happened to Arjuna, there is a cause for it.\n\nSo the cause can be only one of the two causes. Sanjaya said he was overwhelmed by the pity and compassion that I can be the cause for destruction of all my relatives. So that may be one cause. Maybe he felt that compassion that how can I be the cause for my people and all the people on the other side to be killed? Swamiji says there is another reason this can happen. He realized the task at hand is not as simple as he thought, because he never imagined a situation other than him winning.\n\nAll I have to do is get rid of Duryodhana, win this war and the kingdom will be rightfully mine. He never thought about what support Duryodhana will have. Duryodhana support from Bheeshma, Drona, Kurupacharya, all those great warriors who are as good or better than him.",
      "reflection": "These verses describe the classic symptoms of what we might today call a panic attack or nervous breakdown. Arjuna reports: \"Sidanti mama gatrani\" (my limbs are failing), \"mukham cha parishushyati\" (my mouth is parched), \"vepathush cha sharire\" (my body trembles), \"romaharshas cha jayate\" (my hair stands on end). His Gandiva—the legendary bow he has mastered—slips from his hand. His skin burns. He cannot stand. His mind reels (\"bhramativa cha me manah\").\n\nNotice that these verses move from physical symptoms (verse 29) to functional collapse (verse 30). The greatest warrior in the world, who just moments ago commanded Krishna with confidence, now cannot even hold his weapon. This is the psychosomatic reality of overwhelming emotion—when the mind is shattered, the body follows.\n\nThe Gita begins with this honest portrayal because transformation requires acknowledging where we actually are, not where we wish we were. Arjuna doesn't hide his breakdown; he describes it in detail. Swamiji reminds us that within each person are all the characters of Mahabharata—we have our Dhritarashtra (willful blindness), our Duryodhana (grasping attachment), our Bhishma (rigid adherence to rules over principles), and yes, our Arjuna (paralysis when facing difficult truths). Reflect this week on moments when you've experienced your own version of these symptoms—the physical manifestations of being overwhelmed. Rather than judging these reactions, recognize them as the starting point for deeper wisdom. What situations cause your \"Gandiva to slip\"? What truths make your mind reel? The Gita's message begins here: the admission of our vulnerability is the doorway to receiving teaching."

      "reflection": "In verse 31, Arjuna says: \"Nimittani cha pashyami viparitani\"—I see adverse omens, portents of disaster. This is the mark of a mind slipping into delusion. When we're overwhelmed, we begin to see signs and superstitions where there is only cause and effect. The black cat crossing our path cannot affect our business meeting, yet in states of anxiety, the rational mind abdicates and magical thinking takes over.\n\nNotice Arjuna's reasoning in verses 32-33: \"I desire not victory, nor kingdom, nor pleasures. Those for whose sake we desire these things—they stand here ready to sacrifice their lives and wealth.\" This sounds noble, even wise. But Swamiji points out a critical insight: when the intellect (buddhi) abandons its guiding role, the mind creates an \"alternate reality\" that feels completely valid. Arjuna has constructed a seemingly logical argument, but it's built on the foundation of emotional overwhelm, not clear seeing.\n\nReflect on times when you've created elaborate justifications for avoidance. \"I'm not taking that opportunity because it would mean sacrificing family time\"—when really, fear of failure was driving the decision. \"I'm staying in this situation out of loyalty\"—when actually, fear of change kept you stuck. The Gita teaches us to examine not just the content of our reasoning but its source. Is your decision emerging from clear-headed assessment or from emotional chaos that has dressed itself in logical clothing? This week, when you find yourself constructing arguments against action, pause and ask: Is my buddhi guiding me, or has my mind hijacked the process and started manufacturing convenient truths?"

        "By killing these sons of Dhritarashtra, what pleasure can\nbe ours, O Janardana? Only sin will accrue to us from killing these felons."
      ],
      "commentary": "Dhritarashtra asked the question: What's happening in Dharmakshetra Kurukshetra, and what are my sons and Pandavas doing? From Duryodhana's perspective, he was insecure. Even though he had the largest army, he could not take winning for granted. Then we saw Arjuna's request to Krishna to put the chariot in the middle of the army. And once Krishna did that, Krishna simply said: Look at Bheeshma, Drona, all the Kauravas gathered here, ready to fight.\n\nMost of the time, we focus on what we are trying to achieve in life. And then when we achieve it, we take all the credit ourselves. We tend to forget that lots of people have to make lots of sacrifices for us to get to that point. Basically, Krishna's message to Arjuna is: Look at how many people are here to support your cause. Make sure you acknowledge that—it's not you alone who will be capable of winning this war. Arjuna always thought he could win this war.\n\nHe has won it before. You know, he went to fight with Drupada for Drona and earned half his kingdom for Drona. He fought with Gandharvas when they captured Duryodhana. And he also fought Kaurava's army when they attacked Virata's kingdom. And he has won all the time. He has not learned yet what failure is in his life.\n\nSo he had his own opinion about what his capabilities are and what he can do. But when he sees both sides, he sees the enormity of the task. That is not as simple as just winning the battle against enemies. Now you are fighting among your own people, in the people who are as capable of himself, Bheeshma and Drona and all other people, Karna and. And he sees that on his side also all his family members are there to help him. That creates confusion in his mind.\n\nSo we have seen last few verses that he first had this nervous breakdown. What am I doing here? Is this the right thing to do? Is it really worth fighting this war. And finally he has the delusion about what the situation is all about. So then he obviously starts describing what he's feeling.\n\nSo first he said, I can't even stand my body shivering. I can't even hold my Gandiva. The Gandiva is slipping away from my hand. All the physical symptoms of person who is having nervous breakdown. But now he's describing what he thinks the reality is a delusion. Person sees reality as if he's seeing in a dream, an alternate reality.\n\nOther people see reality one way but the person is under delusion. He sees reality differently. He starts describing his reality very differently. The first thing he says, Nimitta ni che pasyami vi paritha ni keshava nacha shreyo anupashyami hatva sajanam ahave. Nothing good is going to come out of this war. I now see that something wrong is happening here.\n\nSo we can see now he is having a superstition. My left eye is fluttering. So that's not good, right? I had a surgery on Thursday. We were getting ready and Meena was boiling milk. Now obviously you know what we consider bad omen?\n\nSo Mina was very careful. She was standing right in front of the milk and I didn't even know any of that. But I'm just sitting there. And then for one second she turned around to, to wash a cup or something and the milk spilled and she literally screamed, you know, I don't. I said, what happened? I thought that something really bad had really happened.\n\nSo I got up from the chair and said, what's happened? That's just the milk. I thought, oh, that's okay. I didn't want this to happen. So I realized inside what's bothering her because we were already double minded going for a surgery because my vision was relatively okay. But doctor said your lens has come loose and it can fall anytime.\n\nSo it's good to get it done. I say you can do it whenever you feel like, but it's not going anywhere. But still, like your camera lens is loose. We decided, well, let's get it over with. And I realized what is bothering her, that we are going for surgery and he's a bad omen. So I didn't say a word because I knew what she was bothering her.\n\nBut I didn't discuss that because I knew if I discuss that, it will go even further back if I try to say, don't worry, I don't believe in that. Let's even make it worse. I have not Discussed that with her. But I could see clearly what she was worried about. So whenever mind is not seeing the reality clear, then it's a simple milk boiling over. It works as described in physics books.\n\nBut we don't see it that way. It's not the laws of physics now we are worried about. We're worried about some metaphysical rules of how things work in this world. So Arjuna now is not seeing reality as is. He said, I'm not seeing. I think logically I come to this country simply.\n\nI just see bad omens. So that's the sign of a delusion. And then he says, Nakank se Vijayam Krishna Nacharajyam Sukha nicha kim no Rajya na Govinda kim bhogi jeevte Nava. I desire no victory, O Krishna. I don't own the kingdom Na Sukhani. I don't any comforts.\n\nWhat is the purpose of having all this domain to us? Govinda Isham arthe kanksitam nah Rajyam Bhogaha Sukha nicha ta IME Avasthita Yudhte pranam tyaktva Dhananicha. For whom we desire this kingdom and comforts for our own people. Every parent says that we have done this for our children. Nobody said I did it for myself. This is for whom we desire this kingdom and this comfort and all the prosperity.\n\nThey are standing here to fight this war. Acharyaha, Pitaraha, Putraha, Tatha, Ivach, Pita Mah. My teachers, my fatherly relatives. Matulaha, Swasuraha, Pautraha, Shyalaha, Samandinisthada. My sons, grandfathers, maternal relatives, Swasuraha in laws, Potraha. My grandchildren, Sialaha in laws again, Sabandin and all other relatives.\n\nEtan ichami Gnatoapi Madhusudana. I do not desire to kill them. Even if I get killed, Even if I get the domain over all three worlds. Some of Puranas describe three worlds. Swargalok, Mrityulok and Patal Lok Mrityulog. Because we are all mortals, things are impermanent.\n\nIn Mrityulog, Swargalok, everything is always pristine and serene. Patalok is beyond our world. More like past, present and future. So even if I have the domain of all three worlds, it's not worth it to kill my own people. Then what is the point in fighting for a little piece of Land, this little kingdom on this earth, in this mortal world. So he made his statement very clear.\n\nNow, if these words were his own, after reflection on the situation over a period of time and very intense contemplation, whether this is right or that's right, then he comes to this conclusion. These are very noble words for whom we are desiring all this. If these people are not going to benefit, or these people have to make sacrifice, it's not worth it. But we know that he did not do that before, because just before Bheeshma Parva, there's Udayoga Parva. Bheesma Parva starts when the war starts. The efforts both sides made to avoid this war.\n\nDrupada sends his Brahmin diplomat to go and negotiate it out. Look, this war is not worth. So Drupada's emissary goes to Dhritarashtra's court and makes the argument why it is best for everybody to divide this kingdom into half as it was before, give Pandavas theirs. This enough for both of you to enjoy these kingdoms. Dhritarashtra was pretty much convinced that that's the right thing to do. Bhishma had given his advice that to avoid this war, this is the only way.\n\nKarna interrupted Bhma and said no. Yudhishthira lost his kingdom in this game of dice. Now if he wants this kingdom back, he has to beg. There is no settlement. And Visma actually told Karna that if you don't listen to what the guy just say and don't agree to it, you'll end up in a war. And that's not going to be any good for anybody.\n\nSo there are two characters here who are against settlement, Duryodhana and Karna. Karna had his own agenda. He had no interest in who wins this war. You know, his agenda was he wanted to prove he's better than Arjuna. If this war does not occur, Karna had no chance to prove that he is better than Arjuna. So he has his own agenda.\n\nSo then I can prove myself that Arjuna is not the best archer in the world. I am the best archer in the world. Then Dhritarashtra sends Sanjaya to Yudhishthira to have his side of proposal for settlement. And that proposal was very simple. War is not good for anybody. Exactly the words which you are hearing from Arjuna.\n\nSo Sanjaya made his case. I'm here on behalf of King Dhritarashtra. King is reminding you that my children are spoiled. They are not listening to me. What they are doing is not right. However, you people are good people.\n\nYou should know what is right and wrong. It's like two children fighting in a family. You also don't understand being an older one. Exact same message to the Yudhishthira that you are. Dharmaraj, how can you engage in this Adharma of fighting a war against your own cousins? Arjun at the time said give Duryodhan a message that Keshav and I will kill you, the evil Dury and all evil cousins.\n\nEven Indra's army cannot defeat when Krishna and I are together. And he said my Gandiva is twitching, arrows are peeping out of cleaver. So he basically said I'm so anxious. But Dhritarashtra plants the seeds that the war is never good. The result of any war is nothing but hell whether you win the war or lose the war. So the ideas presented were logical.\n\nWhen you look at it from a very narrow perspective. So here the words which are hearing from Arjuna are literally borrowed from Sanjaya's message, then there is no good coming out of it. Swamiji points out here that this is a case of a rift between your Buddhi and your mind. Buddhi is your subjective mind. This buddhi is available when I'm thinking very rationally and seeking Buddhist guidance. He's already demonstrated that he lost all control over his mind.\n\nSo this subjective mind, which is buddhi, an objective mind, objective mind is simply receiving information from outside and trying to interpret. But it does not have much experience. So it has to rely on a Buddha to decide whether this situation is what it is all about and how to react to the situation. So here Arjuna is now one side. He is torn between his desire to win over Duryodhana, set the record straight and get what is rightful his because he's capable of doing so. The other side, he now remembers that everything Sanjaya said is true.\n\nThey're all standing right in front of me and I have to fight them and I have to kill them. They may get killed, my people may get killed. But in the end the winning or losing may not mean anything because we have lost our own people. So right now what we are seeing is confusion created by Dhritarashtra. Like the argument we hear recently in our impeachment. Some Republican senators or congressmen said whatever Trump did is not right, but it is not worth impeaching.\n\nWe should be sorting this out internally. Dhritarasa sent the same message through Sanjaya. Whatever Duryodhana is doing is not right. But if you people are wise enough.",
      "reflection": "In verse 34, Arjuna catalogs his relationships across the battlefield: \"Acharyas (teachers), pitarah (fathers), putras (sons), pitamahas (grandfathers), matulas (maternal uncles), shvashuras (fathers-in-law), pautras (grandsons), shyalas (brothers-in-law), sambandhinas (relatives).\" This exhaustive list reveals that Arjuna is now drowning in a sea of relationships, unable to see anything else—not the thirteen years of exile, not Draupadi's humiliation, not the multiple assassination attempts by the Kauravas.\n\nVerse 35 contains a revealing phrase: \"Api trailokya rajyasya hetoh\"—even for the sovereignty of the three worlds, I would not kill them. Then he adds: \"Kim nu mahikrite\"—let alone for this earthly kingdom. Notice how he escalates to cosmic proportions. This is the mind in distress, constructing ever-grander justifications.\n\nBut verse 36 reveals the deepest confusion: \"Nihatya dhartarashtran nah ka pritih syat\"—what pleasure can we have by killing Dhritarashtra's sons? And then: \"Papam eva ashrayed asman hatva etan atatayinah\"—sin alone would accrue even though they are felons (atatayinah). Arjuna acknowledges that his enemies ARE felons deserving punishment under dharma-shastra, yet concludes that punishing them would still be sinful. This is the rift between buddhi and manas—knowing what's right yet feeling pulled toward inaction. Reflect on situations where you've acknowledged someone's wrongdoing yet felt paralyzed about addressing it. \"Yes, they violated my trust, but they're family.\" \"Yes, this is harmful, but taking action seems worse.\" The Gita will teach us to see through such confusion, but first we must recognize it within ourselves."

      "commentary": "These three verses capture one of the most psychologically acute moments in the entire Gita. Arjuna has moved from describing the horror of what he's about to do to making what seems like a perfectly reasonable moral argument. And this is where things get interesting.\n\nLook at the progression of his thinking: In verse 37, he appeals to Krishna as \"Madhava\"—a name that emphasizes Krishna's divine nature. He's essentially saying, \"You're the Supreme Lord. Surely you understand that killing one's own people cannot lead to happiness.\" It's a clever move. He's not just expressing despair anymore; he's constructing an argument.\n\nAnd then comes verse 38, where Arjuna reveals something fascinating about how he sees his opponents. He says that *they*—Duryodhana and his party—are blinded by greed. Their minds are clouded. They cannot see the sin they're committing by destroying families and betraying friends. In other words, they have an excuse: ignorance.\n\nBut verse 39 delivers the real punch. Arjuna says: We can see clearly. We understand exactly what's wrong with this situation. And precisely because we see clearly, we have a greater responsibility to turn away from this sin.\n\nThis is where Arjuna's argument becomes both compelling and problematic.\n\nOn the surface, it makes perfect sense. If I know something is wrong and do it anyway, am I not more culpable than someone who acts from ignorance? Isn't knowledge supposed to guide action? Isn't the wise person supposed to refrain from harmful acts?\n\nYes—and yet.\n\nSwami Chinmayananda would often point out that Arjuna is using valid spiritual principles to arrive at an invalid conclusion. This is one of the mind's most sophisticated tricks: using dharma to justify adharma, using wisdom to rationalize avoidance, using compassion as a mask for fear.\n\nThe key word in verse 38 is *lobha*—greed. Arjuna accuses his enemies of being driven by greed. But wait. What is driving Arjuna right now? Is it pure moral clarity? Or is it something else wearing the clothes of moral clarity?\n\nConsider: Arjuna doesn't want to lose his loved ones. He doesn't want to bear the psychological burden of having killed his grandfather, his teacher, his cousins. He doesn't want to live with that memory. These are understandable human desires. But they are, in their own way, also forms of attachment—of wanting things to be a certain way, of grasping at a particular outcome.\n\nThe Gita will spend the next seventeen chapters addressing exactly this confusion. For now, we simply need to notice it.\n\nThere's another layer to explore here. Arjuna says he can \"clearly see\" the evil of destroying families. But seeing clearly is precisely what he's not doing.\n\nHere's what Arjuna is not seeing: He's not seeing that this war has been coming for decades. He's not seeing that every peaceful option was exhausted. He's not seeing that Duryodhana rejected every compromise, every appeal to justice, every opportunity for reconciliation. He's not seeing that sometimes standing up to adharma requires actions that are painful.\n\nMost importantly, he's not seeing himself clearly. He thinks he's being noble. He thinks refusing to fight is the ethical choice. But mixed into his reasoning are threads of fear, attachment, and confusion that he can't distinguish from his genuine moral concerns.\n\nThis is the human condition. We rarely have pure motives. Our noblest intentions are intertwined with our fears and desires. The person who refuses to have a difficult conversation \"to keep the peace\" may genuinely care about peace—and may also be afraid of conflict. The person who \"doesn't want to hurt anyone\" may be compassionate—and may also be avoiding the discomfort of standing firm.\n\nArjuna is not a villain. He's not being dishonest. He is genuinely confused. And that's the point. The Gita takes seriously the fact that confusion can feel like clarity, that attachment can dress itself up as wisdom.\n\nThere's a beautiful irony in verse 39 that often goes unnoticed. Arjuna asks: \"Why should we not learn to turn away from this sin?\"\n\nLearn. He uses the word *jñeya*—that which should be known, that which should be learned.\n\nBut learning is exactly what's about to happen. Krishna is going to teach him. The next seventeen chapters are Arjuna's education. And what will he learn? Not that killing is good. Not that compassion doesn't matter. But that his understanding of the situation is incomplete, that his identification of what constitutes sin and virtue is confused, that his notion of who he is and what he's doing needs to be fundamentally revised.\n\nThe great teaching is coming. But it can only come because Arjuna asked for it—even though he didn't know he was asking. His anguish, his paralysis, his philosophical objections—all of these created the opening through which wisdom could enter.\n\nIn verse 7 of Chapter 2, Arjuna will formally ask Krishna to teach him. But in a sense, the request is already implicit here. A mind that is questioning, struggling, refusing to act from blind obedience—this is a mind that is ready to learn.\n\nLet's also notice how Arjuna addresses Krishna in these verses. In verse 37, he says \"Madhava\"—emphasizing Krishna's divine descent through the Madhu lineage. In verse 39, he says \"Janardana\"—a name meaning \"one who causes people to tremble\" or more positively \"one who answers the prayers of people.\"\n\nThese names reveal something about Arjuna's state. He's appealing to Krishna's divinity, his power, his role as the one who responds to devotees' prayers. On some level, Arjuna knows that what he needs right now is not just practical advice but divine guidance. He may think he wants Krishna to validate his choice not to fight. But deeper down, he's calling out to the divine for rescue from his own confusion.\n\nEvery sincere prayer is like this. We think we know what we want. We think we're asking for something specific. But underneath the specific request is a more fundamental cry: Help me. Show me. I am lost.\n\nThese verses also touch on one of life's most difficult truths: the fact that others' wrongdoing does not excuse us from our own responsibilities.\n\nArjuna says, in effect: \"They are blinded by greed. They don't see clearly. Therefore they can be excused for their actions. But we see clearly—so we should act accordingly.\"\n\nThe logic seems impeccable. But here's the problem: In a world where everyone excused themselves from difficult action by pointing to others' moral failures, nothing would ever get done. Evil would flourish unchecked, protected by the scruples of good people who didn't want to dirty their hands.\n\nThis is one of the oldest moral debates in human history. How do we respond to wrongdoing? Is it better to remain pure and let evil triumph? Or to engage with the messy, morally ambiguous work of opposing it?\n\nThe Gita's answer will be nuanced. It won't simply say \"fight\" or \"don't fight.\" It will reframe the entire question by introducing the concept of *nishkama karma*—action without attachment to results. It will distinguish between the action itself and the ego that claims ownership of the action. It will show that the real sin is not in acting but in acting from a place of ego, attachment, and delusion.\n\nBut we're not there yet. Right now, we're sitting with Arjuna in his confusion. And perhaps that's where we need to start—acknowledging our own confusion, our own mixed motives, our own sophisticated rationalizations. Before we can receive the teaching, we have to feel the weight of not knowing.\n\nThere's something else worth exploring in these verses—the concept of *sukha*, happiness. In verse 37, Arjuna asks: \"How can we be happy by killing our own people?\"\n\nIt's a reasonable question. And it points to something fundamental about how most of us think about ethics and action. We tend to evaluate our choices based on whether they will make us happy or unhappy. Will this bring me peace? Will I be able to live with myself?\n\nBut the Gita is going to challenge this entire framework. Krishna will eventually teach that true happiness—*ananda*—doesn't depend on external circumstances at all. It doesn't come from the results of our actions, whether pleasant or painful. It comes from something deeper, something that remains constant regardless of what happens in the world.\n\nArjuna is worried about his future mental state. He's trying to protect his peace of mind. And from one perspective, this seems wise. But from another perspective, it reveals the problem: he's making his decision based on attachment to a particular inner state rather than based on what the situation actually requires.\n\nThis is subtle, and it's worth sitting with. We often pride ourselves on being conscientious people who care about the consequences of our actions. But sometimes that very conscientiousness becomes another form of self-centeredness—we're so focused on how we'll feel afterward that we can't see clearly what needs to be done now.\n\nThe word *kula* appears repeatedly in these verses—it means family, lineage, or clan. Arjuna speaks of *kulakshaya*, the destruction of families. This was a profound concern in the ancient world, where family lineage carried tremendous weight, where ancestral traditions were passed down through generations, where the continuity of the clan was seen as sacred.\n\nBut here's the thing: the Kauravas had already destroyed the family. Duryodhana's greed, his jealousy, his repeated attempts to murder his cousins, his public humiliation of Draupadi—all of this had already torn the fabric of the family apart. The war wasn't destroying something intact; it was the final consequence of decades of destruction that had already occurred.\n\nArjuna speaks as if he has a choice between preserving the family and destroying it. But that choice was made long ago, by others. What Arjuna actually faces is a different choice: whether to stand up for dharma in the aftermath of destruction, or to let adharma triumph unchallenged.\n\nThis distinction matters in our own lives too. We sometimes imagine that by withdrawing from conflict, we're preserving peace. But often, by the time we face a difficult choice, the damage has already been done by others. Our choice isn't between peace and conflict; it's between facing reality and pretending it doesn't exist.\n\nOne final observation about these verses. Notice that Arjuna is still talking. He's been making arguments for verses now—philosophical, emotional, moral arguments. He's been eloquent. He's been passionate. He's made some excellent points.\n\nBut he hasn't asked Krishna for guidance yet. Not really. He's presenting his case, building his argument, trying to convince Krishna that he's right. He's still operating from the assumption that he understands the situation and just needs validation.\n\nThe real breakthrough will come in Chapter 2, when Arjuna finally admits: \"I don't know what's right. I'm confused. Please teach me.\" Until he reaches that point of genuine not-knowing, no teaching can enter.\n\nThis is true for all of us. As long as we're sure we're right, as long as we're building our case and making our arguments, we're not actually open to learning anything new. Wisdom requires a particular kind of humility—the willingness to admit that our current understanding might be incomplete or mistaken.\n\nArjuna isn't there yet. But he's getting closer. Each verse brings him nearer to the point of surrender. And that's the arc of Chapter 1: the gradual dissolution of certainty, the slow crumbling of confidence, until finally there's enough openness for something new to emerge.",
      "reflection": "In verse 37, Arjuna delivers what seems like a moral conclusion: \"Tasmat na arha vayam hantum\"—THEREFORE we should not kill Dhritarashtra's sons, our relatives. Notice the word \"tasmat\"—therefore. He's concluded his argument. But verse 38 reveals the subtle trick his mind is playing: \"Yadyapi ete na pashyanti lobhopahatachetasah\"—though THEY, with minds overpowered by greed (lobha), do not see the evil in destroying families. In other words: they have an excuse—they're blinded by greed. But we see clearly!\n\nVerse 39 completes the trap: \"Katham na jneyam asmabhih papad asman nivartitum\"—why should WE not know to turn away from this sin, we who clearly see the evil? This is one of the mind's most sophisticated tricks: using dharma to justify adharma, using wisdom to rationalize avoidance. \"They're ignorant; we're wise; therefore, we should act differently.\" It sounds noble. But examine it closely.\n\nSwamiji teaches that Arjuna is using valid spiritual principles to reach an invalid conclusion. Yes, knowledge brings greater responsibility. Yes, we should not act from greed. But Arjuna's \"clarity\" is itself a form of not-seeing. He's not seeing the thirteen years of injustice. He's not seeing that every peaceful option was exhausted. He's not seeing that sometimes opposing adharma requires difficult action. Reflect on where you've elevated yourself morally to justify inaction: \"I won't stoop to their level,\" \"I'm above this conflict,\" \"Someone of my values doesn't engage in such things.\" Sometimes these are genuine wisdom. Sometimes they're fear dressed in spiritual clothing. The Gita will teach us to tell the difference—but first, we must be honest enough to question our own \"clarity.\""

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 1, Arjuna Vishada Yoga—the Yoga of Arjuna's Grief. So far in Chapter 1, we have seen that Arjuna was very confident before the declaration of war and was anxious to get started. But when he decided to look at the situation in its entirety, he started melting down. We have seen Arjuna's meltdown—overwhelmed by the sheer enormity of the task and its consequences. We work all of our life to achieve something, and then comes a defining moment.\n\nThat defining moment—how we behave—will determine the outcome of what we achieve in life. There is a Gujarati saying: \"Ghora Dasarana Divase Na Doda\"—the horse who has been preparing all year for the race on Dashera day does very well in practice, but doesn't run on race day. This is a defining moment for Arjuna. They suffered through all the cruelties and injustices, and now came the time to fight against that. But just looking at the enormity of the task, he realized he's not prepared for it.\n\nFirst, he breaks down in his mental attitude, and then he starts justifying why this task is not for him. His first argument was: By killing our relatives, we are going to incur sin. There is no good going to come out of this war, because we are fighting against our own people—our own uncles, our own teachers, our own grandparents, and our in-laws. So what is the point? For whom do we desire this kingdom? We work hard in our life for the people in our family.\n\nBut if those people in our family are standing against each other and they are ready to destroy each other, what is the point in gaining anything? So there was the first argument. What is the point of fighting this war to get this kingdom? Because for those for whom we are fighting this are ready here to sacrifice their own lives and everything they have on both Sides so he doesn't see really a good outcome. I see bad omen that nothing good is going to come out of it. And then he said, not only that nothing good is going to come out, but killing your own people is a sin.\n\nEven though they are felons, even though they are criminals. So till the time he was seeing the world black and white, there was not much issue. He saw Kauravas as real people and on his side good people, there was not really much problem. He wanted to go eliminate all the evil in this world. But when he saw that evil is not pure evil and good is not pure good, this is what we face in life. Situations we encounter are not black and white.\n\nThey are not cleanly divided between good and bad. Everything in life comes with its own side effects. So any medicine you take is not purely killing the disease, but it will also kill something good in you. So the decision to take is whether the side effects are more important or curing the disease is more important. You take chemotherapy. Obviously there are side effects, but you have to to persevere the side effects to kill the disease.\n\nSo Arjuna is missing that point here. So he's trying to make his argument why this war should not be fought and let those criminals continue doing their criminal acts because they are our relatives. That was his first false argument. If there are other people not my relatives, I will have no problem getting rid of them. But because they are my relatives, I think it's a sin. Even that argument did not make much impression on Krishna.\n\nBecause he was looking for Krishna's validation that his argument is correct. We shouldn't be fighting this war. But he comes to the point that he had already made up his mind. So in verse 37 we have seen that he said tasmat, therefore we shall not fight this war. He's already made up his mind. Previously he made an argument saying I can't stand, I think I'm seeing bad omens.\n\nBut now he said, I have made up my mind, I do not want to fight this war and we should not fight. Not only I should not fight, we should not fight this war because there is nothing good is going to come out of it. Killing our people is sin. That argument did not make any impression on Krishna. So he continued in his argument saying kulakshaye pranashyanti, kuladharmaha sanatanaha. By killing these people we will be killing the family units.\n\nBy fighting this war we'll be killing the head of the family and each family. And once that head of the family is destroyed. The family will be destroyed. These people on the other side, they're not realizing this, that this is the greatest sin to destroy families. But at least we are wise enough to realize the value of family unit, and therefore we should not be committing this sin. So what we are seeing here is the social structure at the time.\n\nThe family was the unit of the society at the time. And the family was not, as we see family now, always a joint family coming from generation to generation, living together and passing on their values from one generation to another. There's always an older generation available to give guidance to the next generation and to enforce the values and the discipline on the second generation. So he said, with that lineage will be broken. Swamiji then points out here that the family unit changed it from a joint family to a couple, husband and wife. So this was Phyllis, Swamiji wrote in 50s and 60s.\n\nIn our time now, that's not a family anymore, or that's not the unit of the society anymore. The unit of the society now is an individual, therefore individual rights. What we are more concerned about in our modern time, previously we have seen a couple's rights were more important. And even today we are fighting about who is considered a couple and who gets the inheritance. But in those days, in Arjuna's time, the family unit was most important, where not one generation, but generations have lived together with each other and passed on their values. You see, when you destroy that lineage of people living together in a family, there will be disaster in the society because you're destroying the unit of the society.\n\nAnd whoever is the cause for the destruction will be the greatest sinner. We know the other people are doing that, but they are ignorant people. We are not ignorant people. Therefore, we shall not engage in the same sinful act. Kulakshaye, Pranashanti, Kula, Dharma, Sanatanah. This eternal Dharma of a family, eternal means because it came from generations, from generations.\n\nMy parents did what they were taught from their parents. Their parents did what they were taught from their parents. That lineage is continuing, and I have a responsibility to pass it on to my next generation. That's called Eternal Kuladharma, that in our family we only do things this way. Dharme, Naste, Kulam, Krishnam, Dharmo, abhi, Bhavyatut. And if Dharma is destroyed, then the entire order in the society will be there, Krishnam.\n\nEntire the whole society. The Dharma of the whole society will be destroyed. As we have seen in our culture, there is Dharma for everything. That which makes you what you are is your Dharma. So I as an individual has a Dharma. I as a member of my family has my own Dharma that I can only act this way.\n\nI as a part of the society has Dharma as a part of the civilized society. How I act and behave, the society has its own Dharma. So all these Dharmas which are dependent on an individual and in this case individual family, Arjuna says they will be all destroyed. The whole society will be in disarray because there is no order. There is no order in the family. Therefore there will not be order in the community.\n\nAnd there is no order in the community. There is no order in the society. And we will be the guilty parties that we started this war. And all this happened. So Adharma bhi bhavat Krishna Pradishyanti Kulastriyaha. And he's trying to demonstrate how this Dharma will now be destroyed.\n\nWhy war will destroy Dharma in the society. Now none of these arguments is invalid. The argument he is making are all valid argument. Because we have seen after wars this does happen. And they may have seen that too. However, at that time, the only remedy was the war.\n\nSometimes the disease is so acute you have to take the side effects with it. But it is more important to kill the disease. Because by fear of the side effects, you don't take the medication, then the disease will kill you. So here it was very important to cure the disease. But Arjuna is now more focused on the side effects. So he's now explaining to Krishna, saying aaa Dharma bhi bhavat Krishna pradishyanti kulastriya ha.\n\nBecause now the society has no order. It will corrupt the women in this society. Now obviously we all get very upset when it comes to this type of statement in our scriptures. But remember one thing. The context of this statement is society at that time, not the society today. Society today has given enough opportunities for women to be independent.\n\nThey can function independently. You don't really need a man to support you. Just two generations ago, that was not really possible. You remember at least? I remember because I'm old enough to remember my older generation, which was relatively living a similar life. So when a daughter is given away, they used to give us three dhan eventually became a dowry.\n\nWas not really a dowry in the olden society. It was given as a security wealth to the woman. If something happens to her husband, she will be protected. She will have means to support herself. There was called Tridhan in the marriage. The parents of the bride will give it to the bride as a gift.\n\nAnd that is Supposed to be very sacred, that you will not touch, that you will not waste, that Sridhan, the husband will have no right to use this Sridhar. There was a security for that woman because there was no other means for her to support herself. Now you can regress it back to 3,500 years ago, when society was completely different, where the division of labor was clearly defined between men and women. Our society had evolved from hunter gatherer society. The hunter gatherer society, there was very clear division of labor. Men will go out and hunt and bring food, women will stay in the caves and take care of children.\n\nObviously you couldn't reverse that in that society. And that was basically a model continued in our society where men went out and worked in the world outside to generate wealth and women took care of the family. Now, if the man is out, the one part of that unit which was responsible to support the family is gone. And if the woman does not have any means to do that, then obviously there will be corruption. Arjuna is making his argument here, that why it is so important to keep the family unit intact. So in that time society, maybe one person dies in a family, but there was other male in the.\n\nIn the family who will be there to take care of the widow and her children.",
      "reflection": "In these verses, Arjuna makes his most elaborate argument yet—a cascade of social consequences. Verse 40: \"Kulakshaye pranashyanti kuladharmah sanatanah\"—when families are destroyed, the ancient family dharmas perish. Verse 41: \"Adharmabhibhavat... pradushyanti kulastriyah\"—when adharma prevails, women become corrupted. Verse 42: \"Sankaro narakayaiva\"—this intermixture leads to hell, and the ancestors fall, deprived of their ritual offerings (pinda and water).\n\nSwamiji contextualizes this for us: these aren't universal truths but reflect the social structure of Arjuna's time, when the family (kula) was the fundamental unit of society. Today, that unit has contracted to the couple, and now to the individual. But the underlying concern—that violent disruption creates cascading social breakdown—remains relevant.\n\nHowever, notice what Arjuna is NOT seeing: the Kauravas had ALREADY destroyed the family. Years of attempted murders, cheating at dice, public humiliation of Draupadi, thirteen years of exile—the fabric was already torn. Arjuna speaks as if he has a choice between preserving an intact family and destroying it. But that choice was made long ago, by others. This is crucial for our own lives. When we face difficult decisions, we sometimes imagine we're choosing between peace and conflict. But often, by the time we face the choice, the damage is done—by others, by circumstances, by time. Our real choice isn't between ideal outcomes but between facing reality and pretending it doesn't exist. Where in your life are you imagining a pristine option that no longer exists? What \"family dharma\" are you trying to preserve that has already been violated by others' actions?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 1, Arjuna Vishada Yoga—the Yoga of Arjuna's Grief. We have come to the final concluding verses of Chapter 1. This chapter paints a scenario where thousands, if not millions, of people have gathered in Kurukshetra to do what they do best—to fight the war. Kurukshetra is also called Dharmakshetra by Dhritarashtra in the first words. Dhritarashtra says, \"I want to know what's happening in Kurukshetra, which is a Dharmakshetra.\"\n\nKurukshetra is analogous to Karmakshetra—the field of action. It's also called Dharmakshetra, which is analogous to a field of action where I can practice my Dharma—that which I'm prepared for. For an architect like me, Dharmakshetra is my office, where I practice the art of architecture. My Dharma as an architect is to design buildings. The field of action that gives me the opportunity to practice that art is my Dharmakshetra.\n\nThis scenario is analogous to the situations we find ourselves in our lives. Every year, universities have graduation ceremonies where we see a sea of students graduating, ready to enter the workforce. Obviously the question in the parent's mind is: Will my son be successful in whatever profession he has prepared himself for? The thought comes to our mind that maybe the one with the most resources will be successful—a person who comes from a good family, has a family background, has a family business. Or the other thought: maybe the one who is well-equipped, a good student with the highest grades, always ahead in class—that person will be the most successful.\n\nBut experience in life shows us that both formulas do not work all the time. They may work sometimes, but not always. What works all the time is character and integrity—that person will certainly be successful in life. Character-building is the goal of any scripture or study of scripture like Bhagavad Gita. Swamiji actually calls the study of Bhagavad Gita the \"Art of Man-Making.\" There are two books on the Art of Man-Making by Swami Chinmayananda.\n\nThey were actually radio lectures by Swami GM Bhagavad Gita, and he called them Art of Man Making. So chapter one has prepared us to introspect and be aware of our own situations. So up till now, before we decided to learn Bhagavad Gita, we were facing the situation, but not very aware of what to look for, how to prepare ourselves for it. So therefore, this chapter is called Arjuna Vishadhi Yoga. And there's always the question why this is the Yoga. Other chapters can be Yoga, but why this chapter is also called Yoga.\n\nThis chapter actually united us with our own situations which we were oblivious about. We did not know why I am doing what and why I am successful or I am failing. We are experiencing all these things, but we did not have a system to analyze and see what makes an activity successful or what makes my actions productive. So the study of Bhagavad Gita will now teach us, will prepare us to see situation comprehensively, and then we can decide how to act in this life. And therefore it's called Arjuna Vishadaya. It connected him to his own situation.\n\nSo so far we have seen in this chapter that Arjun was very anxious while they were preparing for the war. He considered himself to be something similar to a guy who has graduated at the top of his class and now he's entering workforce. He was always the best, and now he has this field of action where he can basically shine out. So typically we would have anticipated that he would be the last person to have any doubt about fighting this war. They already debated whether this war is righteous or not. So before they gathered in the field of Kurukshetra, there were several incidents we see where Arjuna came out very confident.\n\nHe told Sanjay, go tell Duryodhana that when Krishna and I are together, even Indra's army cannot defeat us. Swamiji also points out here that in the beginning of this Bisma Parva there are few _Verses_ where Judhisthe had doubt whether this war is right or not. And Arjuna was the one who gave him the right perspective and he gave him advice that there will be time where fighting war is the only right thing to do for the righteous cause. He said, as long as our cause, they are righteous, we will be the winners. So he's pretty confident. He was in control of his own situation.\n\nAnd then suddenly when he saw all the relatives on both sides, he somehow had nervous breakdown. He had a completely different perception of what's happening. All he's confident about fighting this war not because we want this kingdom, but it's the right thing to do. The cause is right, therefore we have to fight this war. The only thing he saw at that point, I have to kill my own cousins and my own teacher and my own grandfather. So he was more overruled by the attachment than the principal.\n\nSo then we have seen that he had a nervous breakdown, his anxiety, and then he basically has delusion. When he had delusion, he started seeing reality completely differently. Therefore he started making argument about why he does not want to fight this war. So his first argument was, well, they are not smart enough to figure out that this is not a right thing to do, but we are better than them. He put himself on a pedestal saying, I am better than them. They don't know what they are doing, but we know, and therefore we shouldn't be fighting this war.\n\nWhen that argument did not work with Krishna, because he was obviously looking for validation from Krishna that yes, he's on the right path, well, we always try to avoid this war. Arjuna, I'm glad that you realize at the end it's not too late. Let's pack our bags and go home. In verse 37 he has already declared that he said, therefore, let's not participate in this war. We have not heard from Krishna yet. So now he makes a greater moral argument why the war itself is sinful.\n\nWar in any shape and form is sinful. Swamiji says he is the first conscientious objector in the history promoting the pacifist argument about why war should not be fought. Buddha was pacifist, obviously. He promoted that war should not be fought. That was a very different outlook all his life. Right from the beginning.\n\nBuddha saw the thing very differently. Chinmayananda did not see it that way. Suddenly he became pacifist when people were relying on him to fight this battle. So now he makes a moral argument saying that war is sinful because it destroys the family unit. Family unit, which is the basic unit for the society, as we discussed last time, that at that time and even till today, family is the unit which makes any society the families are educated, the society will be educated. So whatever is happening at the microcosm in a family will be happening in the macrocosm in the society.\n\nSo therefore, protecting families is very important, very valid argument he makes then. We have seen that as we progressed in the modern time, the family unit became a couple and the couple became an individual. So now we have individual right is what we are trying to protect. So he makes argument to Krishna that by fighting this war, we'll be destroying families, and therefore we will be the sinners. Because we will be the cause for destroying this family unit, which will ultimately will destroy the entire culture in the society. In a family, the man has the duty to protect and provide for the family.\n\nSo there's a division of labor. Man is providing and protecting the family, woman is nurturing the family. And in that situation, if you take the protector and provider away, the nurturer has no resources to nurture the family. And therefore the nurturer will become corrupt, corruption. She has to do something which is not appropriate for her to get out of her role of nurturer into a provider. And that will eventually make the nurturing part of the family suffer.\n\nIf family is not nurtured, the next generation, the society will suffer. We hear in our society that the children who grow up without any family, they obviously will not have the right values. They do not know what is the right of their life. We have Hindi movies where this hero becomes a gangster because he grew up on the streets and he did not have any support, any guidance from the family. So it's a valid argument he makes that we cannot disrupt this family unit. And therefore he said that we will be the sinner and the one who destroys the family unit.\n\nThat person will go to hell forever. In other words, we will be the cause for creating hell in this society. So it continues argument and says. He makes a moral argument about our responsibility to preserve our culture and social structure. Once we destroy the family, we have destroyed that order. And therefore those men who participate in that, they will go to hell forever.\n\nUtsun kuladharmana Manushyana Janardhana Narake Niyatam Vasaha Bhavati anushushrama. Those men, as you say, will go to hell forever. Traditionally, if you just believe in that, after your death you will be either go to swarga or Narak. Then see in this case, because you definitely going to hell. But Swamiji points out that the broader view of that is that the society will live in hell and you will be part of it. You will be living in hell.\n\nIf the law and order in this society is destroyed by whatever is happening because the corruption people start behaving as if they have all the rights then the overall atmosphere in the society will become not livable every more hellish living. Ahobat Mahatpapam kartum Vyavasita Vayam. You know, basically has concluded his argument and said Ahubat alas Mahat papam kartam Vavasitavayam. He actually tells conclusively to Krishna we engage in this great sin by fighting this war, destroying this family and culture and society. We are sending everyone to hell. Hellish living for everyone.\n\nAnd that is only for Yad Rajya Sukh Lovina. We are only doing it because we want this kingdom. Our greed to have this kingdom is motivating us to engage in this act which is sinful. Yadi Maam pratikaram Asastram Sastra Panayah Dartarashtra Rane Hanyuhu Tanme Shemataram Bhaved. Therefore he is my final decision that even the Dhritarashtra's sons kill me with their weapons and me having no weapons in my hand that will be better for me than killing my own kids and kids. You know, he came to the conclusion that in this life if I can think of what will give me the liberation from my situation that is a better liberation than me fighting the war and winning what is rightfully mine.\n\nHe makes a much greater argument to preserve rightfully theirs with the Kshema. Yoga is something we are trying to achieve which we don't have. Shema is something we have and we are trying to protect it like Shema. So you see, the first argument for fighting this war is for the Shema.",
      "reflection": "In verse 43, Arjuna continues his social argument: \"Utsadyante jatidharmas kuladharmas cha shashvatah\"—the eternal laws of caste and family are destroyed. Verse 44 adds: \"Narake niyatam vaso bhavati\"—such people dwell in hell forever. Then verse 45 delivers his emotional crescendo: \"Aho bata mahat papam kartum vyavasita vayam\"—Alas! We are resolved to commit great sin, ready to kill our own people \"rajya sukha lobhena\"—out of greed for royal pleasures.\n\nNotice the word \"lobha\" (greed)—the same word Arjuna used to describe his enemies in verse 38! He accused them of being \"lobhopahatachetasah\" (minds overpowered by greed), and now he accuses himself and his brothers of the same: \"sukha lobhena\" (greed for pleasure). In his confusion, Arjuna has collapsed the distinction between aggressor and defender, between those who stole a kingdom and those seeking to reclaim it.\n\nSwamiji makes a crucial observation: Arjuna's arguments, though emotionally compelling, are borrowed. Before the war, Dhritarashtra sent Sanjaya to the Pandavas with exactly these arguments: \"War is never good. You are wise people. Find another way.\" Arjuna is now echoing words planted by the very person who enabled his suffering. Reflect on how this happens in our lives: in moments of crisis, whose voices do we internalize? Whose arguments suddenly seem compelling? Sometimes our greatest moments of apparent moral clarity are actually moments when others' agendas have colonized our thinking. Examine your strongest convictions about a current dilemma: are they truly yours, or have they been planted by those who benefit from your inaction?"

So you see, the first argument for fighting this war is for the Shema.",
      "reflection": "Verse 46 contains Arjuna's final, dramatic declaration: \"Yadi mam apratikaram ashastram shastra-panayah dhartarashtrah rane hanyuh tan me kshemataram bhavet\"—If Dhritarashtra's sons, weapons in hand, were to kill me unarmed and unresisting on the battlefield, that would be BETTER for my welfare (kshemataram). This is complete psychological collapse—the greatest warrior in the world declaring that being killed defenseless would be preferable to fighting.\n\nThen verse 47, the chapter's conclusion: \"Evam uktva arjunah sankhye rathopastha upavishat, visrijya sa-sharam chapam shoka-samvigna-manasah\"—Having spoken thus, Arjuna sat down on the seat of his chariot in the midst of battle, casting aside his bow and arrows, his mind overwhelmed with grief (shoka). The image is complete: the hero who commanded Krishna confidently now sits collapsed, weapon abandoned, heart broken.\n\nThis is why the chapter is called \"Arjuna Vishada Yoga\"—the Yoga of Arjuna's Despair. \"Yoga\" means union, connection. Through his grief, Arjuna has finally connected with the true complexity of his situation. His previous confidence was based on incomplete seeing. Now, overwhelmed, he is finally ready to learn. The Gita teaches that wisdom often begins in crisis, that the shattering of false certainty creates space for true understanding. Swamiji calls this \"the Art of Man-Making\"—character is built not in ease but in struggle. Reflect on your own \"verse 47 moments\"—times when you've sat down in the midst of battle, dropped your weapons, overwhelmed. These moments, painful as they are, may be exactly when you become ready for deeper teaching. What wisdom might be waiting for you on the other side of your current despair?"

      "commentary": "We will be discussing chapter two, Sankhya Yoga. Yoga of Knowledge means uniting with the knowledge. The knowledge can be generally classified into two categories. One is secular knowledge and sacred. Secular is the knowledge about the world of objects. So even to get the secular knowledge, what we generally have to do is to make observations of the objects and then understand them.\n\nSo all the objects in the world which we know about today are not dependent on my personal observation, my personal understanding. Generations of scientists, mathematicians, and experimenters have gathered this information and passed them to us. So our knowledge is based on the efforts of generations of great thinkers. Sacred knowledge is something similar. The knowledge about the self is also not my personal experience right now; I have to depend on the generations of sages who very carefully contemplated on the nature of the self.\n\nAnd those declarations are basically recorded in Vedas in our tradition. The knowledge they gained in their contemplation, in their observation, in their meditations are recorded as declarations in the Vedas. \"Veda\" comes from \"vid,\" to know -- so the Vedas are literally the books of knowledge. So there are four Vedas, Rukh, Sam, Yajur and Atharva. Based on the declarations of Vedas, there are six Darshan Shastras in our traditions. Various masters have taken those declarations and formulated a school of philosophy to explain the truth, the nature of the self.\n\nAnd that became the six schools of philosophy. In our tradition they can be generally categorized into three main categories. The first is called Tarka Logic. They come to the conclusion about what the truth is by logical conclusions. So that's called Tarka. And there are two great masters, Kannada and Gautam.\n\nThey formed their Darsana Sastra, which are called Vaisheshika and Nyaya. Out of the six schools, five of them do not believe that God can be realized by meditation and knowledge. Only the last one, Vedanta, recognized the fact that God can be realized by meditation and knowledge. So as I said, they can be classified into three categories. The first is Tarka, which is logic. Second is Sankhya, which is the logical enumeration of the facts.\n\nVery logical argument about what is the truth and how we come to that conclusion. And Kapil Muni is the author of Sankhya philosophy. But he did not include the Creator Ishvara or the God Principle in his philosophy. So his Darshan Sastra is Nir-Ishwara -- Ishwara is not included in his thesis. But then Patanjali included Isvara in the same Sankhya philosophy.\n\nSo it becomes Sa-Ishwara Sankhya. The last category is called Mimamsa -- deliberations. Deliberating the facts which are available to us and coming to the conclusion of what is the real truth. So the declarations in Vedas are in basically two general categories. The earlier part of Vedas is called Karmakanda. The later part of the Vedas called Jnanakanda. The deliberations made based on the earlier part of the Vedas is called Purva Mimsa.\n\nJaimini Rishi made his treatise on this Purva Mimamsa -- a methodical path of how to achieve the ultimate goal. The ultimate goal in Purva Vimansa is to go to heaven. All the good deeds and good rituals -- when you perform them and acquire merits (Punya), then you are given a place to experience happiness and peace and bliss. And that state is called Swarga. So the goal of life as per Purva Mimamsa is to achieve Swarga. Now, based on the Jnanakanda --\n\nThe later part of the Vedas, the Darsam Shastra which was developed by Sage Badarayan is called Uttar Mimansa. The Uttar Mimamsa is the one that recognized the one single entity, Brahman. Various teachers and Acharyas have taken the basis from one or the other of Darshana Shastra and created the schools of thoughts in our culture. And they are basically three Dvaita, the dualistic school. God and I are two different entities. They will never become one.\n\nGod is the Master and I am his servant. Madhvacharya founded this dualistic school of thought. Ramanujacharya established Visisht Advaita which says God is the whole and I am a part of Him. So most of our Vaishnava Sampradha is based on Vishist Advaita. Then the last one is Adhvaita. Bhagavan Shankaracharya established the school of thought called Advaita based on Vedanta. Vedanta literally means \"end of Vedas.\" At the end of the Vedas we have the Upanishads, whose declarations say that myself and God are one and the same. Tattvamasi that thou art, that which I am seeking is none other than my own self. That school is called Advaita philosophy, non dualistic school of thought. People have seen the Bhagavad Gita from all these different points of view. In our tradition -- the Chinmaya Mission tradition, or Shankaracharya's tradition -- we typically look at it from the non-dualistic school of thought. This chapter combines all these various schools of thought into an understandable philosophy, taking the salient points of all three.\n\nBut in nature this chapter is still Advaitic. And therefore we have the saying in Sanskrit that the Gita rains the nectar of Advaita, which teaches us that myself and God's self are one and the same. So therefore this chapter is titled Sankhya Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge, predominantly based on the Sankhya philosophy of logical conclusions. So it is more scientific and modern in its approach towards the truth. All our Upanishads are in the form of dialogues between student and the teacher. The student asks a question, and the teacher answers or gives guidance. So it is never to be taken without any understanding. If you don't understand, ask questions. Bhagavad Gita is basically in the same format. Bhagavan gives advice Arjuna, if he does not understand, he stops him and says let me tell you what I don't understand. So that's the tradition where you do not take anything for granted without understanding it.\n\nSo Chapter 2, Sankhya Yoga, is now giving us a thumbnail picture of the core declarations in the Vedas. In modern-day presentation, effective communication generally has three parts: tell them what you're going to tell them, then tell them, and then tell them what you told them. You go to any professional meeting -- you have an agenda. You tell them what we're going to discuss today, then you hold a discussion on those items, and at the end of the meeting you conclude with action items and what we agreed on.\n\nSo that tradition is started by Bhagawan Vedvyasan, not our marketing guru. So chapter two will tell us what we will be discussing throughout Bhagavad Gita. Then we'll be discussing Bhagavad Gita and Chapter 18 will tell us what we discussed all throughout Bhagavad Gita -- the conclusion, the action items, what we have to do now after having learned Bhagavad Gita. So the Sankhya Yoga is yoga of knowledge. Assuming that I don't have the knowledge right now, therefore I'm going to learn.\n\nSo chapter one gave us the scenario of our life situations. We typically live our life by complaining about injustices, discriminations, unfairness. And therefore what we do is we try to prepare ourselves for overcoming those obstacles. That's what we call education, training, internships. These are basically our preparations. Now is the preparation good enough to achieve success and happiness in life?\n\nThere's something more. All the graduates who come out from the university, they don't achieve exactly the same results. They're all prepared with similar training, yet they don't achieve the same results. Why? Because there is something else where they differ from each other -- their inner strength, inner qualities, and inner understandings of how to deal with situations.\n\nWhen you encounter a situation, will you be able to take the right decision? What to do and what not to do is basically the training in the spiritual quest. If we have the clear understanding about what my position is in this situation and what my role is in this situation, then I'll be able to take the decision correctly. If I represent a company, when I go to a meeting with my client, if I have clear understanding what my role is as a company employee, then what my goal is here, then I will take the right decision. But if I misunderstand my role and introduce my personal objectives and personality into that discussion, then I as a company representative will fail. I actually never get chances to be on a selection side of an interview.\n\nTypically I'm more a candidate for pitching our services to other people. Once in a while I get an opportunity to be on a selection site to interview contractors. And I just had one interview like that. And after the three or four candidates we interviewed were obviously sitting down and making selections. So there were four or five people in that room. And you can tell that some people are completely unbiased and they really have no extra grind.\n\nBut then there are some people who say, yeah, but I know that guy and I like him. So I'm now injecting my personal bias into the decision making process. If you take that personal bias out of it, your decision will be relatively correct. But once you start seeing it through your personal bias, your decision will be deluded. May or may not be correct. So what we have seen in chapter one is when your personal attachments and biases are overwhelming you in facing the situation, the chances of your failure is much greater.\n\nSo you have seen the Arjuna when he was part of the Pandava's army as a general, he was very enthusiastic and very, very confident about his ability to fight. But as soon as he starts seeing other people as his relatives, he basically introduced his own attachment to them and that's where he got confused and broken down. So that was the scenario of the first chapter, basically gave us a mirror to our own situation why we fail in some situation and we succeed in other situations. The situations where I was overwhelmed by my own attachment and biases, it did not let me take the right decision. Situation where I have kept myself out of personal biases and saw the situation through a correct lens. If I was a part of a community, part of a country, as a citizen, or a part of a company, as a company representative, I take the right decision.\n\nSo chapter two obviously starts with continuation of the dialogue between Arjuna and Krishna. Mainly Arjuna spoke about himself. Krishna has not said anything. Sanjay has been narrating it to Dhritarashtra. So Chapter 2 starts with Sanjaya reporting back to Dhritarashtra -- Tam Tatha Krupaya Avistam -- simply reporting to Dhritarashtra that this is what Krishna said to Arjuna. Because it may be possible that listening to Arjuna, Dhrutrashtra may have developed some hope that I think this is going to be the end of it.\n\nI think Arjuna is going to convince Krishna to let's pack our bags and go home. And when Arjuna is not there, either they all will go back or even if they fight, they are not going to win without Arjuna. So Dhritarasra may have some hope that the strategy is working. Arjuna is now broken down completely in this psychological warfare between what is right and wrong. Our emissaries went there, their emissaries came here. We put our argument, they put theirs -- we won over Arjuna.\n\nSo Sanjay says, wait a minute, let me tell you what Krishna told him. Tam Tatha Tam to him Tatha Das Krupaya Avistam. He is describing Arjuna's condition. Krupaya Avistam is overwhelmed by pity. Ashra Purna is crying. Can you imagine a general in the army on the battlefield, ready to fight, crying.",
      "reflection": "In these opening verses of Chapter 2, we witness Krishna's first response to Arjuna's despair. The Lord does not offer sympathy or validate Arjuna's emotional breakdown. Instead, He challenges him directly: \"Where has this weakness come from? This is not fitting for one who knows Dharma.\" Krishna's words remind us that when we are overwhelmed by attachment and emotion, we often mistake our confusion for wisdom, our fears for valid concerns.\n\nConsider today: When have you let emotional attachment or personal bias cloud your judgment in a difficult situation? Like Arjuna, we often prepare thoroughly for life's challenges through education and training, yet find ourselves paralyzed when the moment arrives. The difference between success and failure often lies not in our preparation, but in our inner clarity when facing the situation. Krishna's response teaches us that sometimes what we need is not sympathy, but a wake-up call to rise above our self-imposed limitations.\n\nReflect on this question: What situation in your life right now are you approaching with \"tears in your eyes\" - clouded by personal attachments rather than clear vision of your duty? What would it mean to \"shake off this shameful effeminacy and make ready to act,\" as Krishna urges Arjuna?"

      "reflection": "Arjuna's anguish in these verses reflects a universal human dilemma: How can I act against those I revere and love, even when duty demands it? He protests that he would rather beg for food than enjoy pleasures \"stained with the blood\" of his teachers Bhishma and Drona. This is not mere sentimentality - it is the voice of deep moral conflict. Yet notice how Arjuna's reasoning, though emotionally compelling, is fundamentally self-centered: \"How can I fight them? I would no longer care to live if I killed them.\"\n\nToday, examine your own life for similar conflicts where you rationalize inaction because taking right action seems too painful. Perhaps it is a difficult conversation you avoid with a family member, a professional boundary you fear to set, or a truth you hesitate to speak. Like Arjuna, we often dress up our fears in noble-sounding arguments. We say \"I cannot hurt them\" when we really mean \"I cannot bear the discomfort of this situation.\"\n\nAsk yourself: Where in my life am I using respect or love as an excuse to avoid my responsibilities? What \"begging for food\" - settling for less than I am capable of - am I willing to accept rather than face a necessary challenge? Remember, the pleasures we enjoy while avoiding our duty are indeed \"stained with blood\" - the blood of our own unfulfilled potential."

      ],
      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter two. We have seen in the first few verses that Arjuna continues to argue about why he feels that he should not be fighting. Obviously, we have spent the whole chapter one listening to his argument. Then Bhagavan told him that why are you behaving this way? Where does this un Aryan like importance come upon you? In other words, this behavior which is not fitting to somebody who is civilized and trained about Dharma.\n\nAs we have seen that in our culture everything is defined by Dharma. So whatever the basic qualities of the thing are being that defines who that person is. So we have broadly a Manavadharma, what is the Dharma of a human being? We generally define the Dharma of a human being is to act according to his true self, which is Divinity, the expression of the God. So our Dharma as human being is to align our actions in line with the divinity. So everything we do should be keeping in mind that my true Dharma is divinity and therefore I'm acting in that manner.\n\nThen obviously we come down to now that I have aligned myself to divinity. I'm now just playing a role in this life or in this state, or in this time. Now, whatever the role I'm playing at that time will define what my Dharma is. My Dharma from Monday through Friday is to act as an architect. So that time, what is right for me is defined by the role I have taken. On Sunday it will be different.\n\nIf I start talking about architecture here, it will be very inappropriate. So my Dharma changes as per the time and role I am taking. There is no universally I can say that if I behave this way will be appropriate. I have to find what is the time I am in and what the role I have taken and then find what is my appropriate dharma. Arjuna right now is in a battlefield leading an army. Their army is depending on him on his strength and capability to win this war.\n\nAnd now he wants to go back. Therefore Bhagavan said where the Un Aryan like behavior come upon you because as an Arya he was taught what is Dharma of a Kshatriya Kshatriya Dharma is when he is facing an enemy is to fight. Once he has decided this is the right battle, he has to fight. So Bhagavanti, where does this behavior come from? Is it something that somebody was not clear enough while teaching you what a Dharmapakshatriya is? Or what is your Dharma as a prince?\n\nOr what is your Dharma as one of the Pandavas? Where is this behavior come from? So Arjuna obviously was not expecting that. He was expecting some sympathetic words. So he continues to make his point. But then he realized that there may be something I'm completely missing here, that all my arguments up till now has not made any impression on Krishna.\n\nSo there may be something I need to think about what is right. And maybe I'm not capable of thinking what is right. So in the next few verses, Arjuna says: Karpanya Dosho Upahata Svabhavaha Pricchami Tvam. \"I made my argument thinking that what I'm thinking is right, that this is my Dharma -- not to kill my teacher, not to kill my great grandfather, not to kill my cousins.\n\nFor a while I thought, that's my Dharma. Now you are telling me that that's not my Dharma, that this is not Arya-like behavior. Therefore Dharma Sammudha Chetah -- I am completely confused about what is Dharma right now.\" I do not know what my Dharma is. Pruchamitam, I am asking you, someone who is confused about his Dharma.\n\nWhat is my Dharma right now? What am I supposed to be doing at this time? Karpanya do so Aphatvah. My own nature is overwhelmed by this pity, pity on me that I am facing the situation. I don't know what I am doing. Normally I'm in my control.\n\nNormally I know what I'm supposed to be doing from my training, from my own intellect. I know in this situation how I should be behaving, which is most appropriate. But looks like my whole subhava. My nature is overwhelmed by this pity about my own situation which I'm facing. Therefore, I am Dharma Sammudhaha -- I am completely deluded about what is my Dharma.\n\nIs it not killing them is my Dharma. Not fighting this war is my Dharma or fighting this war is my Dharma. Yat sreihaat nishitam bruhi tanme. Therefore you tell me with definitive guidance what is right for me. Up till now he was using his own intellect and ego to come up with what is right and wrong. Then he put forward his argument.\n\nThis is something, an indication to us that sometimes what we think through our intellect may not be right. We do come up with all this argument about why I'm doing this. You know, why I don't make any donation because they are all corrupt and all these organizations are corrupt. Why should I be supporting them? All this nice argument which I come up with, they may be just my own delusion. As long as I hang on to my ego and my intellect to come up with the right answer.\n\nThere may be right answer or there may be wrong answer. So right now, because you are telling me that what I was thinking is not right, I'm assuming that I'm completely deluded. Now you tell me what is right for me. We go to ask advice, but typically we are not really ready to listen to the advice. We go to somebody and say, you know, this is what I'm doing. This is the situation.\n\nWhat do you think I should be doing? You know, the best thing for you to do is this. And you say, yeah, but I don't think I'll be able to. Because then you can say, well, what does he know? I mean, obviously he doesn't know everything. We know what situation we are in.\n\nWe are really asking for advice just to get confirmation of what I'm thinking that somebody, yes, yes, you are right. You shouldn't be doing that. I think what you did is very right. That's what we're really looking for. We just need a little pat on our back saying, I think, Neil, you're so smart. You figured out what to do.\n\nWe are not really looking for advice. Sisya Deham, I am your student. In our culture, Guru Sishya, relationship is very unique. It is very different from a father and a son or a mother and a son or a friend. Shishya completely surrenders to the Guru once he finds that the Guru is appropriate. After that, there is no argument about what Guru says.\n\nOnce he has surrendered to the Guru, then Guru tells him what to do and he does it. It is not a relationship between a professor and a student. Students can argue here, there. Once I have decided that's my Guru, I have completely surrendered to him, and then whatever he says, without any argument, I will follow. Because I have done all my homework before -- whether this should be my Guru, whether I should be learning this particular thing from him or not. Once that homework is done, I have completely surrendered. So he makes it clear to Krishna that I'm not just simply asking advice from you because I'm confused. I'm surrendering to you. Therefore, now you tell me what is Good for me and I will follow that. Sadhimam Tvam Prapannam I have taken refuge in you.\n\nI have completely given up that I can come up with the right answer in this situation what is right and wrong. But I am now your student. You who will tell me what is right and wrong for me. And whatever you tell me, I will do it now. One thing I learned many, many years ago -- and not from any of the Swamis, but from Dr. Naidu, in whose house we used to do the classes. He actually made me understand what surrender is.\n\nSurrender is something when you feel completely helpless. We go to temple and say I surrender to you Lord. But we are really not. We really want to make sure that I am in control, who is behind me, who is ahead of me. They would be paying attention that I am putting donation. So we are not really surrendering.\n\nSurrender is when I completely feel helpless. The example Dr. Naidu gave me, which really stuck with me: two armies are fighting, and when does the one king decide he's going to surrender? When he feels completely helpless that there is no way he's going to win this battle, he surrenders to the other army. At that point he's completely helpless, completely at the mercy of the other king.\n\nThe story of Porus and Alexander -- when Porus surrendered, Alexander asked him, \"How do you want me to treat you?\" And Porus said, \"Treat me like a king.\" Because at that point he has no other choice but to say I surrender. Now you can treat me the way you want. But you asked me, so I'm telling you, treat me like a king. So that's a surrender.\n\nSurrender happens when you really feel that you don't have any other way out. And I surrender to you. Arjuna came to that point that my ego, my intellect, my all this training is of no value right now. I can't come up with an answer which is going to be satisfactory to me or to you. Therefore I'm now your student. I'm asking you to teach me what is right and wrong.\n\nThen tell me without giving options. If Krishna gives two options -- one, do this, and second, do that -- I'm again confused. Don't give me options. You know, when I came to this country, I must have told this story many, many times.\n\nBut when I was in Africa to get a new car, you had to get in line, you had to register yourself. And then after two or three years you get notification from the dealership saying now your car has arrived and you can get it. So to get a new car then everybody wants to get a new car. Everybody will come and congratulate you. Oh, that's a new car. Oh, when did you register it?\n\nSo my boss told me go and get a new car. So I come and tell everybody and they said, your boss is joking with you because by the time you get your new car you probably will be working someplace else. So I made all my effort to use all my influence to get a new car within six months. And I was very proud. And as people have predicted, after eight months I was in the United States. I told my brother in law that it looks like there is no public transportation in this country.\n\nHe said no problem, we'll go over the weekend. Do you want to wait till weekend? He said, don't worry, we'll go over the weekend. Over the weekend he takes me first to a Chrysler's dealership and there are cars till my eyes can see in the parking lot or that lot. And he said, you can select any car, but let me tell you. And I said, you just tell me which car I should be buying.\n\nHe said, this is just Chrysler. Then we are going to go to gm, then we'll go to Ford and then if you like we can go to Toyota or other Japanese car. And I say I'm getting dizzy, you just tell me which car I should be buying. That's how Arjuna feels -- don't give me options, just tell me definitively what is right.",
      "reflection": "These verses mark a profound turning point: Arjuna admits \"My heart is oppressed with pity; my mind confused as to what my duty is\" and declares \"I am Thy disciple. Please direct me.\" This is the moment of true surrender - not when we pretend to give up control while secretly holding onto our opinions, but when we genuinely acknowledge that our own intellect has failed us. Arjuna recognizes that even ruling \"the monarchy of the visible world\" would not drive away his anguish.\n\nTrue surrender, as taught here, happens when we feel completely helpless - like a defeated king who has no choice but to accept the mercy of his conqueror. We often go to others for advice while secretly wanting only validation of what we have already decided. Arjuna does something different: \"Tell me what is best for my spiritual welfare... without any options.\" He asks not for sympathy but for definitive guidance, committing in advance to follow whatever Krishna says.\n\nReflect today: When did you last truly surrender a decision to higher wisdom - whether to a teacher, to God, or to your own deeper conscience - without reserving the right to argue or reject the answer? What problem in your life might benefit from such complete surrender? Consider that the very act of admitting \"I don't know what to do\" with humility can be the doorway to genuine wisdom. Are you willing to be a true student, ready to follow guidance even if it contradicts your preferences?"

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter two. We have seen in the first few verses that Arjuna continues to argue about why he feels that he should not be fighting. Obviously, we have spent the whole chapter one listening to his argument. Then Bhagavan told him that why are you behaving this way? Where does this un Aryan like importance come upon you? In other words, this behavior which is not fitting to somebody who is civilized and trained about Dharma.\n\nAs we have seen that in our culture everything is defined by Dharma. So whatever the basic qualities of the thing are being that defines who that person is. So we have broadly a Manavadharma, what is the Dharma of a human being? We generally define the Dharma of a human being is to act according to his true self, which is Divinity, the expression of the God. So our Dharma as human being is to align our actions in line with the divinity. So everything we do should be keeping in mind that my true Dharma is divinity and therefore I'm acting in that manner.\n\nThen obviously we come down to now that I have aligned myself to divinity. I'm now just playing a role in this life or in this state, or in this time. Now, whatever the role I'm playing at that time will define what my Dharma is. My Dharma from Monday through Friday is to act as an architect. So that time, what is right for me is defined by the role I have taken. On Sunday it will be different.\n\nIf I start talking about architecture here, it will be very inappropriate. So my Dharma changes as per the time and role I am taking. There is no universally I can say that if I behave this way will be appropriate. I have to find what is the time I am in and what the role I have taken and then find what is my appropriate dharma. Arjuna right now is in a battlefield leading an army. Their army is depending on him on his strength and capability to win this war.\n\nAnd now he wants to go back. Therefore Bhagavan said where the Un Aryan like behavior come upon you because as an Arya he was taught what is Dharma of a Kshatriya Kshatriya Dharma is when he is facing an enemy is to fight. Once he has decided this is the right battle, he has to fight. So Bhagavanti, where does this behavior come from? Is it something that somebody was not clear enough while teaching you what a Dharmapakshatriya is? Or what is your Dharma as a prince?\n\nOr what is your Dharma as one of the Pandavas? Where is this behavior come from? So Arjuna obviously was not expecting that. He was expecting some sympathetic words. So he continues to make his point. But then he realized that there may be something I'm completely missing here, that all my arguments up till now has not made any impression on Krishna.\n\nSo there may be something I need to think about what is right. And maybe I'm not capable of thinking what is right. So in the next few verses, Arjuna says: Karpanya Dosho Upahata Svabhavaha Pricchami Tvam. \"I made my argument thinking that what I'm thinking is right, that this is my Dharma -- not to kill my teacher, not to kill my great grandfather, not to kill my cousins.\n\nFor a while I thought, that's my Dharma. Now you are telling me that that's not my Dharma, that this is not Arya-like behavior. Therefore Dharma Sammudha Chetah -- I am completely confused about what is Dharma right now.\" I do not know what my Dharma is. Pruchamitam, I am asking you, someone who is confused about his Dharma.\n\nWhat is my Dharma right now? What am I supposed to be doing at this time? Karpanya do so Aphatvah. My own nature is overwhelmed by this pity, pity on me that I am facing the situation. I don't know what I am doing. Normally I'm in my control.\n\nNormally I know what I'm supposed to be doing from my training, from my own intellect. I know in this situation how I should be behaving, which is most appropriate. But looks like my whole subhava. My nature is overwhelmed by this pity about my own situation which I'm facing.

      "reflection": "Notice how Krishna responds to Arjuna's despair - not with sympathy, but with a \"gracious smile.\" This smile is significant: it reflects the perspective of one who sees beyond the immediate drama to eternal truths. Krishna's first teaching strikes at the root: \"Why grieve for those for whom no grief is due, and yet profess wisdom? The wise grieve neither for the dead nor the living.\" Then comes the revolutionary declaration: \"There was never a time when I was not, nor thou, nor these princes were not; there will never be a time when we shall cease to be.\"\n\nThis is not mere philosophy but a complete paradigm shift. We spend our lives believing we are temporary beings who will one day cease to exist. Krishna says the opposite is true: we are eternal beings who have always existed and always will. The body changes from infancy to youth to old age, but the \"I\" experiencing these changes remains constant. This same \"I\" will continue through the change called death.\n\nContemplate today: If you truly accepted that you are an eternal being temporarily wearing this body, how would it change your relationship with fear? With loss? With death itself? When you worry about aging, illness, or mortality, pause and ask: \"Who is it that is aware of these changes? That awareness - is it also changing?\" Notice that the witness of change itself remains unchanged. This is the beginning of Self-knowledge."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 2, Sankhya Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge. And so far we had seen that just in the beginning, right away, as soon as Bhagavan started his discourse, he came out without waffling about what is the truth. He says, you and I are imperishable. So are all these people which you see them around you, all these kings. A complete paradigm shift for a normal person who considers himself to be perishable. I was born at one time and I'll die at other time.\n\nIn between is my life. So I'm a perishable entity. Bhagavan said, no, neither you nor I are perishable. There was never a time that you did not exist, or I did not exist, or all these people around you did not exist. The existence is permanent. I may not exist in the same form and state.\n\nI'm existing today as I existed as a child before and I'm existing as an old man now, but still I exist for that I. There is no non existence. So that's a complete paradigm shift and without any explanation. Bhagavan said, the first thing you should know is you're imperishable. And then he goes into the explanation, because he realized that at the stage Arjuna is in, simple advice like \"this is your action, these are your duties, you should do this\" is not enough.\n\nForget about what they did in the past. It's not going to work. This is a disease which has to be cured at its root cause. The root cause of all the disease or all the problems we have is the desire and attachment which is born out of my ignorance about what the reality is. If I'm deluded by this world and my relationship with it, the only way you can cure it is to cure the root cause of it.\n\nTherefore, Bhagavan Buddha said, cure the disease of desire and everything will be cured. No matter how much we help somebody, as long as the root cause is not cured, it will be a band-aid solution as we call it. In architecture, even though the term is borrowed from medicine, we also call it a band-aid solution. You want to fix it permanently? Well, let's demolish this building and build a new one. Bhagavan realized that just telling Arjuna what is his duty now and what will be right for you is not going to help.\n\nLet's start from the beginning. What is your problem? You are afraid that you will be killing these people? Well, you are incapable of killing these people because they are imperishable. The other day our Dr. Chinmayananda Lothe was trying to tell us how indestructible his glasses are. He said, \"You know, the one good thing about these glasses...\" -- and by the time he finishes the sentence, they broke into two pieces! His whole demonstration of indestructibility fell apart right in front of him. \"Boy, I need new glasses now.\" So sometimes what we consider imperishable turns out to be perishable; things we consider indestructible turn out to be quite destructible. So in this life, what I consider is my security blanket, which I consider to be imperishable.\n\nBecause I think I'm in control. I have taken care of everything. The things which I rely on as dependable may turn out to be undependable. So from Arjuna's point of view, he was depending on his teachers and his grandfather -- he thought his family, his dynasty, his culture all depended on them. And Bhagavan said, that may not be true in the way you think.\n\nHowever, what is true is this: you are indestructible, and they are indestructible at the core of their being. Then he says, why don't I feel it that way? Dehino Asmin Yatha Dehe Kaumaram Yauvanam Jara. The classical example we use all the time: just as I have changed from my existence as a child to young man to an adult, and I still remain the same. The feeling which I have as I is exactly same today as it was when I was a young man and when I was a child.\n\nI always see other people as old people. I never see myself as old. It's a very strange phenomenon -- I don't know whether anybody can vouch for this. I can tell you, I never feel I'm old. I actually feel the same way as when I was young: \"I can do that!\" I look at others and think, these people are old, they cannot do it. Then I realize that person is actually younger than me. You know, Swami Dheerananda used to come to Richmond. They would say, \"Swamiji, let me take your bag.\" And he would say, \"Moonkanish, forget it! I'm much younger than you are.\"\n\nI have more strength than you do, so don't worry about my bag. But we always feel at the core, core of our heart were indestructible. The same person as I was when I used to have all the real strength. That's why the middle aged people go to play the sports which they are supposed not to play at their age. I want to play cricket. I really like cricket because I used to play cricket when I was 20 years old.\n\nWell, you try that today. Then after about two or three games, you realize that that's not the thing you should be doing at the age of whatever you are today. So at the core of your being there is no change. Change is happening in the outside existence which you have, which is your body. Just as you have changed from a young age to old age. The same way this self will move from one body to another.\n\nHe introduces the concept of reincarnation right away. In the first verse he said you're indestructible; in the second verse he says this death is nothing. These are shock treatments to somebody whose mind has gone into a complete delusion. They can't see the reality as is. And as all these psychiatric treatments used to be shock treatment, you have to jolt him out of that state. Basically, Bhagawan is giving a shock treatment.\n\nWe are all deluded by our own reality. Our own security blankets our own thinking about what is right and wrong. And he said, starts from this you are imperishable. You will continue to exist in one form or another. Therefore, in any culture, and particularly in ours, suicide is never prescribed. Suicide does not solve anything -- it exactly takes the same mental problem you have to the next stage of life. You're just running away from your problems. Swamiji used to say, if you are unhappy here, if you say, I am so unhappy in us, I am going to go to India and then I will be happy. You will be exactly same unhappy person in India. Except the place will change. As long as the internal climate you are taking with you, things are not going to change for you.\n\nSo you have to change your internal climate. Bhagavan gives you a shock treatment. First: you're imperishable, not perishable. Secondly: death is not going to change anything fundamental -- you will start all over again in a new body. And then he addresses the question: why then do we feel what we feel in our day to day life?\n\nThese changes in my life keep occurring -- some are pleasant and some are unpleasant. The answer is in the verse: Matra Sparsaha Tu Kaunteya Sita Ushna Sukha Dukhadaha. Here is the simple analysis of how your experiences are defined. When your senses come in contact with sense objects, it gives rise to the experience of pleasure and pain, heat and cold. No two people feel the same way about the climate.\n\nSomebody in the room, it's too hot. Neil, can you check another person say I'm perfectly fine, don't touch it. Meena will say it's too hot and also no, it's too cold. And she will say it's too cold. I say no, it's too hot. I think our thermostats work differently.\n\nInternal thermostats. So the experience of heat and cold depends on two things. Outside world which has obviously this condition, but also my sensitivity. My senses, its own sensitivity decides whether it is pleasant or unpleasant. Swamiji's classical example of the cigarette smoker: a cigarette gives one person a heavenly experience. I'm a reform smoker, so I know exactly what I'm talking about.\n\nWhen I was in college and when we are in the dining hall, not interested in meal, when can I finish there and go and have a cigarette outside? That was more enjoyable. The cigarette after the dinner or lunch or any time. Then the lunch itself or dinner itself. Same cigarette gives a repulsive reaction from somebody else. Now I'm a reformed smoker, so I'm the worst one and I can't really tolerate even the smell of cigarette.\n\nWe have one smoker in my office. Every about an hour he goes out, smokes and come back. And then he feels obliged. Every time he goes out there he needs to say something to me and I say, well, you go away. I really don't want to talk to you right now because you're smelling cigarettes all over my office. The same object which gives pleasure to someone, gives pain to someone.\n\nWhat it tells you is object has no capacity to give a pleasure or pain. It is your senses which decides which is pleasurable or painful. So Bhagavan said, matras parsaha tu kaunteya sita ushna sukhdukh daha. This context between the senses and sense objects are the cause of all the experiences you have. So if you remove yourself from the senses because you don't think you are your senses, then these experiences are not yours. Experiences of my car are not Mine.\n\nSo my experience of my eyes, I consider mine and I consider my eye to be me. But I don't consider my glasses to be me. My glasses are not me because I can go to lens craft and get it done in one hour. I know that my eye, I cannot. I have to rely on Santa Ramji and his colleagues to say, make sure that it's functioning well because of that attachment, that identification with the eye which makes me feel it is me. But one says this identification with your senses, that your senses are.\n\nYou transfer all those experiences to you, whether it is heat or cold, pain or pleasure. So understand, these are not your experiences. These are the experiences of these senses when they come in contact with sense objects. And it depends on your sensitivity, your sense of you will feel whether pleasure or pain. My mother, I remember she can pick up the burning charcoal and then put it. I said, don't you need it?\n\nHe said, no, I'm fine. Now I can't even pick up the hot cup of tea because her fingers are numbed by all those cooking. He can pick up charcoal and put it in. When we came to this country, you had to get the fingerprinting done at the airport because you come on a green card. Well, obviously they have a green card. They make your fingerprint, put it on a green card, sealed it in their plastic and give it.\n\nThat's a green card, sir. Meena comes after me. The guy tried and tried and tried and tried and couldn't get a fingerprint done. Sir, I'm sorry, but your wife probably have to go to the downtown in Houston to get this fingerprint done. We don't have capability to take a fingerprint. I said, what's the problem?\n\nHe said, because her ridges are all worn out from the chemicals she uses while doing dishes. So we may have special machine in downtown Houston which may be able to do it, but we can't do it.",
      "reflection": "Krishna offers a profound analogy in verse 13: Just as the soul experiences infancy, youth, and old age within this body, so it passes into another body at death. \"The wise have no delusion about this.\" We accept the daily changes of our body without confusion about our identity - we do not grieve when our childhood body \"dies\" into our adult body. Similarly, the transition from one lifetime to another is simply a continuation of this natural process of change.\n\nVerse 14 introduces the teaching about sensory experiences: \"Those external relations which bring cold and heat, pain and happiness - they come and go; they are not permanent. Endure them bravely.\" Notice that the same experience - hot weather, for instance - can be pleasant to one person and painful to another. This proves that the pleasure or pain is not inherent in the object but depends on our own senses and their sensitivity. Understanding this frees us from being enslaved by circumstances.\n\nToday, practice observing your reactions to pleasant and unpleasant experiences with this awareness: \"This sensation is the result of my senses contacting an object. It is temporary. It will pass.\" When something uncomfortable happens - physical discomfort, an annoying situation, disappointing news - remind yourself: \"This too shall pass.\" And equally, when something pleasant occurs, recognize its temporary nature without clinging. The one \"who accepts pleasure and pain with equanimity\" is declared fit for immortality. What would it mean to \"endure bravely\" the fluctuations of your day?"

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing Chapter 2, Sankhya Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge. This is the knowledge about our true self. So verse 11 through 30 give us the Upanishaddic definition of what the self is all about. So Bhagawan starts with telling Arjuna that you should start looking at this world very differently. It is something like for any corporate planning there is short term planning and a long term planning. So there are some things you have to look at it from short term planning.\n\nYou have to get these things done during this quarter, but then you also have to look at it on a long term basis what will be in next 10 years. So Bhagavan says that right now we are looking at the world from a very short narrow perspective which is limited to this life. But this life is not the end by itself. This life is nothing but just a fraction of your own existence. So he starts with saying, you are worrying about these people. They are not worth worrying about.\n\nNo relatives of yours or friend of yours you should worry about whether he is dead or alive. It was a very shocking declaration to Arjuna, why shouldn't I be worrying about my own kith and kin? When you look at it from this narrow perspective, it will seem that something is good or bad. But we have learned that good and bad is a relative perspective. So what is maybe good in a short term may not be good in a long term. That's why we have come across two terms.\n\nPrayas is pleasant temporarily. Shreyas is good forever. That which is always good is Shreyas. That which is temporarily pleasant is Prayas. So the situation I see may be pleasant for now -- from Arjuna's point of view, running away from this battle is pleasant. Less things to worry about, but it's not pleasant in the long run.\n\nYou can allow these criminals to continue doing their crimes and this non Aryan like behavior, as Krishna puts it, the way these people are behaving is not fit to be an Aryan. Therefore to establish Dharma of Arya Bhart, it is your duty as the Kshatriya to fight this war. That's basically Krishna's message here. So he said, you shouldn't be worrying about them. But then he starts from the widest perspective saying the existence for any being is eternal. We are eternal beings.\n\nThere was never a time where you were not there, or I was not there, or these kings were not there. So we are all eternal beings, immortal beings. We consider ourselves to be mortal. So that's basically the paradigm shift for Arjuna and all of us. How to look at our life. There will be a narrow perspective.\n\nThere is a relative reality. When there is a ice cube in my glass, it has this relative reality. The ice cube is very solid. But if I wait long enough, that ice cube will be gone. There will be just water. Water relatively has a longer existence than ice cube.\n\nIce cube is a very short term existence. I, as an intelligent being who use ice before, I know that that if I really want to use this ice, I have to use it as quickly as possible. Otherwise the ice will go away. There won't be any ice. So if I want to say you have to look at this situation from a wider perspective, that these people cannot be killed. And therefore he said, just as they have progressed from one existence to another, you have progressed one existence to another in your life.\n\nFrom a childhood to adulthood and to old age, you will also migrate to the new state of existence. Deha Antara -- transferring from one body to another -- will not be any different from your migration from childhood to adulthood. Therefore, wise person who has understood this fundamental truth will not get confused. One who has understood the widest perspective of existence, he will not be worried about a small change in existence. When you understand water and ice, and the ice becomes water, you don't get upset.\n\nMaybe you have to put it back into the freezer if you want more ice in the ice cube tray. So we know that the existence is permanent. Bhagavan says, but there may be a temporary consequences of me dealing with this world. Those experiences in my life create Sukha and Dukha. Matraha Sparsaha Tu Kaunteya -- When sense organs come in contact with sense objects, it will create an experience.\n\nThat experience, depending on the qualities of your sense organs, will be either pleasant or unpleasant. One experience which is pleasant to me may be unpleasant to somebody else. Jumping from 50ft on a bungee jumping is pleasant to somebody. It will not be pleasant for me. Same experience can give two different experiences to two different people in the same set of circumstances. Depending on his own equipment, depending on my mind if it is rainy outside it may be unpleasant.\n\nBut if I'm a farmer or a gardener, it may be a pleasant experience. The bhagawan said, matrahas parsaha tu kunteya sita ushna sukh dukadah. They give these experiences of sukhendukha. They are nothing but perceptions of your mind. And therefore he said, taam titiksha bharad. You have no other choice.\n\nWhether it's pleasant or unpleasant, you must bear them. Know that they are temporary. They have beginning and an end. And therefore, even a pleasant experience -- don't get too excited or too elated, because it will also come to an end. Every other day we hear about recession and then the next day we hear about no, no, the market is going to keep going.\n\nHow long? We know for sure there will be a recession sometime. We just hope it will not be before I retire, that's all. So every experience has a beginning and end. While we are experiencing, if we remember that, that this is a temporary experience, we will not get too invested in that experience. We get too invested in their experience. That's where we get either too excited or elated or too depressed.\n\nThe right way to live is to bear them all -- pleasant and unpleasant. And then Bhagavan now defines what is the nature of the self. So other day I also had a new revelation about the ownership of this building. So my condo administrator came to me as a Krishna to explain to me what I own and what I don't own. We obviously all of you know that Meena and I own this building. So we always say, well, we own this building.\n\nEverything outside parking lot is common area. We own this building. There was clear understanding the last about 14 years we owned this building or 16 years we owned this building. The other day we had a water damage. Hot water heater broke and it was just spraying out water all over the bathroom. So I had to obviously call.\n\nI actually called fire department because I didn't know what to do. By the time fire department came, the guy who was cleaning the carpet, he figured out there is a shut off valve outside. He shut it off, everything was fine. But when I reported it to our condo guy, he said, well, I'll come down Neil and check it out whether there's any damage in the attic. He walked through my attic. He found that we were storing old drawings and files in our attic.\n\nWe have storage trusses. He said, Neil, I don't want to be a pain in your neck, but you're not supposed to store anything in an attic. He said, why is that? He said, because you only own building from your ceiling to the top of the floor. The attic does not belong to you. I said, who owns the attic? He said, the condo association.\n\nI said, are you serious? They say, yeah, yeah, you only own from the ceiling to the floor. They said, what about below the floor? He said, that also condo association. He said, what about outside? He said, you only went from the inside face of your exterior wall to the other side interior face of exterior wall.\n\nI said, who owns the exterior walls? The condo association. So I said, who owns the building? He said, Neil, you own the space within the exterior walls, the ceiling, and the floor. I said, so nothing concrete which I can call a building is mine? He said, no, none of that is yours.\n\nYou as a condo owner only own the space. Do you mean to say the condo association tomorrow can decide that they want to take the roof away because they own the roof and then they take the four walls away? Yeah, technically they own. Now, how about the ground below? They own the ground below too. All you own is space within four walls, floor and a ceiling.\n\nThey say, okay, you try to remove that. I'll tell you, demarcate my space from outside space, inside space, because my condo is just the space. You can remove floors, wall and ceiling as condo owner association. You won't be able to take this space away because I own this space. Now, that's a completely different way to look at this condo ownership. First of all, the bank has the mortgage on this space, so I owe them money. And when I want to sell something, I only own the space. There is nothing tangible which I can say I own outright. But technically, free and clear, what I own is just the space inside this building. Even though it has no value by itself -- without the walls, floor and ceiling, the space has no practical meaning. The space is defining the value of the conditioning, but the conditionings are defining the limitations of the space.\n\nBhagavan said to Arjuna that you have to start looking at your relationship to your teacher and your grandfather in a very different way. And therefore he says, avinasi tu tadviddhi en sarvam idam tatham. So what is my relationship with that self which is residing in all these beings? If all these beings are immortal, but they can get killed. What is getting killed and what is immortal? So Bhagavan now defines the relationship between the perishable and imperishable.\n\nThe Imperishable is the one which is the essence of any being. Any being is called a being as long as the consciousness is functioning through him. I am who I am as long as I'm alive. Without that consciousness, it is nothing but a dead body. The dead body is not Neil Bhatt. But he said that which you call your relative Bhishma and Drona.\n\nThat essence is Avinashi. It cannot be destroyed. Tadvidi, know that the essence of a being with whom you have a relationship with is indestructible. It is not limited to that person. This is a complete paradigm shift for most of us who have never thought about it. I have always thought that my self is residing in me and your self is residing in you and herself is residing in her.\n\nThey're all kind of nice little packages of selves, you know. And we are interacting with each other. That which makes your friend your friend is actually indestructible. Your cousin, your cousin is indestructible. Your teacher, teacher indestructible. But that essence is not limited to him.\n\nEverything is pervaded by that essence which you call yourself, which you call your friend's self, which you call grandfather's self. Anything that you can think of, anything they can perceive. Your world perception may be as grand as the entire universe. Anything that you can think of in a sarvam idam tatham, it is all pervaded by that self.",
      "reflection": "These verses contain one of the Gita's most essential teachings: \"That which is not, shall never be; that which is, shall never cease to be.\" This distinguishes between the Real (Sat) and the Unreal (Asat). The Real is that which exists in all three periods of time - past, present, and future - without any change. The Unreal is that which appears to exist but has no permanent reality, like a snake seen in a rope or ice that melts into water. The body and all material forms belong to this changing, temporary reality.\n\nVerse 17 declares: \"The Spirit, which pervades all that we see, is imperishable. Nothing can destroy the Spirit.\" This all-pervading Spirit is not limited to your body or mine - it is the same consciousness expressing through all beings, like electricity manifesting as light, heat, and sound through different appliances. Therefore, Krishna concludes in verse 18: \"The material bodies which this Eternal, Indestructible, Immeasurable Spirit inhabits are all finite. Therefore fight, O Valiant Man!\"\n\nApply this teaching today by examining what you consider \"real\" in your life. Your possessions, relationships, status, body - which of these will exist unchanged forever? Now consider: What remains constant through all the changes of your life? That unchanging awareness is your true Self. When you feel threatened or anxious, ask: \"Is it the Real or the Unreal that is threatened?\" The Real cannot be harmed; the Unreal was never truly yours to lose. How does this shift your perspective on what you fear losing?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 2, Sankhya Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge. And as we have seen, this is a self unfoldment for the one who has not understood himself. Arjuna has not realized the reality of his own self. Therefore all this confusion. So rather than just giving him a temporary advice of what is right at this time, help to dispel his myth about the nature of the self and give him the right knowledge. So the verse 11 onwards, we had been discussing the nature of this self.\n\nAnd the first thing we have heard from Bhagavan is that the self which you and I considered mortal is actually immortal. That the first declaration very bold. We don't find it very bold because we grew up with it. It was somewhat embedded in our psyche. However, if you imagine your own experiences of your life and your own viewpoint towards life, it's extremely revealing. It is completely different than all my experiences so far.\n\nAll my life I consider this life to be mortal. Therefore there's fear of death. And now Bhagavan says this life is immortal. Your self which considers you as you. That which makes me feel I. That feeling I, which is not related to this body, not this mind, not this intellect.\n\nTherefore I always say my body, my mind, my intellect, that entity he calls this mind is, Bhagavan says eternal is imperishable. That's the first declaration. The second, as we have seen, is the explanation of what this mortal life is all about. How does it relate to that immortality? He said the immortal self keeps taking different states of existence as the embodied one. Just as within this body there are changes occurring, when this body becomes no longer useful for that embodied one, he moves on to find another body. That change is no different than my growing from baby to young man to old man and then dying.\n\nSo the idea or the concept of reincarnation is introduced right away in the second verse of that discourse. Now this is something we do find very controversial. Swamiji used to say, \"One thing good about my profession is I can bluff all my life and never have to prove anything, and nobody can catch me.\" That's because this is nothing you can prove objectively -- it is a subjective science. Subjectively, it can be proved. All our sages and all the prophets of the world have time and again confirmed the nature of this self.\n\nBut it cannot be transferred that knowledge to you in an objective manner. Therefore it is called self unfoldment. Therefore it can only be prescribed how to feel it, how to experience it. If I had been to Hawaii and I can give you all kind of explanation, I can write all kind of essays. But the only way will experience it when you yourself go to Hawaii. So therefore this knowledge can only be experienced.\n\nSo the concept of reincarnation can only be inferred by our experiences and cannot be experienced or proven objectively in the scientific sense. And as we had discussed, all of us do come into this world with very different backgrounds, situations and circumstances. And if Bhagavan was all compassionate and equal to all of us, he probably would have created a standard situation for all of us to come in -- same set of parents, same situation, everybody given the same amount of money upfront, and now go do whatever you need to do. But that does not happen.\n\nThat does suggest that we may have been carrying some baggage from before we started this journey. I may be carrying some abilities before I started this journey. So it neatly ties together the observations we have in this world -- different people having different abilities right from birth, different tendencies -- suggesting that they must have had different experiences prior to this existence. So the diversity of situations for all the newly born in this world is somewhat explained by this concept of reincarnation.\n\nThe third question is: why do I then feel this sorrow and happiness in this world? If my self is immortal, why am I not experiencing it?\n\nAnd it is explained by Matraha Sparsha Tu Kaunteya -- the senses, when they come in contact with sense objects, depending on the sensitivity of the senses, make me feel either pain or pleasure. All these experiences, whether painful or pleasurable, are time-bound and finite. Therefore, you bear them or enjoy them, but know that they are going to pass. So that explains our situation and how to deal with this life. And then Bhagavan came to the conclusion: Naasato Vidyate Bhavaha.\n\nThat which is unreal has no existence. It may be the figment of my imagination. In my perception there is an existence a snake which I am seeing in a rope. In a classical example, snake does have real existence for the one who is seeing the snake. But in reality the snake has no existence. Because it is asat before my delusion and after my delusion is over.\n\nThat snake has no existence. Therefore it is asat that is impermanent. No real existence, but a perceived existence that has no real existence. There is no being for the unreal to come into existence. And for the real there is no non existence. The real, which is myself, has no question of non existence.\n\nTherefore I say, there was never a time when this king were not there or you were not there. That I in I and you in you and he in him and see in her always existed will exist. Bhagavan said in a different form. Gold continues to exist; the form continues to change. The form of a gold bar is temporary.\n\nAt the whim of the owner or the whim of the artist, the goldsmith, that will change and that is impermanent and. And therefore it does not have a real existence. What is real is the gold existence. So we learned that that which is real never cease to exist. That which is unreal truly have no existence other than in my perception. This room space truly has no existence other than its own conditioning.\n\nThere is nothing called room space really exist here other than the space exists here. But I create room space in my perception because of the walls, floor and ceiling. The mortality is for this walls, floor and ceiling. I can remove them anytime I want as an owner. Or somebody may decide to destroy it for other reason. But that can never change the nature of the space within this space was here, is here and will be here.\n\nSo for the space's perspective, there is no mortality from the conditioning perspective. It never really had any real existence other than a relative reality. So therefore, Bhagavan says, avinasi tu tadviddhi iena sarvam idam tatam by which this entire Jagat is pervaded. There is existence everywhere. I exist, you exist, she exists, he exists, chair exists, tree exists. So everything where we see, we consider it in existence.\n\nThat existence in its purity is all pervading. Everywhere I see there is some existence of something that all pervading existence. Bhagavan says Avinashi is indestructible. A form of an existence can be destroyed. Existence itself cannot be destroyed. A table can be destroyed, but the material of the table will remain in some form.\n\nCraig is trying to make a table out of now. The table does not exist right now other than his imagination. But the wood does exist because he said, I have this. I Will buy this and do that that would exist. Table only exist in his imagination. But with his imagination he can bring the form into existence.\n\nAnd it will exist as long as its time is. And then somebody will say, this is not good enough and it will be destroyed. So the form has the mortality, not the existence itself. Know that the all pervading self which makes all the existence possible is indestructible. That also does not exclude you and I. You and I are part of this ever existing, all pervading being.\n\nAnd we have in detail, seen in self unfoldment and thought about. This body is nothing but the food modified. It was something else. It became food for me, it became my body. It will become food for some other entities, creatures, worms, whatever, or fertilizer. Because Hindus get cremated.\n\nSo it will be fertilized. Vinasam avya yasyasya nakastyan kartum arhati. There is none who is capable of destroying this imperishable self. No matter how much force I can apply to this building. I can have bulldozers, I can destroy this building, but cannot destroy the space. Space was here, is and will be here.\n\nNone has any capability to destroy this space. Because this space is all pervading, ever pervading. No one has any capability to destroy the space. The self in me, Bhagavan said, is similarly imperishable. And therefore no one has the capability to destroy that. So if you consider I can destroy somebody's self, you are mistaken.\n\nOr somebody thinks they can destroy myself, they are mistaken. Therefore, Gandhiji said, you probably can destroy my body, but you will never be able to win over my soul. Somebody can kill you, but you cannot kill the self in you, the ideals in you. The message which you leave behind. Nityasya uktaha sharirnaha. So what is destructible?\n\nThese bodies of this embodied one is destructible as an end. This conditioning of this unconditioned space is destructible. Space which is all pervading, ever existing, remaining as is. But it has taken up this conditioning, this conditioning which I see as room space is destructible. And it has its own end. It is own beginning and own end.\n\nTherefore, there is a little plaque in every office building or new commercial building. Say create and such, such and such occupancy, such and such. It says when it was created it does not have a death date. But we know for sure that this building will not be here 500 years from now mortgage companies have figured out the life of your building, typically 30 years. Therefore they give you 30 year mortgage. Because average life of a building in this country we consider 30 years.\n\nSo by the time you depreciate the building at the end of 30 years, the value is zero. Now I have to reconstruct what we call it is a adaptive reuse. And we spent as much money, not as much, probably more money than it took them to build that building and just completely change it into something new warehouse before. Now I'm creating office building into it. But it will never exist in the same fashion forever. It continues to change.\n\nFor that imperishable one's bodies has end. This conditioning of the room we have said is room, walls, floor and ceiling. In my case it is my body, mind and intellect. They have end but not the self. Those are the conditioning taken upon by the imperishable self. Anasi Nah or pramayashya.\n\nBut that entity which you consider yourself, I consider myself. And he, she herself is Anashinaha indestructible, a prameyashya also incomprehensible. That's the problem we have. We just cannot comprehend the self without its conditioning. Imagining a space without conditioning is impossible. No architect can imagine or no designer can imagine a space.\n\nSo for me to consider a space, I have to create conditioning in my mind. Therefore, even to conceive the space outside, I can only imagine it in reference to something -- the building across the parking lot, the trees, the sky. Space itself cannot be grasped by the mind without some conditioning.",
      "reflection": "These verses deliver a startling truth: \"He who thinks that the Spirit kills, and he who thinks of It as killed, are both ignorant. The Spirit kills not, nor is It killed.\" This challenges our fundamental assumptions about death and violence. The eternal Self cannot be the doer of any action, including killing, nor can it be the recipient of any action, including being killed. Actions happen at the level of body-mind-intellect, not at the level of the true Self.\n\nVerse 20 is one of the most quoted descriptions of the Self: \"It was not born; It will never die, nor once having been, can It cease to be. Unborn, Eternal, Ever-enduring, yet Most Ancient, the Spirit dies not when the body is dead.\" Notice the paradox: the Self is both \"eternal\" and \"most ancient\" - it transcends time altogether. And verse 21 poses the logical question: \"He who knows the Spirit as Indestructible, Immortal, Unborn, Always-the-Same, how should he kill or cause to be killed?\"\n\nToday, contemplate this: If your true Self was never born and will never die, what exactly do you fear when you fear death? The body will certainly perish - but that is not you. The mind will dissolve - but that is not you either. Try this exercise: imagine yourself as the space within a room. The walls can be painted, damaged, or demolished, but the space itself is untouched. You are like that space - forms come and go within you, but you remain unchanged. How does identifying with this unchanging Self rather than the changing body-mind alter your relationship with mortality?"

So Bhagavad Gita is putting this knowledge in an understandable manner for us. Something which cannot be explained, inexplicable, the nature of the true self. Bhagavan is making an effort for us to understand.\n\nSo so far we have understood from Bhagavan that the self is imperishable, immutable and immortal. And it is all pervading. So myself and yourself are not two different selves. The same self expressing through different bodies, different instruments. Just like Swamiji uses the classic analogy of electricity. Electricity is one, its manifestations are many.\n\nSo in this building right now we see electricity, light, also see the heat from our heater. Both are only expressed in the same energy which is electricity. So you and I are different people, but we are the manifestation of the same entity which I call myself and you call yourself. So we had been discussing this verses where Bhagavan gave us several analogies for us to understand. One of them says: just as in this body we grow from baby to child to young adult to adult and then to an old man, when this self changes this body, it will still be the same kind of change.\n\nIt is no different than the change which you encountered effortlessly. I grew effortlessly from young adult to adult into an old man. And to make us understand, we have seen Vaasansi Jirinani ya tha Vihaan. So why do I change this body? He said, because this body is no longer appropriate to fulfill my Vasanathan desires. If my goal is to go from here to D.C. but if my car is not good enough, I have to buy another car or change another car, borrow, rent another car, which is more appropriate for that.\n\nSo because now this body is getting old and non functional that I change the body. Bhagavan has explained the concept of transmigration. Why person goes from one body to another which we have seen in the last verse which is vasansi ji yathavi haya navani gruhanati naroparani tatha sari raani vihaaya jirinani annyani sanyati navani dhi. It is as simple as that. Because this body is old. Just as when the old clothes are no longer useful, I buy new clothes, I change into new clothes.\n\nWhen this body is no longer useful or not appropriate, I move on to the next one. Then coming back to explaining the nature of the self. The next two verses describe the self in a manner which we can understand. Swamiji explains here that something which is inexplicable can only be explained in terms of what is explainable. There is a word in Sanskrit: Upadesha. Upadesha literally means \"near place\" -- a place near to what I am trying to indicate. Because I cannot transmit my knowledge into your mind or intellect. But I can point out and then you will understand yourself to make it your own knowledge. So if I had been to Hawaii and you have never been to Hawaii, and I have to explain to you what Hawaii feels like or looks like, all I can do is compare it to a place which you have been to. So I might say, \"Have you been to the Bahamas? Yes? Well, Hawaii is something like the Bahamas.\" So I can only explain things which you have not experienced by using the parameters of what you already know. So Bhagavan here now explains the nature of the self using examples which we understand. The verse says: Na Enam Chindanti Sastrani, Nainam Dahati Pavakaha, Na Chainam Kledayantyapah, Na Shoshayati Marutah.\n\nEverything in this world I see is destructible. There is nothing that I know which does not get destructed. The destruction is the nature of this world. But the destruction can occur in various ways depending on the nature of that thing or being. So things which are grosser can be destroyed by grosser instruments. Nayanam chindanti sastrani Sastrani Weapons or any kind of instrument which can cut axe or a sword which can cut something.\n\nBut sword can only cut something which is as gross or more grosser than the sword. It cannot cut something which is subtler than the sword. So sword can cut object which is Solid, it cannot cut water which is liquid. Because water is subtler than sword itself. Therefore sword cannot cut it. So the implication is the self is subtler than any solid material you see in this world.\n\nTherefore it cannot be cut by weapons. Nayanam Chandanti Sastrani na enam Dahati Pavakaha Fire cannot burn it. Fire can burn everything, but it cannot burn space. Space is subtler than fire and therefore fire cannot burn space. So in the world of manifestation Prakriti we see the five great elements. The earth the grossest and space is the subtlest of all.\n\nSo as the things get subtler, the grosser material cannot affect it. Nayanam Dhati Pavakah so the fire can burn everything, but not something which is subtler than fire. Therefore the self must be subtler than fire. Na chanam kle dian ti apah Water cannot wet it. Water can only wet something which has space in its structure -- interstitial space. Cotton can get soaked because between cotton fibers there is space in between. If there is no space, water cannot wet it.\n\nSteel, it cannot soak that. So it is even subtler than water and wind cannot dry it. The dehydration only occurs if there is a moisture available in that object. Our body can get dehydrated because we know it is what 80% water. If there is no water in it, it cannot be dried. Water is only there if there is an interstitial space in between the structure.\n\nThe point is: something which is subtler than the instrument of destruction cannot be destroyed by that instrument. So all the things which we know in this world are basically destructible because they're grosser than the instruments that can destroy them. Including my mind and intellect. This body get destroyed because it is gross body. It is made up of five elements. So all elements go back to where they come from.\n\nThink of it this way: we borrow a book from the library. At some point we have to return it. It does not belong to me. I just borrowed it from the library. Same with elements which make my body, mind and intellect are borrowed from Prakriti. Therefore I have to return them when I'm done with it.\n\nThe next verse defines this self as Acchedya. So now we have understood: because it cannot be cut, it must be non-cuttable. It cannot be burnt; it's non-wettable; it is non-dryable. And therefore because it cannot be destroyed by any means that we have known. The conclusion is Nityaha permanent. Something which has no destruction has to be permanent.\n\nIf something is permanent and indestructible, that means it is subtler than all means of destruction. And if it is subtler than any means of destruction that I know, it has to be all pervading. Therefore it is sarvagataha, all pervading. All pervading literally means it is subtler than anything I can comprehend through my senses. Everything which I can comprehend is finite.\n\nEverything that is finite has its own self, life. But something which is permanent has to be beyond my sense perception. And therefore it is all pervad. If it's all pervading, it has to be firm because there is no place to move. If I am all pervading in my chair, then I cannot move. But if I am sitting on a bench and I am the only one, I can move around on that bench.\n\nSthanu also can be movable -- a tree is stable at the base, but it's moving at the top. Many people do not know that high-rise buildings also move in the wind. When I first started designing high rise buildings, I come to realize that the movement can be as much as several feet. Buildings which are hundred and something stories, so people get seasickness.\n\nSome people are very sensitive to movement. Most of us do not notice it, but those who are sensitive to movement feel seasickness because the building literally moves in wind. So when we design it, we have to make sure all parts are basically movable. So all the windows and all that which you see. But from my perspective, the building is stable because my perception doesn't go as far.\n\nThe building is stable at the base but moving at the top. Therefore, the next verse says Achalah -- not only stable, but unmovable, simply because there is no place for it to move. If I'm all pervading, there is no other thing that can exist. So right now, only thing which I can think of, all space, is all pervading. Out of the five great elements I see, the other four are relatively finite. Matter has its own limitations.\n\nThe fire has its own limitations. Air has its own limitations. Water has own limitations. Space is all pervading. From my perspective right now, wherever I think there is space, therefore I can move the parts of this building. Now, these days, with the historical preservation, they sometimes insist that you cannot destroy this building.\n\nBut then some developer wants to buy that land because of great value. Then they will come in and say, we will take this building and put it somewhere else. We can take the whole building from the foundation up, put it in another county, another country. Even so, space does not move. When the building moves, space does not move. I can move my car from one place to another, but the space within the car does not move simply because space is unmovable.\n\nIf space is everywhere, there is no place to go. But everything else moves in the space where space is the subtlest of all the elements of Prakriti. The self is even subtler than the space, all five elements. Therefore it has no place to go. Therefore it is achalam, Sanatanah, eternal or ancient. Sanatana means it's not something new, it's not something new that we have invented.\n\nIf it were something new, a new concept that we have figured out, then there will be another time when somebody will make it not valid. New research will occur -- so for a while they say coffee drinking is not good. Then they came back and said, no, coffee is actually good for you. If you drink at least X number of cups of coffee, then you don't get Alzheimer or at least your brain will function well. That was a great solace to me. Okay, okay, I'm with.\n\nSo it keeps changing. If there's something new, it has all probability of getting invalid. But he says it's a Sanata. It's ancient, it's eternal. Before the time that you can think of, anything you can think of in past, it is beyond that. Therefore it's sanatanah.\n\nIt is unmanifest, Achintya -- it cannot be thought of. It cannot be grasped by my thinking instrument. So everything I try to understand, everything I comprehend in this world is actually by my intellect to understand it. When it comes in my comprehension, it has limitations. Everything I can comprehend is finite.\n\nI can think of elephant, I can think of buildings. All that I can think is finite because they are manifest. The self is unmanifest. Manifest is something I can perceive through my senses.",
      "reflection": "The famous \"garment\" analogy in verse 22 makes the abstract teaching tangible: \"As a man discards his threadbare robes and puts on new, so the Spirit throws off Its worn-out bodies and takes fresh ones.\" We change clothes without any sense of losing our identity - the new shirt is simply more appropriate for our current needs. Similarly, the Self changes bodies when the old one can no longer serve its purpose. This reframing transforms death from a terrifying end into a natural transition.\n\nVerses 23-24 describe the Self's indestructibility using the five elements: \"Weapons cleave It not, fire burns It not, water drenches It not, and wind dries It not.\" Weapons can only cut something grosser than themselves - they cannot cut water. Fire can only burn something less subtle than itself - it cannot burn space. The Self is subtler than the subtlest element, hence nothing in the material world can affect it. It is \"Eternal, All-pervading, Unchanging, Immovable and Most Ancient.\"\n\nPractice this contemplation today: When you change your clothes, pause and notice - did \"you\" change? When you cut your hair or nails, did the essential \"you\" diminish? Now extend this: when your body ages and changes, when cells die and are replaced, when moods shift and thoughts come and go - what remains constant through all these changes? That constant witness is what these verses point to. Spend a few moments simply being aware of being aware - this pure awareness is what cannot be cut, burned, wetted, or dried."

Why person goes from one body to another which we have seen in the last verse which is vasansi ji yathavi haya navani gruhanati naroparani tatha sari raani vihaaya jirinani annyani sanyati navani dhi. It is as simple as that. Because this body is old. Just as when the old clothes are no longer useful, I buy new clothes, I change into new clothes.\n\nWhen this body is no longer useful or not appropriate, I move on to the next one.

Well, Hawaii is something like the Bahamas.\" So I can only explain things which you have not experienced by using the parameters of what you already know.

It cannot cut something which is subtler than the sword. So sword can cut object which is Solid, it cannot cut water which is liquid. Because water is subtler than sword itself. Therefore sword cannot cut it. So the implication is the self is subtler than any solid material you see in this world.\n\nTherefore it cannot be cut by weapons. Nayanam Chandanti Sastrani na enam Dahati Pavakaha Fire cannot burn it. Fire can burn everything, but it cannot burn space. Space is subtler than fire and therefore fire cannot burn space. So in the world of manifestation Prakriti we see the five great elements.

      "reflection": "These verses complete Krishna's philosophical argument by addressing both the spiritual and practical perspectives. Verse 25 declares the Self to be \"Unmanifest, Unthinkable, Immutable\" - beyond the reach of our senses and even our thinking mind. \"Wherefore, knowing the Spirit as such, thou hast no cause to grieve.\" The Self cannot be objectified or known as an object of knowledge; it is the very subject that makes all knowing possible.\n\nBut Krishna also addresses those who may not accept the immortality of the Self. Verse 26 says: \"Even if thou thinkest of It as constantly being born, constantly dying, even then... thou still hast no cause to grieve.\" And verse 27 delivers the practical truth everyone must accept: \"For death is as sure for that which is born, as birth is for that which is dead. Therefore grieve not for what is inevitable.\" Whether you believe in an eternal soul or not, grieving over what is certain and unavoidable is futile.\n\nThis teaching offers a powerful practice: Identify what you are currently grieving over or anxious about. Ask yourself: \"Is this within my control, or is it inevitable?\" If it is inevitable - like aging, change, or eventual death - then grieving is a waste of precious life energy. If it is within your control, then take action instead of worrying. The Stoics later echoed this wisdom: concern yourself only with what is in your power. Today, sort your worries into these two categories and release those that belong to the inevitable."

      "commentary": "We have completed discussion on Chapter 1, Arjuna Vishadha Yoga, in which we have seen our conditions in this world. Arjuna Vishada Yoga represents our life where we are trained all our life for something. We have certain ideals and certain duties which we have held very dear to us. This is the very goal of my life. But then sometimes the situation overwhelms us, which makes us confused about what is right and what is wrong. And at that point our mind starts giving us wrong indications of what is right and what is wrong.\n\nAnd we come up with all kinds of arguments about why I shouldn't be doing my duty, why I shouldn't be doing what I thought all this time that this is right for me. And these arguments are sometimes so convincing that we convince ourselves, saying \"this is the voice of my antaratma, my inner conscience.\" However, it is just the blabbering of my mind, because I have not really established myself in my own true self. So this is not advice from Krishna, the consciousness in me, but rather my mind coming up with a defensive mechanism for why I shouldn't be doing this -- just because I'm overwhelmed by the situation.\n\nSo we have seen in the last few verses of chapter one, Arjuna put forth a very brilliant argument about why he shouldn't be fighting this war. First he says, from my personal point of view, I shouldn't be fighting this war. To kill my own kith and kin looks very logical -- why should you be killing your kith and kin? When that argument didn't seem to be convincing Krishna, because he didn't have an approving reaction, Arjuna realized -- well, those kith and kin are standing right in front of you to kill you. So that didn't seem like a very logical argument, he goes to the next level and says the war itself is very evil.\n\nAny war is evil because in war men will die -- many men will die, which is obvious. And therefore it will upset the entire equilibrium of society by destroying family units. When a man dies in the family, obviously the family loses the head of the household. Now the women will be unprotected. And when the women become unprotected, they will do things which are not according to their dharma, because they have no protection. And when that happens, the whole system will be out of balance, giving rise to Varna Sankara -- intermixing of social classes -- in the next generation.\n\nAnd that will completely upset our system, where the lineage of a father to the son in the same tradition will be giving oblation to the Pitrus. So the whole system will be completely destroyed according to Arjuna. Again, this makes a lot of sense, that war is evil. Everyone knows war is not something which is to look forward to, but war is inevitable sometimes to protect the society, protect the dharma. So Arjuna makes all the arguments he thinks he can make against fighting this war, and then he sits down in his chariot.\n\nIn the last verse, which we have seen, Sanjaya described that after making his argument, Arjuna didn't see any reaction from Krishna, so he drops down and throws his weapons away. That means he does not even have a mental capacity to hang on to himself. So the next chapter which we are entering into, called Sankhya Yoga, the Yoga of Knowledge. Yoga of Knowledge, in the line of the knowledge of the Sankhyas. As Swamiji describes in his commentary, in our system there are six schools of thought, six different lines of philosophy, each one taking a slightly different route from the others. Sankhya is one of them. Sankhya is supposed to be the most logical thought, almost as scientific as the modern sciences.\n\nIt's a very logical approach to what is reality, what is truth, what is my essence, and what is the ultimate reality. It takes a very logical approach, and as we have seen in Logic of Spirituality, it takes you through who am I and what is my self. Then where did I come from? Where we have seen anything which we see is an effect of a cause. When I see a book here, it's an effect. The cause is somebody who knew how to write the book, how to print the book, and how to put it together.\n\nThe book is in front of me. So there are causes to cause any reality. I exist, I'm an effect. There are causes which cause me to be in this effect. Those causes are broadly defined as an efficient cause and a material cause. Someone who knew how to create me in this effect.\n\nAnd someone also had the material to create me. Someone who knew how to create this book and someone also the material to create this book. So the knowledge is called efficient cause and the material is called material cause. These two have to come together for any effect to come into existence. And we can trace back all of that. And who had this efficient cause and material cause, both of them, to create this universe and me.\n\nAnd we trace it back to one entity who had the knowledge to create this universe and also had the material to create it. The efficient cause we call God -- God has the knowledge to create this universe, including my own self. He also had the material to create this universe and myself. Then where did that material come from? At the end of our inquiry, we come to the conclusion that the material could not have come from anywhere else but from His own self, because nothing else existed before this universe was created -- only that one singularity which we call God. And that God had the knowledge.\n\nThe only material available to him was his own self. So out of his own self is created this universe. So my own self also cannot have come other than from his own self. So myself and his self is one and the same. My self is nothing but the reflection of his self. Thus logically concluding that Myself cannot be separate from his self because his self is immortal, imperishable, Myself also cannot be perishable or mortal.\n\nThat is the philosophy of Sankhya. Now, the Sankhya philosophy here is not put together verbatim, but its flavor and essence were taken here by Bhagavan Vedvyasa, also called Badarayana, in the Uttar Mimamsa school of thought -- which is theistic, as Swamiji says -- which accepts the reality of the one eternal self called Brahman, and also accepts the reality of this world and its relationship to Brahman.\n\nThus, in Bhagavad Gita from Chapter 2 onward, we will see the synthesis of all three paths of realization explained in the Vedas: Bhakti Yoga (path of devotion), Karma Yoga (path of action), and Jnana Yoga (path of knowledge). Bhagavad Gita puts all three yogas together as a comprehensive path of realization. It's Pravritti Vada -- you have to actively engage in this world, and then achieve the ultimate happiness you're seeking, with freedom from all the bondages and limitations you have superimposed on yourself. So in this second chapter, the teaching begins with Sanjaya's assessment of what's happening there.\n\nChapter 2, verse 1 says Sanjaya Vacha tam tatha krupaya vistam asrupurna kulekshanam Vishidantam Idam Vakyam Uvacha Madhusudhana, Madhusudana Krishna. And we have seen the Madhusudana one who is the slayer of the demon Madhu. In the Puranic story, these are all demons Krishna has slain. But philosophically, the demon Madhu represents that which seems very sweet to me in life but is not good for me -- that which is Preyas but not Shreyas, that which seems pleasant but is not truly good. Madhusudana is the slayer of that. When my intellect is awakened, I realize this may seem good to me, but is not good for me.\n\nSo Lord Krishna, Madhusudana, said this to the one who was completely overwhelmed by pity and despondency, his eyes full of tears, agitated. Arjuna had presented his case for why he shouldn't be fighting, and he was obviously expecting that Krishna would say, \"Well, let's not fight this war.\" But the reaction that came in the next two verses is completely shocking to Arjuna. Sri Bhagavan Uvacha -- the second verse, the first time Bhagavan speaks in this Gita: Kutastva Kasmalam Idam Vishame Samupasthitam, Anarya Jushtam Asvargyam Akirtikaram Arjuna. O Arjuna, where does this weakness of heart come upon you?\n\nWhich is Anari Jistham only practiced by those who are not civilized like you. Because Arya is the civilized one, Anaria is the uncivilized one according to their social order. One who is not civilized, who does not know the value of dharma, value of performing his own duties. Once a duty is assigned to me, I have assigned myself as taking upon that role, then it becomes imperative that I perform that duty. Once I decide that I want to be a husband, all the duties of husbands are now superimposed on my and as long as I want to be a husband, I have to perform all those duties that the civilized man's law. Once I decide I want to be a father, all the fatherly duties are assigned to me and there is no escape for me to perform those duties.\n\nThat's a civilized way of living. So once I have decided I'm going to be the general of this army, the leader of this society, then all the duties assigned to me as the leader of this army and leader of this society, I have to perform those duties. Now when I'm trying to shirk away from those duties. That is Anaria jistham. Only those who are not civilized will do that. They will be those deadbeat dads.\n\nThey are not civilized. They do not know that their duty is to pay whatever the alimony for their children. So only the uncivilized one will do that. So Bhagavan said, where does this Anaria jistham, weakness of your heart, which is not allowing you to do your duty, come upon you, which is a kirtikaram? It's not going to give you a good name. You may have all the good arguments to not do your duties, but once you don't do your duties, it's not going to give you a good name, not going to make you famous.\n\nThat how he ran away from his duties, you know, and this is because of the weakness of your heart. When you were thinking correctly, you knew what your duty is because you are the leader of this army and you knew what to do is to fight the enemy which is standing in front of you. You have not asked for this war. You didn't decide that this is the right thing to do. But the others in in their evil thoughts have decided to fight this war. Now it is your duty to lead your army into this war.\n\nSo this is not something Krishna approves of -- running away from your duty. Therefore, in the next verse he says: this is what you should be doing. \"Get up, O Parantapa!\" -- which is another name for Arjuna, meaning \"scorcher of the foes\" -- reminding him that his enemies are afraid of him. His training and achievement in life have been such that enemies tremble to stand in front of him.",
      "reflection": "Verse 28 presents a humbling truth: \"The end and the beginning of beings are unknown. We see only the intervening formations. Then what cause is there for grief?\" We witness only the middle portion of existence - a being's appearance in this world - without knowing where it came from before birth or where it goes after death. Our grief arises from the illusion that this visible portion is all there is.\n\nVerse 29 acknowledges the rarity and wonder of this knowledge: \"One hears of the Spirit with surprise, another thinks It marvellous, the third listens without comprehending. Thus, though many are told about It, scarcely is there one who knows It.\" This is not discouraging but realistic - Self-knowledge is not easily attained. Many hear these teachings as mere philosophy; few truly realize them. And verse 30 brings closure to the argument: \"Be not anxious about these armies. The Spirit in man is imperishable.\"\n\nToday, reflect on your relationship with this teaching. Do you hear it with \"surprise\" - as something new and intriguing? Do you think it \"marvellous\" - intellectually fascinating? Or do you \"listen without comprehending\" - the words going in but not transforming your life? The gap between hearing about the immortal Self and knowing it as your lived reality is the journey of spiritual practice. What would it take to move from intellectual understanding to direct experience? Consider that every moment of genuine self-inquiry - asking \"Who am I?\" and waiting for the answer - brings you closer to that realization."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 2, Sankhya Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge. So far we have seen in the chapter that Bhagavan explained to Arjuna his situation from various perspectives, not just one perspective, that this is my idea, you should do this. But he gave him various perspectives. The first perspective, spiritual perspective, from the highest perspective, from the spirit's point of view that the self is immutable, imperishable. So that's the highest perspective. Then it came down to the society's perspective.\n\nAnd see, from a society's perspective, you as a Kshatriya has duty to protect the society from evil. If you see that evil is occurring in the society, we rely on the Kshatriya just like we rely on our armies to protect ourselves. Our army cannot become pacifist at the last minute. From that perspective, this is the best opportunity you have to perform your art and perform your duty. So society's perspective, he gave his opinion that this is still what you should be looking at. Then came down the individual's perspective.\n\nThere we have seen Bhagavan said, if you give up, you run away from your duty, then you will incur sin. He has looked at the issue from various perspectives and came to the same conclusion that Arjuna should fight this war. So in the process, Bhagavan also taught us the art of persuasion. To persuade somebody who is bent upon doing something other than what we think is right for him, just giving your opinion that \"look, you are doing something wrong\" is not going to work. The only way that works is when you give him a three dimensional view of his situation, give him the view from various perspectives, look at it from various points of view and then the person will be able to see it correctly, then you will be able to persuade him. This can also be applied to looking at any problem or situation.\n\nSay you come across a situation where you got a job in another town -- that's best for you. From your professional perspective, well, that's great. But if you take the decision just based on that, it may or may not be right. So you have to look at it from various perspectives. First you say, well from a professional perspective it seems like that job will give me more opportunity to go further in my career. Then you see it from family's perspective.\n\nWill my family be comfortable relocating from this town to another? Will they be able to adjust as easily as they are adjusted here? Then lastly, you also have to see what the school district is in that new town. Is it as good or better in that town? And if you come to the same conclusion from all three of them, then relocation is the great idea. Take the job and move or you will find that you will end up commuting just like most of our friends do who work outside Richmond in Washington or or other places.\n\nSo any problem or situation cannot be viewed from just one perspective. And you can come to right decision or you can convince someone. So this art of persuasion is to give somebody a three dimensional view of a situation and then come to the conclusion. In this case, Bhagavan came to the same conclusion from all perspectives. From a spiritual, from a society's perspective, from individual Arjuna must fight this war. What typically works best is when it comes to me, I can see from my perspective that it is right.\n\nSo therefore Bhagavan put more stress on his individual situation. So we have seen that he's saying tathaha swadharma kirtim hitva papa vapsyasi. If you give up your duties, you will incur Papa. And this obviously is very dreaded word in Hindu society that you will incur papa. So that obviously worked probably more effectively. But you had the background of other two perspectives that this is right, this is the right thing to do from all perspectives.\n\nSo Bhagavan pursue that point of view a little further and says, bhayat ranat uparatam mansante tvam maharathaha isam chatvam bahumatah bhatva yasyasi lagavam. So all these great warriors who are gathered here on our side and on the other side, they have very high regards for you. Because of your valor and your prowess. Even your enemies are unwillingly accepting that you are one of the best warriors. It is not easy to confront you. You are the one who has achieved the pasupatastra from Lord Shiva himself.\n\nObviously there's a story that Arjunaya goes for tapas to please Lord Shiva. And in the end he ended up fighting with Lord Shiva himself. But Lord Shiva was so pleased that he revealed himself that I am not just the hunter which you are fighting, but I am Lord Shiva. Here is the Pashupadashtra. And as the Purana says, the Pasupatastra is like ultimate weapon. It can destroy the entire universe in no time.\n\nSo you are the one who has such a prowess that you can destroy everybody in no time if you really choose to. However, you cannot use any weapon irresponsibly. Just like our nuclear weapons. You may have capability but you may never use it. He said those people, they will then think that you ran away from this war because of fear. Even though that may not be reality but that's how you will be viewed by your peers and your enemies.\n\nThey will belittle you, they have high respect for you. And they will say I don't know what we were thinking. This guy turned out to be not really what we thought he is going to be. It's not something very comfortable for you if that happens. So the next verse says: not only will you disappoint your friends, relatives, and the people who are relying on you in society, but there are also Ahita people -- those who are not your well-wishers, your enemies who wish you would go away. They will be telling stories about your cowardice. All kinds of Bahun Avachya Vadaan -- things which we cannot repeat on national TV. That kind of talk, they will be talking about you. So please think about it.\n\nNinantaha, tava, samaratyam. They will be cavilling at your prowess. That I think it was all big hype. It was all made up stories that he is such a great warrior. I don't think he had those qualities. And if that's happened, what is more painful than that?\n\nThat nobody will ever realize that you ran away because you thought that killing your cousins and your teachers is not a right thing to do. But they will think it's a fear of war, fear of defeat which made you go away. So don't think this is going to be easy. If you go away -- well, in any deal we make, you have to come up with a win-win situation. The only way the deal gets closed is when a client thinks I can provide the most appropriate services and I think this is the right project for me -- then only do we sign a contract. If either party doesn't think it's right, nothing happens.\n\nYou have to come up with a win-win situation where both parties will have a good outcome. Now in this case, looking at our own situation, any decision I take from the options available to me -- I should feel comfortable that it will be an acceptable situation for me. So Bhagavan now uses that final trump card and says if you die, you will go to the hero's heaven. So there is a special section of heaven which is reserved for these great heroes who die on the battlefield.\n\nIt's like the GI Bill, these great privileges in heaven for the heroes who serve their country, serve the society, in the process they die. You can think about the health care workers who lost their lives in this battle against Corona. So our scripture says there is a special section in heaven to reward them for their valor and their courage. Hatova Prapsesi Swargam Jitwava Bakshishe Mahim. If you die, you go to the heaven for the heroes. If you win, you will lead the kingdom on this earth.\n\nThis is a no-brainer for you. There is no way you can lose -- fight and die, or fight and win. Either way, you come out ahead. So there is nothing to think about. Here the only good decision is fight the war. Therefore he says, Tasmat Utthishtka Yudhaya Krutan Nishayah.\n\nTherefore O son of Kunti, get up with a resolve to fight this war. So this is like a conclusive statement from Bhagavan. In the beginning Arjuna asked him and said, give me which is shreyas for me. And we have come across the word shreyas and prayers before. That which is always good. It may not feel good, but it is good for me.\n\nPreyas feels good but is not good for me. And Arjuna, in no uncertain terms, asked Bhagavan: tell me what is good for me and I will do it. Now Bhagavan says Utthiste Kamanteya, get up with the resolve to fight this war. So that was the conclusive advice from Bhagavan. And then Bhagavan now introduces the concept of Karma Yoga. You have to act in this world and there will be consequences of your actions.\n\nYou are part of this world. This Sansa and this Sansar is not homogeneous experiences. The experiences are varied. Some are conducive, some are not conducive. You will fight the war. Outcome is not guaranteed.\n\nThe experience will not be as you predict. It may be something different. But you have to treat whatever you face with an equal state of mind. You have to treat them alike no matter what the outcome is. Because you are enjoying the ride in this world. The next verse now introduces the idea of how to transform Karma into Karma Yoga.\n\nSame action, but changing the mental attitude, becomes Karma Yoga. It says: Sukha Dukhe Same Kritva Labha Alabhou Jaya Ajayou, Tato Yuddhaya Yujyasva, Naivam Papam Avapsyasi. We came back to Papa again. In verse 33 he said Tatah Svadharmam Kirtim Cha Hitva Papam Avapsyasi -- You will incur sin if you abandon your duty. Here he says Tatha yudhaya yujyashwa na evam papam avapshasi.\n\nYou will not incur any sin. But the condition is Sukha Dukhe Same Kritva -- you should treat pleasure and pain alike. It's more like being an observer. It does not mean that you react to pleasure and pain in the same way, but you treat them alike as an observer, maintaining equanimity.\n\nFor example, when someone thinks \"I should have a cup of coffee,\" the one who is thinking about having that cup of coffee -- that's an observer. That observer should be neutral, treating anything which comes with equanimity. Sukha and Dukha operate at the mental level -- these are my experiences. When I experience something, there will be a mental reaction saying \"this is conducive\" or \"this is not conducive, not good.\"\n\nThen there's profit and loss, which operates at the intellectual level. Am I making profit by doing this or I'm losing something? Here is my intellect. I actually thought I'm gonna get this but I didn't get that.\n\nAnd therefore this is a loss or this is a profit. So that's at the intellectual level. Finally both Jaya and Ajaya victory or defeat is at the physical level. I tried to gain something, I did not gain it. I competed against several firms to get a project. That's a real reality, the physical reality that I don't have that project anymore.",
      "reflection": "Having established the spiritual foundation, Krishna now addresses Arjuna from the perspective of Dharma - righteous duty. \"Thou must look at thy duty. Nothing can be more welcome to a soldier than a righteous war. Therefore to waver in this resolve is unworthy\" (verse 31). This is Swadharma - one's own duty based on one's nature, training, and role in life. Arjuna is a Kshatriya, a warrior; protecting society from adharma is his sacred responsibility.\n\nVerse 32 presents the opportunity positively: \"Blessed are the soldiers who find their opportunity. This opportunity has opened for thee the gates of heaven.\" Far from being a curse, facing this battle is actually a blessing - a chance to fulfill one's highest duty. But verse 33 warns of the consequences of abandoning that duty: \"Refuse to fight in this righteous cause, and thou wilt be a traitor, lost to fame, incurring only sin.\"\n\nApply this teaching by identifying your own Swadharma. What is your unique role, given your nature, skills, training, and circumstances? Are you fulfilling it, or are you wavering at a critical moment? Remember that Dharma is contextual - what is right changes based on time, place, and role. A soldier's dharma differs from a monk's. Today, ask yourself: What is the \"righteous battle\" I am being called to fight? Where am I being asked to step up but holding back due to fear or attachment? What opportunity for growth or service am I treating as a burden rather than a blessing?"

      "reflection": "Krishna now appeals to Arjuna's sense of honor and reputation. \"Men will talk forever of thy disgrace; and to the noble, dishonour is worse than death\" (verse 34). This is not about ego or pride, but about the practical consequences of abandoning one's duty. Verse 35 adds: \"Great generals will think that thou hast fled from the battlefield through cowardice; though once honoured thou wilt seem despicable.\" Those who respected Arjuna will lose that respect. His enemies will mock him: \"Thine enemies will spread scandal and mock at thy courage. Can anything be more humiliating?\" (verse 36).\n\nNotice Krishna's masterful teaching approach: He presents the same conclusion - that Arjuna must fight - from multiple angles. First the spiritual perspective (the Self is immortal), then the duty perspective (Swadharma), and now the social perspective (honor and reputation). This three-dimensional view helps Arjuna see clearly from all angles. A decision supported by spiritual truth, aligned with duty, and acceptable to society is more likely to be correct.\n\nToday, apply this multi-perspective analysis to a decision you are facing. How does it look from the spiritual perspective - what is most aligned with your highest Self? From the duty perspective - what does your role and responsibility demand? From the social perspective - how will your choice be perceived, and can you stand behind it? If all three perspectives point in the same direction, you have strong guidance. If they conflict, examine which concern is truly valid and which might be fear or attachment in disguise."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 2, Sankhya Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge. So far we have seen in the chapter that Bhagavan explained to Arjuna his situation from various perspectives -- not just one perspective saying, \"this is my idea, you should do this.\" He gave him various perspectives. The first was the spiritual perspective, from the highest point of view: the self is immutable, imperishable. So that's the highest perspective. Then it came down to the society's perspective.\n\nAnd see, from a society's perspective, you as a Kshatriya have a duty to protect the society from evil. If you see that evil is occurring in the society, we rely on the Kshatriya just like we rely on our armies to protect ourselves. Our army cannot become pacifist at the last minute. From that perspective, this is the best opportunity you have to perform your duty. So from society's perspective, he gave his opinion that this is still what you should be looking at. Then came the individual's perspective.\n\nThere we have seen Bhagavan said, if you give up and run away from your duty, then you will incur sin. He has looked at the issue from various perspectives and came to the same conclusion that Arjuna should fight this war.\n\nSo in the process, Bhagavan also taught us the art of persuasion. If you want to persuade somebody who is bent upon doing something other than what we think is right for him, just giving your opinion -- \"look, you are doing something wrong\" -- is not going to work. The only way that works is when you give him a three-dimensional view of his situation from various perspectives. Look at it from various points of view, and then the person will be able to see it correctly. Then you will be able to persuade him. This can also be applicable to looking at any problem, any situation.\n\nYou come across a situation where you got a job in another town, that's best for you. From your professional perspective, well that's great. But if you take the decision just based on that, it may or may not be right. So you have to look at it from various perspectives. First you say, well from a professional perspective it seems like that job will give me more opportunity to go further in my career. Then you see it from family's perspective.\n\nWill my family be comfortable relocating from this town to another? Will they be able to adjust as easily as they are adjusted here? Then lastly, you also have to see what the school district is like in that new town. Is it as good or better? And if you come to the same conclusion from all three perspectives, then relocation is a great idea. Take the job and move -- or you will find that you will end up commuting just like most of our friends do who work outside Richmond in Washington or other places.\n\nSo any problem or situation cannot be viewed from just one perspective. And you can come to right decision or you can convince someone. So this art of persuasion is to give somebody a three dimensional view of a situation and then come to the conclusion. In this case, Bhagavan came to the same conclusion from all perspectives. From a spiritual, from a society's perspective, from individual Arjuna must fight this war. What typically works best is when it comes to me and I can see from my own perspective that it is right.\n\nSo therefore Bhagavan put more stress on his individual situation. So we have seen that he's saying tathaha swadharma kirtim hitva papa vapsyasi. If you give up your duties, you will incur Papa. And this obviously is very dreaded word in Hindu society that you will incur papa. So that obviously worked probably more effectively. But you had the background of other two perspectives that this is right, this is the right thing to do from all perspectives.\n\nSo Bhagavan pursue that point of view a little further and says, bhayat ranat uparatam mansante tvam maharathaha isam chatvam bahumatah bhatva yasyasi lagavam. So all these great warriors who are gathered here on our side and on the other side, they have very high regards for you. Because of your valor and your prowess. They are unwillingly accepting your enemy, unwillingly accepting that you are one of the best warriors. It is not easy to confront you. You are the one who has achieved the pasupatastra from Lord Shiva himself.\n\nObviously there's a story that Arjunaya goes for tapas to please Lord Shiva. And in the end he ended up fighting with Lord Shiva himself. But Lord Shiva was so pleased that he revealed himself that I am not just the hunter which you are fighting, but I am Lord Shiva. Here is the Pashupadashtra. And as the Purana says, the Pasupatastra is like ultimate weapon. It can destroy the entire universe in no time.\n\nSo you are the one who has such a prowess that you can destroy everybody in no time if you really choose to. However, you cannot use any weapon irresponsibly. Just like our nuclear weapons. You may have capability but you may never use it. He said those people, they will then think that you ran away from this war because of fear. Even though that may not be reality but that's how you will be viewed by your peers and your enemies.\n\nThey will belittle you. Right now they have high respect for you, and they will say, \"I don't know what we were thinking. This guy turned out to be not really what we thought he was going to be.\" It's not something very comfortable for you if that happens.\n\nSo the next verse says: not only will you disappoint your friends and relatives and people who are relying on you, the society.\n\nBut there are ahitha people who are not your well wishers, you know, enemies who wish that you go away. He said they will be telling stories about your cowardice. All kinds of, you know, Bahun, vadish, shanti or vachevadas. Things which we cannot repeat on national tv. That kind of talk, they will be talking about you. So please think about it.\n\nNinantaha, tava, samaratyam. They will be cavilling at your prowess. That I think it was all big hype. It was all made up stories that he is such a great warrior. I don't think he had those qualities. And if that's happened, what is more painful than that?\n\nNobody will ever realize that you ran away because you thought that killing your cousins and your teachers is not a right thing to do. They will think it's a fear of war, fear of defeat, which made you go away. So don't think this is going to be easy if you go away.\n\nAnd then, in any deal which we make, you have to come up with a win-win situation. The only way a deal gets closed is when a client comes to me and thinks I can provide the most appropriate services, and I think this is the right project for me -- then only we sign a contract. If I don't think it is right, or he doesn't think it is right for him, nothing happens.\n\nSo you have to come up with a win-win situation where both parties will have a good outcome. Now in this case, if you are just looking at your own situation, any decision which I take out of the options available to me, I should feel comfortable that it will be an acceptable situation for me. So Bhagavan now uses that final trump card and says: if you die, you will go to the hero's heaven. So there is a special section of heaven which is reserved for these great heroes who die on the battlefield.\n\nIt's like the GI Bill, these great privileges in heaven for the heroes who serve their country, serve the society, in the process they die. You can think about the health care workers who lost their lives in this battle against Corona. So here our scripture says they have a special Saxon in heaven to reward them for their valor and their courage. Hatova Prapsesi Swargam Jitwava Bakshishe Mahim. If you die, you go to the heaven for the heroes. If you win, you will lead the kingdom on this earth.\n\nThis is a no-brainer for you. There is no way that you can lose, one way or the other. Fight and die, or fight and win -- both ways you come out ahead. So there is nothing to think about. Here the only good decision is to fight the war. Therefore he says, Tasmat Utthishtka Yudhaya Krutan Nishayah.\n\nTherefore O son of Kunti, get up with a resolve to fight this war. So this is like a conclusive statement from Bhagavan. In the beginning Arjuna asked him and said, give me which is shreyas for me. And we have come across the word shreyas and prayers before. That which is always good. It may not feel good, but it is good for me.\n\nPreyas, on the other hand, feels good but is not good for me. And Arjuna, in no uncertain terms, asked Bhagavan: tell me what is good for me and I will do it. Now Bhagavan says Utthiste Kaunteya, get up with the resolve to fight this war. So that was the conclusive advice from Bhagavan. And then Bhagavan now introduces the concept of Karma Yoga. You have to act in this world and there will be consequences of your actions.\n\nYou are part of this world. This Sansar is not made up of homogeneous experiences. The experiences are varied -- some are conducive, some are not conducive. You will fight the war. Outcome is not guaranteed.\n\nThe experience will not be as you predict. It may be something different. But you have to treat whatever you face with an equal state of mind. You have to treat them alike no matter what the outcome is. Because you are enjoying the ride in this world. The next verse now introduces the idea of how to transform Karma into Karma Yoga.\n\nSame action, changing the mental attitude becomes Karma yoga. It says Sukhdu KE samy krutva alabha jaya jayo Tathaya yujaswa na evam papam avapsyasi. We came back to the papa again. So in verse 33 he said that Tathaha swadharma kirtim chahitva papam awapsyasi. You will incur sin if you abandon your duty. Here he says Tatha yudhaya yujyashwa na evam papam avapshasi.\n\nYou will not incur any sin. But the condition is sukha dukkha samay krutva sukhyana dukkha. You should treat them alike. It's more like an observer. It does not mean that you react to Sukhanidukha in the same way but you treat them alike as an observer. It's like that to me.\n\nOne part of me says, \"I think I should have a cup of coffee.\" The one who is thinking about me having a cup of coffee -- that's the observer. See, that observer should be neutral. He should be treating anything which comes alike. Sukha and Dukkha operate at the mental level -- my experience. When I experience something, there will be a mental reaction: \"this is conducive\" or \"this is not conducive.\"\n\nThen there is profit and loss -- that operates at the intellectual level. Am I making a profit by doing this, or am I losing something? That's my intellect at work. I actually thought I was going to get this, but I didn't get that.\n\nAnd therefore this is a loss or this is a profit. So that's at the intellectual level. Finally both Jaya and Ajaya victory or defeat is at the physical level. I tried to gain something, I did not gain it. I competed against several firms to get a project. That's a real reality, the physical reality that I don't have that project anymore.",
      "reflection": "Verse 37 presents a win-win scenario: \"If killed, thou shalt attain Heaven; if victorious, enjoy the kingdom of earth. Therefore arise, O Son of Kunti, and fight!\" Either outcome is favorable when one acts from duty with the right attitude. This removes the paralysis of \"what if I fail?\" - both success and failure have their rewards when the action itself is righteous.\n\nVerse 38 introduces the transformative attitude of Karma Yoga: \"Look upon pleasure and pain, victory and defeat, with an equal eye. Make ready for the combat, and thou shalt commit no sin.\" This equanimity (Samatva) is the key that transforms ordinary action into yoga. And verse 39 transitions to the practical teaching: \"I have told thee the philosophy of Knowledge. Now listen and I will explain the philosophy of Action, by means of which... thou shalt break through the bondage of all action.\"\n\nPractice this today by choosing one challenging task and approaching it with equanimity. Before beginning, consciously decide: \"I will give my best effort, and I will accept whatever outcome arises with equal composure.\" Notice the difference this makes - without attachment to results, you can focus fully on the action itself, making you more effective. At the day's end, reflect: Did viewing success and failure equally allow you to act more freely? Did releasing outcome-attachment reduce your stress and increase your engagement? This is the beginning of Karma Yoga in daily life."

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing Chapter 2, Sankhya Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge. So far we have discussed up to the verse 30, the knowledge of Sankhya, the knowledge about your own self. What is the nature of the self? And then now I'll teach you the Buddhi Yoga. I'll teach you the Yoga of how to implement this knowledge in your life. Buddhi Yoga, Intelligent way of living.\n\nAnd then Bhagavan said, the way to work in this world is to have equanimity. Equanimity comes from your understanding of what you are getting into. If you understand the field of actions, the nature of the field of actions, the equanimity comes easily, naturally. If you do not understand the field of action, then obviously you will have difficulties. And we have used the example of roller coaster. That one who is standing in the line with all the enthusiasm, he knows what is the nature of the roller coaster.\n\nHe anticipates the ups and downs and twists and turns. That's the thrill of riding a roller coaster. If there were no ups and downs and twists and turns, there is no fun in a roller coaster. The more twists and turns, the more enjoyable it is -- then you go back and stand in line again. So if you enter this Sansar with the expectation that there will be ups and downs, twists and turns -- Sukhaduka, Lava Alabha, Jaya Jaya.\n\nWell that's the thrill of living in Sansar. So at the end of this life we'll come to the conclusion that that was pretty thrilling ride. Well, let's do it all over again. That's Kurupunar Janma. We'll stand in line again in that Sansa. While we are on that ride we forget that this is what we signed up for.\n\nThat's where problem comes. So Bhagavan said keep that in mind that these are natural and this is what you signed up for. The goal of life is to realize your true self. Which is what Bhagavan said I taught you in the first portion of this discussion. Now I want to tell you how to use that knowledge to realize that ultimate truth, the self, the nature of yourself. Bhagavan Ved Vyas discusses what is the difficulty we have in understanding our Darshan Shastras.\n\nSo we have basically discussed in the beginning there are six schools of thought and the school of thought which is based on the previous portion of Veda called Karmakanda. So all Vedas are divided into four parts. There are the mantras, then Brahmanas, then Aranyakas, and then Upanishads. The philosophy which is more centered around Karmakand. The Brahmana portion is called Purva Vimansa. We have discussed before, in Purva Mimsa, the goal of life is to reach heavens.\n\nAnd in heavens then you will have supra sensuous experiences to make you feel happy. Every good action we perform will create merits. You accumulate enough merits so you can go to Swarga. And in that Swarga, then you will have these enjoyments. When you exhaust your balance of your merits, you will come back again, work again for the more merits and go back to Swarga again. But that's the goal of life in Purva Mimsa.\n\nAnd therefore the society in general placed more emphasis on collecting merits and various ways to do yajnas and rituals. So the means of rituals was supposed to be to purify your mind and intellect so you can become single pointed. But the means became the goal in the society and they completely missed the boat. So now we see the criticism from Bhagavan Ved Vyas that how we have missed that boat as a society. And we have seen time and again in history of India that these philosophers and the great thinkers have come to realign the religion back to its goal. So this spiritual aspect becomes available to all people.\n\nSo it seems that during Mahabharata time the spiritual aspect of the goal was not available to most people. People were stuck into the rituals. So Bhagawan Vedvyas criticizes those people who had been misguiding the generations. So he says in verse 42 yam imam puspitam vacam. Those people using the flowery language are unwise. The unwise people are using flowery language.\n\nThe language used in Brahmana portion of Bhagavadas. He said, they make it sound like that is the goal. Those description rituals are for you to purify your mind and intellectual. But here they have made it sound like that is the goal. This is what you should be doing. Then it became so elaborate and society was so indulgent into it, that average person was afraid of the word yoga or Yajna.\n\nBecause in each ritual it has been said that if you don't perform it correctly, you will incur sin -- there will be an adverse effect. So you have to have an expert to tell you how to do it. And each ritual became so elaborate, describing what type of bricks to be used, how the bricks are to be arranged for the yajna. So an average person was afraid of the word yajna or yoga, with the fear that \"if I do something wrong, rather than accumulating merits, I'll accumulate demerits.\"\n\nTherefore, Bhagavan in the previous verse has given us this assurance: this yoga, this Buddhi Yoga, when you perform it, there is no danger of any adverse effect. And even a little practice -- you don't have to be an expert.\n\nYou don't have to perform it to a level where you become a master. Even the starting of a little effort will not go in vain. So it's a complete contradiction to what was prevalent in ritualism. In ritualistic practice, you have to do it correctly; if you don't do it correctly, there will be an adverse effect. Here Bhagavan said, no, no -- there is no adverse effect in this Buddhi Yoga, there is no adverse effect.\n\nYou perform your actions in this manner with equanimity of mind and you will be liberated from all your karma bandana, the bondages of actions. So now Bhagawan is criticizing the people who are using flowery language to make people confused about what is right and what is wrong. And he said Veda Vadharathaha. They take great pleasure and using the words of Vedas Na anyat asti ITI Vadhi Naham. They say there is nothing other than this, other than this, other than this Karma Kanda, other than this rituals, other than to accumulate merits and go to heaven, there is nothing else there. Completely missing the boat.\n\nThe goal of life is to achieve that oneness with yourself, understanding the self. Kamatmana Swarga Paraha. Because they're desirous of achieving Swarga. So the Swarga became the ultimate goal. They said that Veda says that Karmakand, you should be doing all these karmas. When you do, you will accumulate merits and you will go to Swarga.\n\nSo Swarga became the goal of life. Swarga Paraha Janma, Karma Falla Pradha -- which promises new birth as the renewal of their actions. You will come back again, you will have more enjoyments, and you go to Swarga again. Kriya Vishesha Bahula -- and there are all kinds of rituals. They don't have one single goal. They also do not follow one single path.\n\nThere are so many desires and so many goals. So now you can say that even though this criticism is for the Karmakanda, if you look at our lives, it is exactly that we are all Karma Kandis. We do all kinds of actions to achieve all types of different results, different accomplishments and achievements. Kriya vi says Bahula. They are engaged in too many different types of activities, too many different types of rituals. Bhoga Aishwarya gatimprati.\n\nBecause we want to achieve the Bhoga and Aishwarya -- enjoyments and power -- that became the goal of life, then and even now. We have no one single goal, and therefore we are not focused. And therefore we cannot achieve what we think is our birthright, which is happiness. Because we have lost ourselves into all these Kriyas. Bhagavan Ved Vyas criticizes those people who have preached that the goal of life is to go to heaven to elevate your standard of living. Now we have come to conclusion that no matter what status you have in the society, what achievement you have, what accomplishment you have, your problems remain the same.\n\nWhether you are working at the lowest rank of the society or you are the highest rank of the society, basic problems which we face, which makes us unhappy, remain exactly the same. So this Bhogaira Aishwarya is not going to give us what we are ultimately looking for, which is happiness. And Bhagawan continues the criticism. Bhogeswarya prasaktanaam taya apruta cheta sam. Their intellect is taken away. They have lost their rational intellect -- the ability to discern what will give them happiness.\n\nBecause they are Bhoga Aishwarya Prasaktana -- engaged in enjoyment and power. This fixation with enjoyment and power, with raising the standard of your living, has made us lose the goal of life: that we want to be happy. It is pure and simple. Vyavasayatmika Buddhi Samadhau Na Vidhiyati. Those who are engaged in this variety of activities to achieve varieties of goals cannot have the single-pointed mind, the single-pointed intellect, to achieve their oneness with self.\n\nThat oneness with yourself is the only means to achieve happiness. The conclusion of Vedanta so Bhagavan Ved Vyas who wrote the Brahma Sutra as Rishi Badaraya, crystallized this knowledge of Upanishad, saying that the goal of life is to achieve the oneness with your true self. Once you realize your true self, all that which you're seeking, all your life will be yours. Peace and happiness will be your birthright. So far we have learned from Bhagavan the ultimate truth which is revealed in Upanishads. That is Brahma, Satya, Jagat, Mithya, the Atma, Satya, Deha Mithya.\n\nThat which is permanent is Satya. That which is superimposed on the permanent is Mithya. For example, if somebody is wearing a Halloween costume, a child is wearing a Halloween costume and you ask, is that you, Medha? And she said, no, I'm a witch. That which is Mithya, Medha is Satya. Because Medha is permanent, which is the superimposition.\n\nI dropped it like a hot potato. The hotness is superimposed on potato. Because that's not potato's inherent quality, that's an incidental quality superimposed on a potato. Potato borrowed that heat from boiling water or microwaves. That is not inherent in potato. So that hotness, that hot potato is Mithya.\n\nCoronavirus is Mithya. Because the coronavirus by itself has no real activity, it cannot do anything. It's only when there is a host, it manifests as infection. So Bhagavan taught us that this Deha is Mithya. But you, the Atma is satisfied. And therefore Arjuna, you should fight this battle of life.\n\nBut how to fight is then we learnt in the last verse which is Sukhadu khe samy Krutva la Balabha Jayajayo Toto Yudhaya Nayvam Papam, Ovaps that having that equanimity of mind to all these pairs of opposites, Sukhadukha la Balab Jaya Jaya. And then you engage in your life, in your actions, and you will not incur any sin. Now this seems fairly absurd advice. Because how can you be same for Sukha and Dukkha? Dukkha is going to upset me and Sukkah is going to elate me. But Bhagavan said no, this is a reality which if you understand, then you will be able to practice it.\n\nSo for example, if you Go to theme park and you see the people lining for roller coaster ride. So all these people are lining up enthusiastically. They know the nature of roller coaster. They have figured out roller coaster is made up of ascents and descents, twist and turns. Knowing fully well that this is the nature of roller coaster.",
      "reflection": "Verse 40 offers tremendous encouragement: \"On this Path, endeavour is never wasted, nor can it ever be repressed. Even a very little of its practice protects one from great danger.\" Unlike ritualistic practices where incorrect performance brings adverse effects, in Buddhi Yoga even small efforts yield lasting benefits. No sincere spiritual effort is ever lost - this is a powerful reassurance for seekers worried about \"doing it wrong.\"\n\nVerse 41 distinguishes focused wisdom from scattered thinking: \"The straying intellect becomes steadied in the contemplation of one object only; whereas the minds of the irresolute stray into bypaths innumerable.\" Having one clear goal creates focus; having many competing desires creates confusion. And verse 42 begins a critique of those who miss the deeper purpose of scriptures: \"Only the ignorant speak in figurative language... saying, 'There is nothing deeper than this.'\" They mistake the means (rituals for purification) for the end (Self-realization).\n\nExamine your own life for scattered focus. How many different things are you pursuing, hoping each will bring fulfillment? The teaching suggests that this multiplicity itself prevents happiness. Today, try this: identify your single most important goal - not your many wants, but your one true aim. How would your day look different if every action was aligned with this one purpose? Also notice if you are confusing means with ends anywhere in your life - pursuing money, status, or pleasure as goals in themselves rather than as potential means to a deeper fulfillment."

Bhagavan Ved Vyas discusses what is the difficulty we have in understanding our Darshan Shastras.\n\nSo we have basically discussed in the beginning there are six schools of thought and the school of thought which is based on the previous portion of Veda called Karmakanda. So all Vedas are divided into four parts. There are the mantras, then Brahmanas, then Aranyakas, and then Upanishads. The philosophy which is more centered around Karmakand. The Brahmana portion is called Purva Vimansa. We have discussed before, in Purva Mimsa, the goal of life is to reach heavens.\n\nAnd in heavens then you will have supra sensuous experiences to make you feel happy. Every good action we perform will create merits. You accumulate enough merits so you can go to Swarga. And in that Swarga, then you will have these enjoyments. When you exhaust your balance of your merits, you will come back again, work again for the more merits and go back to Swarga again. But that's the goal of life in Purva Mimsa.\n\nAnd therefore the society in general placed more emphasis on collecting merits and various ways to do yajnas and rituals. So the means of rituals was supposed to be to purify your mind and intellect so you can become single pointed. But the means became the goal in the society and they completely missed the boat. So now we see the criticism from Bhagavan Ved Vyas that how we have missed that boat as a society. And we have seen time and again in history of India that these philosophers and the great thinkers have come to realign the religion back to its goal. So this spiritual aspect becomes available to all people.\n\nSo it seems that during Mahabharata time the spiritual aspect of the goal was not available to most people. People were stuck into the rituals. So Bhagawan Vedvyas criticizes those people who had been misguiding the generations. So he says in verse 42 yam imam puspitam vacam. Those people using the flowery language are unwise. The unwise people are using flowery language.\n\nThe language used in Brahmana portion of Bhagavadas. He said, they make it sound like that is the goal. Those description rituals are for you to purify your mind and intellectual. But here they have made it sound like that is the goal. This is what you should be doing. Then it became so elaborate and society was so indulgent into it, that average person was afraid of the word yoga or Yajna.\n\nBecause in each ritual it has been said that if you don't perform it correctly, you will incur sin -- there will be an adverse effect. So you have to have an expert to tell you how to do it. And each ritual became so elaborate, describing what type of bricks to be used, how the bricks are to be arranged for the yajna. So an average person was afraid of the word yajna or yoga, with the fear that \"if I do something wrong, rather than accumulating merits, I'll accumulate demerits.\"\n\nTherefore, Bhagavan in the previous verse has given us this assurance: this yoga, this Buddhi Yoga, when you perform it, there is no danger of any adverse effect. And even a little practice -- you don't have to be an expert.\n\nYou don't have to perform it to a level where you become a master. Even the starting of a little effort will not go in vain. So it's a complete contradiction to what was prevalent in ritualism. In ritualistic practice, you have to do it correctly; if you don't do it correctly, there will be an adverse effect. Here Bhagavan said, no, no -- there is no adverse effect in this Buddhi Yoga, there is no adverse effect.\n\nYou perform your actions in this manner with equanimity of mind and you will be liberated from all your karma bandana, the bondages of actions. So now Bhagawan is criticizing the people who are using flowery language to make people confused about what is right and what is wrong. And he said Veda Vadharathaha. They take great pleasure and using the words of Vedas Na anyat asti ITI Vadhi Naham. They say there is nothing other than this, other than this, other than this Karma Kanda, other than this rituals, other than to accumulate merits and go to heaven, there is nothing else there. Completely missing the boat.\n\nThe goal of life is to achieve that oneness with yourself, understanding the self. Kamatmana Swarga Paraha. Because they're desirous of achieving Swarga. So the Swarga became the ultimate goal. They said that Veda says that Karmakand, you should be doing all these karmas. When you do, you will accumulate merits and you will go to Swarga.\n\nSo Swarga became the goal of life. Swarga Paraha Janma, Karma Falla Pradha -- which promises new birth as the renewal of their actions. You will come back again, you will have more enjoyments, and you go to Swarga again. Kriya Vishesha Bahula -- and there are all kinds of rituals. They don't have one single goal. They also do not follow one single path.\n\nThere are so many desires and so many goals. So now you can say that even though this criticism is for the Karmakanda, if you look at our lives, it is exactly that we are all Karma Kandis. We do all kinds of actions to achieve all types of different results, different accomplishments and achievements. Kriya vi says Bahula. They are engaged in too many different types of activities, too many different types of rituals. Bhoga Aishwarya gatimprati.\n\nBecause we want to achieve the Bhoga and Aishwarya -- enjoyments and power -- that became the goal of life, then and even now. We have no one single goal, and therefore we are not focused. And therefore we cannot achieve what we think is our birthright, which is happiness. Because we have lost ourselves into all these Kriyas. Bhagavan Ved Vyas criticizes those people who have preached that the goal of life is to go to heaven to elevate your standard of living. Now we have come to conclusion that no matter what status you have in the society, what achievement you have, what accomplishment you have, your problems remain the same.\n\nWhether you are working at the lowest rank of the society or you are the highest rank of the society, basic problems which we face, which makes us unhappy, remain exactly the same. So this Bhogaira Aishwarya is not going to give us what we are ultimately looking for, which is happiness. And Bhagawan continues the criticism. Bhogeswarya prasaktanaam taya apruta cheta sam. Their intellect is taken away. They have lost their rational intellect -- the ability to discern what will give them happiness.\n\nBecause they are Bhoga Aishwarya Prasaktana -- engaged in enjoyment and power. This fixation with enjoyment and power, with raising the standard of your living, has made us lose the goal of life: that we want to be happy. It is pure and simple. Vyavasayatmika Buddhi Samadhau Na Vidhiyati. Those who are engaged in this variety of activities to achieve varieties of goals cannot have the single-pointed mind, the single-pointed intellect, to achieve their oneness with self.\n\nThat oneness with yourself is the only means to achieve happiness. The conclusion of Vedanta so Bhagavan Ved Vyas who wrote the Brahma Sutra as Rishi Badaraya, crystallized this knowledge of Upanishad, saying that the goal of life is to achieve the oneness with your true self. Once you realize your true self, all that which you're seeking, all your life will be yours. Peace and happiness will be your birthright. So we had been discussing Chapter 2, Sankhya Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge. And so far we have seen that Bhagavan gave us the knowledge of the Sankhya which is teaching us that this self is immortal, this body is mortal.\n\nAt the death of the body, this ego continues its journey, taking along with it the mind and intellect and its tendencies. Based on those tendencies, that ego will continue to exist in various states of existence which we call Janma. Knowing this, that the self is only immortal. If your goal is to have infinite happiness, your goal should be to identify with the self and not with the ego. And to do that is to live your life now with that clear understanding that I am the manifestation, the supreme self, and not the ego, which is identified with this body, mind and intellect, and that way of thinking and acting. Accordingly, he called it Buddha Yoga.\n\nThat's a Buddha Intelligent living, as we call it, knowing fully well what is my goal and how to achieve it, then I put it into practice is the intelligent way of living. So that's called Buddhi Yoga. Keeping in mind, my goal is happiness and nothing other than happiness. Whatever gives me happiness, I will do it. But on our way, we have taken the means for the goal, therefore the means to get happiness, which is to acquire things, to accomplish things. We consider now that to be our goal.\n\nThat's where the problem is. Then he said, why this happens because we have taken the wrong advice from the wrong people. So he criticizes the pundits who had been propagating the words of Vedas. And he said that they use this flowery language and promise all the pleasures and all the lordship here and hereafter. What we call it is Swargalok, that you do this and you will achieve this. So we have this, you know, basically quit for whatever the word is quit for Kuro, type of an arrangement where you do this and you will get this.\n\nAnd he said they use this language which is so enchanting to you that you get caught up in that.",
      "reflection": "These verses continue the critique of those who pursue religious practices for worldly ends. Verse 43 describes those who \"construct their own heaven, devising arduous and complex rites to secure their own pleasure and their own power; and the only result is rebirth.\" Their religious activity is driven by desire (Kama) for enjoyment (Bhoga) and power (Aishwarya) - essentially using spiritual means for material ends.\n\nVerse 44 explains why this approach fails: \"While their minds are absorbed with ideas of power and personal enjoyment, they cannot concentrate their discrimination on one point.\" A mind scattered across many desires cannot achieve the single-pointed focus needed for Self-realization. Then verse 45 gives the solution: \"Rise above all of them, O Arjuna, above all the pairs of opposing sensations; be steady in truth, free from worldly anxieties and centered in the Self.\" The three Gunas (Sattva, Rajas, Tamas) and the pairs of opposites (pleasure-pain, gain-loss) must be transcended.\n\nReflect honestly: Are your spiritual practices aimed at genuine transformation, or are they subtly seeking worldly benefits - health, prosperity, success, recognition? There is nothing wrong with these things, but if they become the goal of spiritual practice, we miss the point entirely. The teaching also applies beyond religion: whenever we pursue multiple goals simultaneously, pulled by various desires, we lack the focus to achieve what truly matters. Today, examine what you are really seeking through your activities. Can you identify one overarching purpose that would give meaning to everything else?"

      "commentary": "We are now discussing Chapter 2, Sankhya Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge. So far we have seen that Bhagavan gave the knowledge of Sankhya. The Sankhya Darshan is Gina Darshan. It takes us step by step what the reality is. From verse 11 through 30 he gave us this Tankhya Darshan, the Gnana Darshan. Then he said that now I'll teach you the Buddhi Yoga which is the application in your life, how to overcome the Prakruti.\n\nSo Sankhya Darshan says that Purusha and Prakruti are two separate entities. When Purusha gets involved with Prakruti, then all these problems start. The five kleshas start -- ragadvesha, etc. So Yoga Shastra says how to overcome this entanglement with Prakriti. That Yoga Shastra, Bhagavan says, I will now teach you. But Bhagavan coined a new word: Buddhi Yoga -- Yoga which is established in wisdom.\n\nSo Bhagawan is basically now teaching Arjuna the Yoga Sastra in a very simple format that we all can understand. Arjun, I can understand. We all can understand. We have touched upon a landmark verse in Bhagavad Gita -- verse 47 -- which is the most quoted verse in Bhagavad Gita. Most people quote this verse but only quote the first half of it.\n\nYou will hardly ever hear anybody quoting the entire verse. So the first line everybody is very familiar which says Karmanye vadhikarathe ma faleshu kadaa. And we quote that as if that's the instruction in reality, that is the statement of fact. The first line in that verse is statement of fact that you have only control over your actions, you do not have control over the fruits of actions. That's a statement of fact. All of us who can think about it will agree with that, that I can act or the results will come.\n\nI'm not the Karma Falada. Somebody else is either the world Bhagavan whoever you consider, but that's not you. But you do have control over actions. The second line is actually the prescription. The second line is the advice which says Maa karma fala hai turbuhu. Never engage in any action with the expectations of the results.\n\nIt's advice for us to be wise about how we act. You will never be able to guess what the results will be. You will never have control over them. There is no reason for you to invest your energy into it. Most of our energies are wasted in regrets of the past or in anxieties of the future, and then we have less enthusiasm in the present.\n\nSo Bhagavan said, therefore, therefore, never engage in action with a result in your mind. And then the last portion of that verse is mate Sangahatu akarmani. And never get attached to inaction by fear of failure or not having any clear direction. You do not want to get engaged in inaction. Instead it become tamasic. So basically the advice Bhagavan has given is very clear.\n\nEngage in action without any expectations. Many commentators said this is where you change from prayers to shrayas. So all Kamya karmas are for prayers. That which is going to be pleasant for me. Those actions which are not driven by the expectation of the fruits will lead you to Shreyas. Because you will be only focusing on the action itself.\n\nSo Bhagavan has given a clear direction and clear statement of the reality we live in. And now in the following verse, Bhagavan clearly demonstrate how one can engage in this activity. Yogastha Kuru Karmani. Establish yourself in yoga. How to practice this Gnana Darshan, this knowledge of the true self. As I said, there are two entities for Sankhya.\n\nPurusha who is always pure. Chaitanya but inactive. Prakruti which is inert but active. Prakriti does not have the consciousness but it is very active. And Purusha which is pure consciousness but inactive. When these two get entangled with each other, then the confusion starts.\n\nMaharishi Patanjali's Yoga Sutra said that Yoga Chitta Vritti Nirodha -- Yoga is to stop the modifications of your Chitta. The Chitta is like a mirror; it reflects the pure consciousness. But there are Chitta Vrittis -- modifications which create this confusion. Basically the functions of Chitta in our day-to-day life include: Pramana (right knowledge), Viparyaya (contrary knowledge, wrong knowledge), Vikalpa (doubt), Nidra (sleep or Tamas), and then Smriti (memory).\n\nThese five modifications of Chitta create flickering in our Chitta. They do not let the consciousness reflect purely. Once these Vrittis are negated, the Purusha is reflected through the Chitta in its pure form -- that is basically what the Yoga Shastra says. But this is very complicated for an average person to understand. So Bhagavan is now clarifying this in very simple terms which you and I can understand and try to practice. Yogastha Kuru Karmani: you have to establish yourself in yoga, then act outside.\n\nIf you are not established in yoga then actions will be haphazard. They will be driven by the results. Then obviously there will be all the side effects which come along with it. Sangam tyaktva Dhananjaya Swamiji points out this is the most important part of this verse and most people leave that out. Sangam tyaksva act in this world by establishing yourself in yoga and without any attachment. So even attachment to actions themselves in is detrimental.\n\nIf I get too attached -- \"I have to do this, I need to do this\" -- then it will be problematic. There may not be an opportunity for those particular actions. In other words, you should perform the actions which are appropriate, necessary, and available in that environment, and not insist on the particular actions you're attached to: \"I will only do this but I will not do anything else.\" In olden society in India, a Brahmin could only do certain work. He could not do menial work.\n\nAnd I know in times where there was not enough work, people suffered because they would not say, \"I will do this other work if my usual work is not available.\" Bhagawan said: don't get attached to actions. Whatever actions are available and appropriate, engage yourself in them. No attachment to what type of actions I'm performing -- I also have to establish myself in yoga.\n\nNow, when an average person hears the word yoga, he gets really frightened. \"You want me to become a yogi?\" He will say, \"Oh no, no, I don't want to become a yogi.\"\n\nI have my own life to live. I want to say: no, no, that's not what Yoga is all about. Yoga is something different. So what Maharishi Patanjali says as Chitta Vritti Nirodhaha, Bhagavan puts in a very different way which is very palatable to us. He said: Siddhi Asiddhi Samo Bhatva -- become even-minded to success and failure. Once again, going back to the previous verse, success and failure come from past actions.\n\nThe success and failures which I am experiencing now are actually results of my past actions. I have no control whatsoever on them anymore. I should have gone to medical college and I would have been a doctor and made more money and I'd be considered a frontline worker right now. I cannot change that. And therefore, whatever the results I'm facing right now, whether I consider them to be success or kind of failures, I should be even minded, take them as they are without attaching my likings and dislikings. Siddhi Asiddhi Samo Bhutva Samatvam Yoga Uchate -- the very first definition in Bhagavad Gita about Yoga: Samatvam Yoga Uchate. We will see more definitions, and therefore this chapter is so important.\n\nThese next three or four verses starting from 47 are so loaded with meaning -- they compress all the wisdom of Sankhya and Yoga into these few verses -- that we have to pay a lot of attention to understand them. Bhagavan said Siddhi Asiddhi Samo Bhatva: in a sense, do not pay attention to what you are getting because of your past actions. Treat them equally, with Prasada Buddhi. Engage in your present actions. Do not let your present actions get affected by the Siddhi or Asiddhi which you are facing right now. Samatvam Yoga Uchate -- the balance of mind is Yoga. So we go back to what Maharishi Patanjali said.\n\nYoga Chitta Vritti Nirodha. When Chitta is agitated by all these Vrittis -- right knowledge, contrary knowledge, memories, Nidra, Tamas -- all those Vrittis are creating impurities in Chitta. That Chitta is then not available to reflect the right knowledge, the right reality of who I am.\n\nBhagawan said Samatvam Yoga: this balance of mind which does not get affected either by the past or by anxiety of the future, which does not lose any enthusiasm in the present or in your current actions -- that is Yoga. Once you are established in this, your actions will bear right results.\n\nIn the next verse, how to look at the situation: Durena Hi Avaram Karma Buddhi Yogat Dhananjaya. Actions which are prompted by desires are far lower than Buddhi Yoga. Bhagawan is using a very unique term -- Buddhi Yoga. Buddhi Yoga is Yoga of wisdom, an intelligent way of living, establishing yourself in Buddhi.\n\nSo again, we have discussed before that Chitta is a thinking entity. The thinking entity has several functions. We know the three functions are Manas, Buddhi, and Ahankar. The Ahankar is always constant -- the \"I\" feeling is always constant. When that thinking entity is in doubt, it is mind.\n\nSankalpa Vikalpatmaka Manah. But Nischayatmika Buddhi -- Buddhi which is decisive: \"this is right, this is the truth, and this is what I should be working on.\" Once you establish yourself in that Buddhi, that wisdom of what is right and what is wrong, and you are not in that doubtful situation -- that is Buddhi Yoga. When Chitta is in that Nischayatmika mode, it's Buddhi. So Bhagavan said, engage yourself in Buddhi Yoga. That Buddhi Yoga is far better than Karma.\n\nAnd here Karma is only Kamya Karma. Desire prompted actions. Karma Khanda, all the actions all the way up to the desire to get Swarga is all Kamya Karma. Therefore all actions perform for those results. Bhagwan said anytime. Even though they may be the highest form of actions to achieve the best possible state of living or living standard, they are far lower than Buddhi Yoga.\n\nBuddhau Sharanam Anviccha -- take refuge in Buddhi. This also reminded me of \"Buddham Sharanam Gacchami, Dhammam Sharanam Gacchami, Sangham Sharanam Gacchami.\" I take refuge in Buddha, in the wisdom of Buddha. Here Bhagavan says: take refuge in your own wisdom. Buddhau Sharanam Anviccha. Kripanaha Phala Hetavah -- those who are working in this world to get conducive results, or to get the fruits of their actions all the way up to reaching the heavens.\n\nThey are Kripanaha -- unfortunate misers. The translation is \"wretched.\" Kripana means miser. A miser is always unfortunate because he never gets to enjoy his own wealth. He has all the wealth but can't enjoy it, so he's wretched. Those unfortunate people -- and that includes all of us who are working for the fruits of actions.\n\nThey are very unfortunate because they will never be able to enjoy fruits of their actions. They will always be in misery, either regretting the past or anxious about the future. They will never be living in present. They are always living in future or in past. They both are hypothetical situation. There is no past that I have experienced and there is no future that I have seen.\n\nAnytime I experience, it is always present. Bhagavan says those people are really unfortunate misers who waste their energies into past and in future and completely ignores the present. O shantihi shri gurubyonamaha harihio. So we had been discussing Chapter 2, Sankhya Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge. And so far we have seen that Bhagavan gave us the knowledge of the Sankhya which is teaching us that this self is immortal, this body is mortal.",
      "reflection": "Verse 47 is the most famous verse of the Gita: \"Thou hast only the right to work, but none to the fruit thereof. Let not then the fruit of thy action be thy motive; nor yet be thou enamored of inaction.\" This is not advice but a statement of fact: we control our actions but not their results, which depend on countless factors beyond us. The prescription follows: do not let results motivate your action, and do not use uncertainty of results as an excuse for inaction.\n\nVerse 48 gives the positive instruction: \"Perform all thy actions with mind concentrated on the Divine, renouncing attachment and looking upon success and failure with an equal eye. Spirituality implies equanimity.\" The definition \"Samatvam Yoga Uchyate\" - \"Equanimity is Yoga\" - transforms our understanding of spiritual practice from something done on a meditation cushion to a quality of mind maintained throughout all activity.\n\nToday, choose one action - perhaps your work, a conversation, or a household task - and practice Karma Yoga with it. Before beginning, consciously set your intention: \"I will do this to the best of my ability, as an offering, without attachment to the outcome.\" During the action, stay focused on the task itself rather than imagining future results. Afterward, accept whatever comes with equanimity. Notice: Does releasing attachment to results make you more or less effective? More or less peaceful? This is the laboratory where the Gita's teaching is tested."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter two. We had been discussing verse 47 onwards, most quoted verse in Bhagavad Gita, which is Karmani Vadikarastha. Between that verse 47 and 53, Bhagavan gives us concisely and succinctly how to live life. Because those scriptures give advice about how to live your life. Sometimes Hinduism is called way of life. So from verse 47 onward, we basically have seen is what is the reality of my life?\n\nReality of my life is: I am a living being, a conscious being, and therefore activity is what makes me who I am. I must be active. However, I must understand that the only thing which is in my control is my actions. The result of my actions are not in my control simply because there is infinite world out there that is the field of my actions. When I act in this field of my actions, the other forces affect the result of my actions which is not in my control. So I must keep the goal very high, which gives me the directions of my actions. So the goal gives us direction.\n\nBhagavad Gita did not say don't have any goal. It says Karmaniyeva adhikara ste ma faleshukadachan, not the fruits of action. It did not say don't keep any goal or don't plan anything in your life, just continue so keep the goal in your mind and then work accordingly. So the goal gives me direction in which direction I should put my actions. If I'm going from here to New York, I know one thing, I have to drive northward on 95, that my goal is to go to New York. It gives me direction which way to go, so I don't drive south.\n\nWhat it does not give me is what I will encounter on my way while I'm driving. I can generally predict that because I'm driving at 70 miles an hour. New York is 400 miles from here, therefore it takes me all of that, but it does not give me all the other information which affect my reaching New York. Previously we didn't have any way to predict what's going to happen on the way. So we have to rely only on our general judgment. And there was some traffic news broadcast which says what is the traffic pattern today?\n\nThen we have now the gps. We're trying to add more and more ability to predict what is going to affect my travel. My GPS also tells me there is traffic congestion 25 miles from here and it will last for 8 miles. May delay for 15 minutes. So would you like to take a detour? Every time I try to follow my GPS agna to take detour, I'm actually more delayed than the 15 minutes that GPS predicted.\n\nBecause GPS does have some information but not all information. It had information on my main route but didn't really have all the information detour we have to take. So I figured out that I better stay on the same course which I have started and decided. Because the Karma Phala is dependent on not just one factor but many factors which we may not have control over right now or we do not have control over the Bhagavan. Therefore you should not be worried about the Karma Phala because it is not in your hand. Karma is your right, that's in your control.\n\nFind a direction, find a goal in life. Find a direction and work accordingly. Karma Phala may not be because what's going to encounter while you're working, you will not know. And therefore he said ma karma fala hatu bahu. Therefore do not make the fruits as the motivator. We'll reach New York in six hours.\n\nBecause I'm driving at 70 miles an hour, that should not be the motivating force of my driving. My motivation is I need to reach New York and it is in north. Therefore I'm driving northward. I will deal with whatever comes in my way. If I have to take a detour, I'll take a detour. But I will reach New York.\n\nI don't know, but I will reach there. But never get discouraged and say, oh, there is a lot of traffic today. Ma sanghatu akarmani. Do not get attached to inaction because you predict there may be a lot of obstructions on your way. So this is the prescription given to us. Have a goal, find a direction and then continue working.\n\nDo not worry about what you will encounter. So the next verse says Siddhi asiddhi samo bhatva Yogastha kurukarman. Establish yourself in yoga and then work. I don't go to yoga classes. Panditji keeps telling me, but I keep avoiding. So now I can't do anything about it.\n\nYogastha kurukaraman established into a state of mind where this Siddhi Asiddhi does not affect you. I have to go to New York but right near the Ashland there's a huge traffic jam. That doesn't make me to make a U turn and come back home. Goal is to go there somehow to find a way to get over this. Therefore he said siddhi asidhi samo bhatva. Whatever comes in your way, take it equally.\n\nThis is still part of your life. So the yoga is samatvam Yoga uchade. So I should be establishing yoga. I say it's very simple. Keep your mind even in whatever situation you encounter. In other words, keep.\n\nKeep that goal still in your mind. Don't let that obstruction in your way discourage you. Your goal is to achieve that infinite happiness. Don't get discouraged. Success and failure are part of your life because it is guaranteed that sometimes you will succeed, and most of the time you will fail. We used to track the statistics -- what is our hit rate on our proposals? For a while I did that because I was trained by my previous employers to track the hit rate.\n\nThen I said boy these hit rates look very poor. Let's not look at it, let's stop this thing. Just keep doing what you are doing because if you get discouraged by the results then you will stop acting. Goal is to achieve what you want to achieve. So Bhagawan said samatam yoga uchathe keep your mind equanimous in all situation with the success or failures. That's very necessary because failures are going to be there.\n\nAnd then when you work in that manner you will be applying your full focus and therefore you will be very efficient in your actions. So we saw the next definition of yoga's Yogaha Karma Sukhaoshalam. When do I consider myself to be established in the samatvam? My actions become efficient. We all know this. When I'm fully focusing on what I'm doing, I'm efficient. But sometimes I take work home and then I also want to watch the shows which I missed last time -- they are on DVR now, all recorded.\n\nI'm trying to do my work and trying to pay attention to the show. What's going on? See, the work was supposed to take me two hours; it takes me about eight hours. And then I say, \"The whole weekend I was working.\" Anil, you were truly not working eight hours. So I am not efficient in my actions.\n\nWhen my actions are efficient, I should consider myself to be established in yoga. That was the prescription in the beginning. Bhagavan said Yogasthakura Karmani, establish yourself in yoga, have your mind steady and focused and work in this world. That's the way of life. That's why I say Hinduism teaches you what is the way of life. And succinctly told you how to be successful and happy in life.\n\nThe next few verses say, the one who now established in this yoga, he gives up all this Sukruta duskrita Buddhi yukto jahaati ha ubhe sukruta duskrita. Once you are completely focused in doing your best, you will not be affected by the results or whether it is a good or bad. You know you have done your best. You couldn't have done any better than this. The law of karma says the actions which you have put forth will bear results sooner or later. It does happen that sometimes I go to a client and make a presentation, and he doesn't give me the work.\n\nBut then he tells somebody else two years later, \"Why don't you talk to such and such? I thought he was pretty good.\" He didn't give me the job, but he refers me to somebody. And that third person comes and gives me a job. Because I put my efforts into the presentation to the first client, it eventually bore fruit -- but I don't make that connection.\n\nTherefore my mind cannot see why I'm getting this work but not that one. That's the law of karma. What I call it Prarabdha is not something completely random which is happening to my life but something happening in present. I cannot make a connection to my past actions. I call it my Prarabdha. So therefore Bhagavan says, one who acts in this world with that even mindedness he will be beyond sukruta duskrita.\n\nHe will be beyond good and bad. Many people used to say or still say doing good is good enough. Why do I have to worry about all these things? And Karma Yoga and this yoga just do good in life. Actually I remember Subhas Pahuja. He came to this class few times before he passed away.\n\nAnd his standard thing why do you have to learn Bhagavad Gita? I know doing good is good and I said that Bhagavan says doing good is not good enough. Why that good is Binding you, the expectation of good results and that becomes your golden chain. Every time I do good, I expect at least somebody will recognize. And our granddaughter, when she does something, she is looking around to see whether everybody is paying attention. Then if nobody pays attention, she herself says, \"Medha is so smart.\"\n\nThat's our true nature. We want recognition right from the childhood. We want to see around whether anybody's paying attention. Because I'm doing good but nobody's paying attention. What is good about that? So that good is binding me to good results in good vasanas but still vasanas.\n\nTherefore Bhagawan said, you will be relieved from both the good and bad if you focus on your actions only and not the results. Results are guaranteed. Something which is guaranteed, you don't have to worry about it. We know the sun will rise tomorrow. We don't have to agonize last night about what will happen tomorrow morning -- will the sun rise? We know it is guaranteed.\n\nResults of actions are guaranteed. And therefore you shouldn't be worried about that. Karmajam, budhiyuktahi, falam taktva, manishinah, janma, bandha, vinur muktaha, padam gachanti, anamayam. We are afraid of all the evils in this world which creates sorrows in our life. And Bhagavan said, the one who is established in this yoga and working in this world he will go beyond anamayam. He will go beyond all evils.\n\nKarma jam buddhiktahi falam kyakvam. Those wise one possessed of this knowledge who has given up the karma phala, given up in a sense given up the anxiety about karma phala. Whatever is in my way. They get janma, bandha, vinir muktaha. They get relieved from the cycles on birth and death. It's obviously very, very Hindu concept of the punar janma.\n\nBut even in this life, I take this position and then I take that position. Every position I take in this life is because of what? Because of my vasanas. I want to be a president of this, and I want to be the chairperson of that. I want to be on this board, I want to do this -- it is all driven by my vasanas, my egocentric desires.",
      "reflection": "Verse 49 declares: \"Physical action is far inferior to an intellect concentrated on the Divine. Have recourse then to Pure Intelligence. It is only the petty-minded who work for reward.\" Working merely for results is called \"inferior\" not because results do not matter, but because fixation on them diminishes both our peace of mind and our effectiveness. The term \"Kripanaha\" (misers or wretched ones) describes those who work only for fruits - they never truly enjoy even the success they achieve because they immediately start worrying about the next goal.\n\nVerse 50 gives another powerful definition: \"Spirituality is the real art of living\" (Yogah Karmasu Kaushalam - Yoga is skill in action). When the mind is equanimous and focused, actions become efficient and skillful. Think of any peak performance - an athlete in the zone, an artist in flow - the common factor is complete absorption in the action without anxious thinking about results. Verse 51 describes the fruit of this practice: \"The sages... freed from the chains of rebirth, they reach the highest bliss.\"\n\nTest this teaching practically: recall a time when you were fully absorbed in what you were doing, not worrying about how it would turn out. Notice the quality of that experience and the quality of your work. Now recall a time when you were anxious about results while working. How did that affect both your experience and your output? The Gita promises that skillful action naturally arises from equanimity. Today, experiment with bringing this focused, result-detached awareness to your tasks."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter two. We had been discussing verse 47 onwards, the most quoted verse in Bhagavad Gita, which is Karmani Vadikarastha. Between that verse 47 and verse 53, Bhagavan gives us concisely and succinctly how to live life. These scriptures give advice about how to live your life -- sometimes Hinduism is called a way of life. So from verse 47 onward, what we have seen is the reality of my life.\n\nReality of my life is: I am a living being, a conscious being, and therefore activity is what makes me who I am. I must be active. However, I must understand that the only thing which is in my control is my actions. The result of my actions are not in my control simply because there is infinite world out there that is the field of my actions. When I act in this field of my actions, the other forces affect the result of my actions which is not in my control. So I must keep the goal very high, which gives me the directions of my actions. So the goal gives us direction.\n\nBhagavad Gita did not say don't have any goal. It says Karmaniyeva adhikara ste ma faleshukadachan, not the fruits of action. It did not say don't keep any goal or don't plan anything in your life, just continue so keep the goal in your mind and then work accordingly. So the goal gives me direction in which direction I should put my actions. If I'm going from here to New York, I know one thing, I have to drive northward on 95, that my goal is to go to New York. It gives me direction which way to go, so I don't drive south.\n\nWhat it does not give me is what I will encounter on my way while I'm driving. I can generally predict that because I'm driving at 70 miles an hour and New York is 400 miles from here, it should take me about six hours. But the goal does not give me all the other information which might affect my reaching New York. Previously we didn't have any way to predict what's going to happen on the way, so we had to rely only on our general judgment. And there was some traffic news broadcast which would tell us what the traffic pattern was that day.\n\nThen we have now the gps. We're trying to add more and more ability to predict what is going to affect my travel. My GPS also tells me there is traffic congestion 25 miles from here and it will last for 8 miles. May delay for 15 minutes. So would you like to take a detour? Every time I try to follow my GPS agna to take detour, I'm actually more delayed than the 15 minutes that GPS predicted.\n\nBecause GPS does have some information but not all information. It had information on my main route but didn't really have all the information about the detour I would have to take. So I figured out that I better stay on the same course which I have started and decided upon. The point is that Karma Phala is dependent on not just one factor but many factors which we may not have control over. Therefore you should not be worried about the Karma Phala because it is not in your hand. Karma is your right, that's what is in your control.\n\nFind a direction, find a goal in life. Find a direction and work accordingly. Karma Phala may not be because what's going to encounter while you're working, you will not know. And therefore he said ma karma fala hatu bahu. Therefore do not make the fruits as the motivator. We'll reach New York in six hours.\n\nBecause I'm driving at 70 miles an hour, that should not be the motivating force of my driving. My motivation is I need to reach New York and it is in north. Therefore I'm driving northward. I will deal with whatever comes in my way. If I have to take a detour, I'll take a detour. But I will reach New York.\n\nI don't know, but I will reach there. But never get discouraged and say, oh, there is a lot of traffic today. Ma sanghatu akarmani. Do not get attached to inaction because you predict there may be a lot of obstructions on your way. So this is the prescription given to us. Have a goal, find a direction and then continue working.\n\nDo not worry about what you will encounter. So the next verse says Siddhi asiddhi samo bhatva Yogastha kurukarman. Establish yourself in yoga and then work. Now when I say yoga, I don't mean yoga classes -- Panditji keeps telling me to go, but I keep avoiding. So now I can't do anything about that.\n\nYogastha kurukarman means establish yourself into a state of mind where success and failure do not affect you. Say I have to go to New York but right near Ashland there's a huge traffic jam. That doesn't make me make a U-turn and come back home. My goal is to get there, to somehow find a way to get over this obstacle. Therefore he said siddhi asiddhi samo bhatva -- whatever comes in your way, take it equally.\n\nThis is still part of your life. So the yoga is samatvam Yoga uchate. I should be establishing myself in yoga. It's very simple: keep your mind even in whatever situation you encounter. In other words, keep that goal still in your mind. Don't let that obstruction in your way discourage you. Your goal is to achieve that infinite happiness. Don't get discouraged. Success and failure are part of your life because it is guaranteed that sometimes you will succeed, and most of the time you will fail. We used to track the statistics -- what is our hit rate on our proposals? For a while I did that because I was trained by my previous employers to track the hit rate.\n\nThen I said boy these hit rates look very poor. Let's not look at it, let's stop this thing. Just keep doing what you are doing because if you get discouraged by the results then you will stop acting. Goal is to achieve what you want to achieve. So Bhagawan said samatam yoga uchathe keep your mind equanimous in all situation with the success or failures. That's very necessary because failures are going to be there.\n\nAnd then when you work in that manner you will be applying your full focus and therefore you will be very efficient in your actions. So we saw the next definition of yoga's Yogaha Karma Sukhaoshalam. When do I consider myself to be established in the samatvam? My actions become efficient. We all know this. When I'm fully focusing on what I'm doing, I'm efficient. But sometimes I take work home and then I also want to watch the shows which I missed last time -- they are on DVR now, all recorded.\n\nI'm trying to do my work and trying to pay attention to the show. What's going on? See, the work was supposed to take me two hours; it takes me about eight hours. And then I say, \"The whole weekend I was working.\" Anil, you were truly not working eight hours. So I am not efficient in my actions.\n\nWhen my actions are efficient, I should consider myself to be established in yoga. That was the prescription in the beginning. Bhagavan said Yogasthakura Karmani, establish yourself in yoga, have your mind steady and focused and work in this world. That's the way of life. That's why I say Hinduism teaches you what is the way of life. And succinctly told you how to be successful and happy in life.\n\nThe next few verses say, the one who now established in this yoga, he gives up all this Sukruta duskrita Buddhi yukto jahaati ha ubhe sukruta duskrita. Once you are completely focused in doing your best, you will not be affected by the results or whether it is a good or bad. You know you have done your best. You couldn't have done any better than this. The law of karma says the actions which you have put forth will bear results sooner or later. It does happen that sometimes I go to a client and make a presentation, and he doesn't give me the work.\n\nBut then he tells somebody else two years later, \"Why don't you talk to such and such? I thought he was pretty good.\" He didn't give me the job, but he refers me to somebody. And that third person comes and gives me a job. Because I put my efforts into the presentation to the first client, it eventually bore fruit -- but I don't make that connection.\n\nTherefore my mind cannot see why I'm getting this work but not that one. That's the law of karma. What I call it Prarabdha is not something completely random which is happening to my life but something happening in present. I cannot make a connection to my past actions. I call it my Prarabdha. So therefore Bhagavan says, one who acts in this world with that even mindedness he will be beyond sukruta duskrita.\n\nHe will be beyond good and bad. Many people used to say or still say doing good is good enough. Why do I have to worry about all these things? And Karma Yoga and this yoga just do good in life. Actually I remember Subhas Pahuja. He came to this class few times before he passed away.\n\nAnd his standard thing why do you have to learn Bhagavad Gita? I know doing good is good and I said that Bhagavan says doing good is not good enough. Why that good is Binding you, the expectation of good results and that becomes your golden chain. Every time I do good, I expect at least somebody will recognize. And our granddaughter, when she does something, she is looking around to see whether everybody is paying attention. Then if nobody pays attention, she herself says, \"Medha is so smart.\"\n\nThat's our true nature. We want recognition right from the childhood. We want to see around whether anybody's paying attention. Because I'm doing good but nobody's paying attention. What is good about that? So that good is binding me to good results in good vasanas but still vasanas.\n\nTherefore Bhagawan said, you will be relieved from both the good and bad if you focus on your actions only and not the results. Results are guaranteed. Something which is guaranteed, you don't have to worry about it. We know the sun will rise tomorrow. We don't have to agonize last night about what will happen tomorrow morning -- will the sun rise? We know it is guaranteed.\n\nResults of actions are guaranteed. And therefore you shouldn't be worried about that. Karmajam, budhiyuktahi, falam taktva, manishinah, janma, bandha, vinur muktaha, padam gachanti, anamayam. We are afraid of all the evils in this world which creates sorrows in our life. And Bhagavan said, the one who is established in this yoga and working in this world he will go beyond anamayam. He will go beyond all evils.\n\nKarma jam buddhiktahi falam kyakvam. Those wise one possessed of this knowledge who has given up the karma phala, given up in a sense given up the anxiety about karma phala. Whatever is in my way. They get janma, bandha, vinir muktaha. They get relieved from the cycles on birth and death. It's obviously very, very Hindu concept of the punar janma.\n\nBut even in this life, I take this position and then I take that position. Every position I take in this life is because of what? Because of my vasanas. I want to be a president of this, and I want to be the chairperson of that. I want to be on this board, I want to do this -- it is all driven by my vasanas, my egocentric desires.",
      "reflection": "Verse 52 describes a sign of progress: \"When thy reason has crossed the entanglements of illusion, then shalt thou become indifferent both to the philosophies thou hast heard and to those thou mayest yet hear.\" At a certain stage, the seeker no longer needs to accumulate more information - they have moved from learning about truth to experiencing it directly. The teachings that once seemed so important become stepping stones now left behind.\n\nVerse 53 describes the goal: \"When the intellect, bewildered by the multiplicity of holy scripts, stands unperturbed in blissful contemplation of the Infinite, then hast thou attained Spirituality.\" The mind that was once confused by competing philosophies and practices becomes still and one-pointed. Then in verse 54, Arjuna asks the practical question that opens the final section of the chapter: \"How can we recognise the saint who has attained Pure Intellect... how does he talk, how does he live, and how does he act?\"\n\nThis question is crucial for us too. Having heard the theory, we want to know what it looks like in practice. Reflect today: Do you know anyone who embodies this teaching - someone who seems consistently peaceful regardless of circumstances, who acts with skill and dedication yet without visible anxiety about results? What qualities do you observe in them? Also ask: What would it look like if you had crossed \"the entanglements of illusion\"? How would your daily life be different? Let this vision inspire your practice."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter two, Sankhya Yoga, the Yoga of Knowledge. So far we have seen that this chapter is divided into four segments. In the first few verses, Arjuna says, \"I am Navirsheshya. I don't know what to do. You tell me without any option what is good for me.\" Second, we have seen how Bhagavan responded. He said, you shouldn't be worried about anything that is happening in this world simply because what you see happening is temporary.\n\nThere's nothing in this world which is permanent, because all your experiences are the senses coming in contact with the sense objects. That which you are worried about -- yourself -- is immortal. There is no death for it, there is no birth for it. So is the case for his self, her self, my self. Therefore there is no worry about the self. Everything else is temporary.\n\nSo why worry about that? That was the knowledge part. And then he said: how to practice that? Now, just knowing that does not make your life easier. Just because I went to Gita class does not make my life easier on Monday through Friday. What you should do is act just like you were acting before -- but establish yourself in yoga.\n\nYoga is the equanimity of mind. When you establish your mind in equanimity, things will continue to change outside, but I will remain the same in dealing with them, whether they are conducive or inconducive. Samatvam Yoga Uchate -- equanimity of mind is Yoga. When do I know that my mind is equanimous? When you become skillful in your actions.\n\nWhen your actions become crystallized and precise and efficient, you should know that you have established yourself in Yoga. Samatvam Yoga Uchate and Yoga Karmasu Kaushalam. So one is the definition, and there is actually a test. If your actions are haphazard, even though you think you are in yoga, you are not. Because a yogi's actions will be all precise and dexterous.\n\nMany times in my life I have seen this. Swami Chinmayananda says something that seems absolutely ridiculous, that it's not going to happen. Somehow it all falls into place. When I think from my logic, it should not work at all. But for him, if he says this should happen by this time and you should do this -- it happens. Because he has the mind of a yogi who can see through how to get things done.\n\nMine is the mind of a Bhogi who cannot see how this can ever happen. So Bhagavan said, that's your test. Yoga Karmasu Kaushalam. When we practice something over and over and over again, we become so efficient. I used to practice music. My teacher said, keep practicing.\n\nYou will get it before you even know when you got it. You will never know the exact moment when you mastered it. But then you will know what is the Madhya Sapta, the Mantra Sapta, the Taar Sapta. Practice makes you perfect. Once you achieve that art, you don't have to make any effort. Like driving -- that's Karmasu Kaushalam. I don't have to make any effort.\n\nI don't even think about it while driving. Because I have achieved Karmasu Kaushalam, I am established in the yoga of driving. Therefore, Bhagavan says, that's what equanimity of mind means. But we come to this conclusion very quickly that this is not possible -- this is just for yogis like Swami Chinmayananda and Buddha and Mahavir, not for us. So the question arises: okay, if that's the case, how do we know that someone is established in yoga?\n\nSo Arjuna asked the question about this Prajna which is Sthita -- whose intellect is steady. We saw the definition: Samatvam Yoga Uchate. Once one's intellect becomes steady, he becomes Sthita Prajna -- because that Prajna is not changing no matter what the outside situation is. It may be very dark in this room, but I know it is daytime. Because my prajna is sthita in the knowledge that it is daytime right now. Even if you turn off light, even if there is clouds outside and it becomes very dark, I still say it's daytime. Because I know it is daytime. Because my prajna is completely sthida in that knowledge. The knowledge which Bhagavan gave in the first section that you are not the mortal being, you are the immortal being. Your self is immortal.\n\nEverything else is just passing experiences. Once that knowledge takes place in the intellect, no matter what happens in my life, it does not change my understanding of that fact. If that happens to somebody who establishes himself in that knowledge, what is the description of such a person? How would I know such a person? So Arjuna in verse 54 asked that question.\n\nSthita Prajnasya Ka Bhasha Samadhisthasya Keshava. We know Samadhistha -- one who is established in Samadhi. Sama + Dhi: Buddhi which is steady. We use this word Samadhi in a very metaphysical way, but Samadhi is simply a firm conviction that this is the reality. In one Upanishad class we were told that you are in a complete state of Samadhi right now -- of your body consciousness.\n\nNobody has to remind me who I am. No matter what situation changes. Outside, it is dark, it is light. If everybody's here, nobody's here. This is me that never changes. You can convince me, if you are persuasive enough that this class does not exist.\n\nI am just hallucinating. \"Neil, you need some help. You are hallucinating. You're talking to yourself.\" It's possible that I will believe that and will start seeking advice. But you can't convince me that I don't exist.\n\nNo matter how confused I am, you can't convince me that I don't exist. But what Bhagavan is saying is that this self is actually immortal, not this body. So therefore you shouldn't be worried about death. Your samadhi should be in this immortality. So Arjuna asks: Bhagavan, how would that person who is established in the samadhi of his immortal self behave? His intellect is so steady that no matter what happens, he never loses that connection with that Samadhi.\n\nWhat is his description? To speak, Bhasa is describing. That's why the language is called Bhasha. Because we describe what we think through our speech. So what is his description of such a person? Swami Chinmayananda used to get this question all the time.\n\nSwamiji, are you realized? Swamiji, there is a conundrum here. If I tell you that I am realized, then what would you say? He tells everybody he's realized. Now if Swamiji says I'm not realized, why am I wasting time with you? If after all this, you are not realized, what am I going to get out of you?\n\nSo there is no way to find out one is realized or not. Only another Realized person will know who this realized person is, one who is a good singer. If somebody sings, he knows he's a good singer. For us, everybody is a good singer. But one who really knows music, he knows when the other person is doing well or not. So Arjuna said, how would I know that such a person exists?\n\nOr this can be achievable. Give me some description, give me some idea. And now all I can do is judge people by how they behave, right? I can't really go into their mind and say they are established in samadhi, but I can see from their behavior. Therefore, the second line says, sthita dihi Kim Prabhasheta Kim Asita Vrajeta Kim. This is indicative of knowing how a person with that level of establishment in Yoga will be behaving in this world.\n\nHow does he walk, how does he sit? Prabha cheta talk Kim Asita. How does he sit down and how does he walk? Basically, in indicative words, to know what would be his outward behavior. Now our problem is, once we know the outward behavior, somebody says, somebody will be sitting like this, somebody will be talking like that, somebody will be doing like that. Now we are trying to see that in a person and then basically come to the conclusion he is not.\n\nBecause he is not fitting into my description of how Sthita Pragna should be a muni. He should be sitting. So our idea of muni is sitting in Himalaya somewhere who is completely secluded from people, not interacting with people, not getting emotionally upset or emotionally charged with any situation. So we'll say, Swami Chinmayananda, I don't know. Swamiji still gets angry. And it says that Vitaraga Bhayakrodha is still angry.\n\nThe answer was, if I go to the ocean and try to see the ocean in a wave, and if I only see the characteristics of the wave, only thing I will see is the wave. Only never see the ocean in the wave, the wave its own characteristics. If I'm focusing on those characteristics, I only see wave in it. But if I see that the wave is nothing but the ocean rising and falling, I will see the ocean in it. So Arjuna wants to know, how do I know that a person like that exists? Tell me some description, give me some idea.\n\nHow will he behave in any situation? This is more like that bracelet these Christians have for the teenager, says wwjd what would Jesus do? This was, I think, a brilliant idea. Whoever came up with that, the teenagers, when they are in a dilemma, in some peer Press in school or whatever. What should I do when everybody's asking me to smoke? But my parents say you're not supposed to smoke.\n\nHe said, look at that person. WWJD what would Jesus do in this situation? How do I know what to do in a situation I'm encountering? How would a realized person would act in this situation? So the answer comes in the following verses till the end of the chapter. What a realized person will do in different situations.\n\nOnce your mind is steady, your excellence will be effortless. And then you will know in each situation how to react to that situation. Things and beings outside will continue to remain exactly as they are. As the Prakriti says, constantly changing. How would I react will change if my mind is equanimous. So that's basically the gist of this question.\n\nSo the answer is Prajahati Yada Kaman Sarvan Partha Manogatan. The first thing: who has given up all the desires? Sarvan Kaman Manogatan is the operative word -- desires born out of my mental agitations. One who gives up all the desires born out of the mind. What is our primordial desire? To be happy. I want to be comfortable and happy.\n\nBut out of this primordial desire to be happy, all other desires have come into this one. If I didn't have that desire to be happy and be okay with any situation, it looks like the guy is going to be a stone. A dead person who has no reaction to anything good or bad. It can only happen when I die. After I die, people can kick me. I'm fine, put me and throw me in a well.\n\nI'll be fine because I'm not there. But while I'm leaving, I'll be very careful. So they say, is that person be any different than all of us? However, he will be different from you in this following manner. Prajahati Yada Kaman Sarvan Manogatan. Right now I have decided that when I fulfill all these desires, I'll be happy. A realized person does not have those desires.\n\nThat does not mean that he does not become thirsty and won't have the desire to drink water. Actually, Swami Tejomayananda and others categorize all the desires and say: these desires which you can fulfill easily, don't even bother about them. Why are you suffering? That's not the Manogatan desires we are talking about.",
      "reflection": "Krishna's answer to \"What is a Sthitaprajna (person of steady wisdom)?\" begins here. Verse 55: \"When a man has given up the desires of his heart and is satisfied with the Self alone, be sure that he has reached the highest state.\" The key phrase is \"Manogatan\" - desires born from the mind, meaning fabricated wants rather than genuine needs. The Sthitaprajna is \"satisfied with the Self alone\" - finding completeness within rather than seeking it from external accomplishments or possessions.\n\nVerse 56 describes behavioral signs: \"The sage, whose mind is unruffled in suffering, whose desire is not roused by enjoyment, who is without attachment, anger or fear - take him to be one who stands at that lofty level.\" This is not suppression of emotions but their natural absence when one is fulfilled within. Verse 57 adds: \"He who wherever he goes is attached to no person and to no place... who accepts good and evil alike, neither welcoming the one nor shrinking from the other - take him to be one who is merged in the Infinite.\"\n\nExamine your own desires today. Which are genuine needs and which are \"Manogatan\" - fabricated by your mind, perhaps influenced by advertising, social comparison, or habit? Notice which desires, if fulfilled, would still leave you wanting more. The Sthitaprajna has discovered that no external acquisition brings lasting satisfaction - only recognizing one's inherent completeness does. As a practice, spend time today simply being - not doing, not acquiring, not accomplishing - and notice if you can touch a sense of sufficiency in that simple presence. This is the beginning of being \"satisfied with the Self alone.\""

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter two, Sankhya Yoga, the Yoga of Knowledge. We have seen so far that in verses 47 and 48, Bhagavan has given clear instruction about how to act in this world. Bhagavan said, Karmani eva adhikaraste ma phaleshu kadachana ma karma phala hetur bhur ma te sango'stv akarmani. Your right is only to act, never for the fruits -- never work for just getting the fruits, and also never get attached to inaction. But then he gave us a very positive message about how to act in this world: Yogastha kuru karmani sangam tyaktva Dhananjaya, siddhi asiddhi samo bhutva samatvam yoga uchyate.\n\nVery clear instruction: establish yourself in yoga. And then he defined yoga for us -- Samatvam Yoga Uchate, the balance of mind is yoga. You establish yourself in that state of mind where it is balanced. And then Sangam tyaktva, without any attachment, you act in this world. Siddhi asidhi samo bhatva be equal to success and failure. That is the total instruction for Karma Yoga.\n\nIf we remember just these two verses, then we have learned the entire message of Bhagavad Gita. Then people like us will say, \"Is that really all? Is this a watered-down version Bhagavan is giving me?\" And Arjuna probably felt the same way. So he uses two very familiar terms in the discussion of yoga -- terms Arjuna probably learned during his time at the Gurukul: Prajna and Samadhi. These two terms are elaborately described in Yoga Sutra. He uses those words in asking his questions.\n\nYou see, if that is the case -- if just balancing the mind is yoga -- then what are all these discussions about yogis who spend their lifetime practicing yoga? In Ashtanga Yoga, Samadhi comes at the final stage after years of practice. So he wanted to know: are we talking about the same yoga? So he asked Bhagavan: Sthita pragnasya ka bhasha samadhisthasya Keshava, sthita dhi kim prabhaseta kim asita vrajeta kim. In other words, he said, \"Okay, if that's the case, can you please explain to me what is the description of Sthita Prajna?\"\n\nPrajna means Consciousness. So Aitareya Upanishad says Prajnanam Brahma. We learned this in the four Mahavakyas -- this is the first Mahavakya. Consciousness is Brahman. Prajna is pure consciousness. One who is established in that is the Sthita Prajna.\n\nOne who is clearly identifying with the consciousness and not identifying with this BMI (Body, Mind, Intellect) is the Sthita Prajna. Arjuna says: if that is the case, can you please explain to me what is the description of that Sthita Prajna who is established in pure consciousness? And how is he Samadhisthasya -- established in Samadhi, constantly in the state of Samadhi? Samadhi is effortless awareness. Right now, we have effortless awareness about our own self as this limited being -- no effort is required for me to recognize \"this is me.\"\n\nFor that Sthita Prajna Yogi, no effort is required to realize that he is pure consciousness. Sthita Prajna who is established in Samadhi who recognizes that his self is nothing but consciousness. Describe to me that person. Is it same as what you described as Samatam Yoga? Uchad Sthita Dhi Kim Prabhasyeta Asyata Vrajeta.\n\nAnd what will be his behavior? Will he be different than what you and I see everybody else doing? So he wanted to clarify that we are talking about the same state of Sthita Prajna achieving through this Karma Yoga. This yoga which Bhagavan said is as simple as: continue doing what you are doing, but change your attitude -- you are not doing it for the fruits, but because it ought to be done. And then whatever the results come, accept them as Prasad. I will accept them whether success or failure, without having any judgment of my own.\n\nSo Bhagavan responded, the next verse which we have seen is verse 55. Bhagawan simply says Prajahati yada kaman Sarvan Parthumanogadan. One who gives up all the desires from the mind. In other words, he empties the mind. Atmaniyeva atmane tusta. One who is satisfied in the self by the self is Sthita Prajna.\n\nIt is as simple as that. One who has no desires, one who has completely emptied his mind, is a Sthita Prajna. So Bhagavan responded to Arjuna's question and described the Sthita Prajna. Very simple: one who has completely emptied his mind and is content, satisfied by the self in the self, is a Sthita Prajna -- which is not different from what Yoga Sutra describes as Yoga Chitta Vritti Nirodha. Yoga is the cessation of activities in Chitta.\n\nThis agitation in Chitta. As we have seen, Chitta is basically the total sum of mind, intellect, and Ahankar. When mind is not functioning with desires, intellect is not judging, and there is no sense of \"I the doer,\" then there is no Chitta Vritti. In the same way, Bhagawan said that when you empty your mind completely of all desires, then you become Sthita Prajna. The next question Arjuna had was then explain to me how will he behave in this world?\n\nBhagavan said Duhkheshu Anudvigna Manah -- he will not be agitated by Dukkha. His mind will not agitate when Dukkha comes, because he already anticipated that living in this world, Dukkha is bound to come. As Bhagavan Buddha figured out: Dukkha exists -- that's his first noble truth. Second, there's a cause for Dukkha, and if you remove the cause, Dukkha goes. So the Sthita Prajna, knowing this reality, remains undisturbed -- Duhkheshu Anudvigna Manah.\n\nHis mind doesn't agitate with Dukkha because it is something natural in this world. Sukesu vigathas pruhaha. When he encounters a conducive situation, he does not create more desires to experience that again and again and again, which is a typical case in our situation. Something which you like, you want to keep repeating it. Something which you don't like, we want to avoid it. Vitaraga Bhayakrodha when he becomes without any attachment, fear and anger.\n\nSo Bhagavan in these two verses already described what Arjuna asked for what is the description? Sthita Pragna is one without any desires in his mind. This is Sthita Pragna that simple. And secondly, how will he behave in this world? Well, he will behave very differently than a common man will behave. Common man gets agitated when Dukkha comes and gets all attached to Sukkah.\n\nContrary that this Muni will not be agitated by Dukkha and he will not long for this Sukkah to keep coming over and over again because he knows that that's not reality. It does not happen that way in this world. The remaining verses in chapter two basically elaborate on his answer. So Bhagavan is now elaborating on the description of Sthita pragna. Yaha Sarvatra Anabhis Neha Tattat prapya subu Asubham. So first thing he said.\n\nYa Sarvatra Anabhi Snaha. He is everywhere without Sneha. He avoids Sneha everywhere. Well, this doesn't sound good to us. Sneha is something we live for in our vernacular language. This word is very, very pleasant.\n\nIn Dear, Sneha is in olden days. I remember when I was a little kid. The letter writing was the only means of communication. We'll start with Bhai Rajesh, Tatha Anya Snehi Jana in Gujarati, Brother Rajesh and all others. All the people I'm attached to in the family Richmond Ni Yad from Richmond Nilkanti is remembering you all because I'm attached to you. So Snehi Jan I have attachment to.\n\nBhagavan says he is Yaha Sarvatra Anabisneha. He is not attached to anyone. So it's not a negative connotation. What it really means is he is equal to all. There is no partiality that I like this person. But I don't like that person.\n\nI mean indifferent to that, to that thing and attached to this thing. When I'm attached to everything then there is no differentiation between one or the other. I am attached to all limbs in my body. So it's not that I am attached to my right hand more than my left hand. Therefore he said Yasarvatra Anabhis Nehah. There is no partiality.\n\nBhagavan is equal to all because Bhagavan knows that this is just Me everywhere. In the same way, the Muni who is established in pure consciousness knows that there is no other reality than consciousness alone. Consciousness is Brahman. That Brahman is all-pervading, and the basis for all things and beings is consciousness. If I am that consciousness, there is no reason for me to get attached to one thing over another. Then Subham and Asubham will keep coming from Prakriti. It will go on as Prakriti is designed. So Subha and Asubha comes. When Subha comes, he does not congratulate himself. Again we have a problem here. Well, this is what we leave for we want congratulations. When something good happens, does this mean that I will not congratulate my son or a grandson or granddaughter who graduates from high school or college and celebrate? He does not go himself.\n\nSee, we typically congratulate ourselves when we succeed in something. Something good happens to us. I did this just before the great crash. I sold all my equity. We congratulate ourselves. Muni never congratulates himself.\n\nTat prapya subham na abhinandati. When Subham comes, he does not congratulate himself and say, good job, Neel. He knows that everything is possible because this consciousness is functioning through me and this world is functioning as per the laws of nature. And laws of nature include law of karma. I had done something good. Something good came to me.\n\nWhen Asubham comes, he does not hate himself. Our problem is either we like ourselves or we hate ourselves. It's not congratulating others to encourage our children, encourage our friends, encourage our relatives when they succeed. It is not that we tell them not to do something which is going to hurt them. They don't going to embrace things which are going to hurt. Don't go into a mass rally to get coronavirus infection.\n\nI don't hate coronavirus. That's not the intent. Intention here is to say when I continue to congratulate myself when I succeed and I hate myself when I fail, that has to stop. If my mind is empty, then this will not happen. Tashya prajna pratishtita. Such a person is established in consciousness.\n\nPrajna, as we have seen, is pure. Consciousness is prajna. The higher form of awareness is prajna. This is another way of looking at it. That that person will be always happy in whatever is happening. Neither he is congratulating himself nor is he hating himself.\n\nSuccess and failures come because of my past actions. I may have made mistakes. I may have done something good. Things are going to keep happening. Yada samharte kurmu angani iwas sarvasah. He lives a very intelligent life.\n\nHe does not put himself in danger, just as a tortoise detects danger and withdraws all its limbs under its shell to protect itself. He does not make himself vulnerable to perceived threats. When a Muni perceives there is a threat of getting attached to sense objects, he withdraws his senses. If something has a likelihood of getting me attached, I withdraw my senses from that. So there is no real reason for us to challenge ourselves and say, \"Let me see if even in that adverse situation I can maintain my composure.\"\n\nSo instead of meditating in my room where I have established myself, I'm going to go and meditate in a bar? Even though everybody is enjoying themselves, but I'll be meditating? Well, that's not a very smart way to live. Bhagavan said: the one who lives an intelligent life avoids things which are dangerous -- dangerous to my state of mind, which will agitate my mind. I may get attached, then I will have fear, and then I will have anger.\n\nI would rather not get into that situation.",
      "reflection": "The famous tortoise analogy appears in verse 58: \"He who can withdraw his senses from the attraction of their objects, as the tortoise draws his limbs within its shell - take it that such a one has attained Perfection.\" The tortoise does not destroy its limbs; it simply withdraws them when needed for protection. Similarly, the wise person does not eliminate the senses but learns to withdraw them from potentially harmful engagements.\n\nVerse 59 distinguishes mere abstinence from true transcendence: \"The objects of sense turn from him who is abstemious. Even the relish for them is lost in him who has seen the Truth.\" Willpower-based abstinence leaves the desire intact; true wisdom removes even the craving. And verse 60 offers a realistic warning: \"The mind of him, who is trying to conquer it, is forcibly carried away in spite of his efforts, by his tumultuous senses.\" Even sincere seekers find their senses overpowering at times.\n\nPractice sense-withdrawal today in small ways. When you feel the pull to check your phone, eat when not hungry, or engage in some habitual indulgence, pause and \"withdraw your limbs\" - simply choose not to act on the impulse and observe what happens. Notice: Does the urge intensify and then pass? Can you be comfortable with the sensation of wanting without fulfilling it? This builds the muscle of pratyahara (sense-withdrawal). Also observe if some desires have naturally fallen away in your life - things that once seemed essential but no longer interest you. This is the \"relish being lost\" that comes from growth."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 2, Sankhya Yoga, the Yoga of Knowledge. As we have seen, this chapter is in four parts and we are in the last part which describes the characteristics of a man of wisdom, a perfect person who has learned how to live in this life intelligently. This segment is called Sthita Prajna Lakshana -- basically a virtual role model created for us by Bhagavan Krishna, showing what a perfect person should be, how he acts in this world, and how he conducts himself. Bhagavan gave a very succinct definition of a Sthita Prajna.\n\nThe one who has emptied his mind of all desires, one who feels complete, he does not feel incomplete and therefore he does not have to acquire anything or accomplish anything to feel complete. So the person who has emptied his mind of all desires, he becomes Vita Raga Bhayakroda. He becomes devoid of any attachment, fear or anger. So that's basically a simple definition of a man of perfect wisdom, that he has no desire, he feels complete, he has no attachment, and therefore he has no fear and no anger. And then Bhagawan also described that what is that steady wisdom? What is that steady Buddhist which can make person achieve this state of having no attachment, fear and anger.\n\nAnd he said that one who does not get affected by any happening, whether conducive or unconducive -- he does not get agitated by unconducive happenings, and he also does not get carried away by conducive happenings. Conducive experiences do not create longing in him, and unconducive experiences do not create any grief or agitation in his mind. So this is basically a state of constant enthusiasm. He's constantly enthusiastic about living his life in a perfect state of mind.\n\nReminds me of my last boss, basically when I left my last office and started NBG architecture. He was a unique person, full of energy. Anytime I'll go to him and say, dan, we have a new project. He'll get excited, tell me what to do. He'll be always encouraging. But the unique thing was When I go to him and tell him that Dan, you know, we have a problem in this project.\n\nAnd somebody's going to file a claim against us for errors and omniscience. Some of the things which we always dread to go to your boss and tell him because he will be disappointed. How can you do this, Neil? On the contrary, Dan will be all enthusiastic. Okay, if that's the case, let's do this. Call such and such person.\n\nLet's make sure we do this enthusiasm in both cases I found very unique. He will not get upset because we have now a potential claim against us. But he will get all excited and say let's make sure that we are prepared to deal with it. I will never forget that. And it's now 20 years since I left the job. He now became the head of the entire organization which has 2100 people.\n\nThat shows what a person who can maintain his enthusiasm in all situations can achieve. In my own life, I've seen people achieving that. For one said that such a person, his intellect is steady. He does not get affected. His enthusiasm for acting in this world is not affected by the experience he is experiencing. So number one defined a role model.\n\nA man of perfect wisdom. So we come to the conclusion if we achieve that state, we got it made. We don't have to do anything after that. Bhagavan said, no, you have to be very careful. So then Bhagavan gives us a warning that be aware that your senses are very powerful. Indriyani Pramatini, Harati Prasabham Manaha.\n\nIt can take away the tranquility of mind. Because the very nature of senses is to go out and get impressions of all the objects. So what we know about objects is not really the actual nature of the object but what we have perceived about that object. That is the nature of senses. Those perceptions created on my mind. If my mind is not careful or it's not under the control of my intellect.\n\nThen it will get carried away again. And then it will lose its tranquility. So Bhagavan said, be careful. Therefore, a man of perfect wisdom moves around in this world like a tortoise that whenever it senses danger, withdraws all its limbs. So the man of perfect wisdom does not give up this world of plurality. He has to live in this world, but he lives with his senses under control of his mind. The mind is under the control of the intellect, and the senses are under the control of the mind. That is basically the state of perfect wisdom, as Bhagavan describes it. So he moves around in that fashion. That is what we have seen in the last two verses. And it says everything starts from constant contemplation on sense objects -- Dhyayato Visayan Pumsah. That is the root cause of all my troubles.\n\nWhen I constantly think about something, it becomes my nature. And once I attach myself to the world of finite objects, I'm going to assign my happiness to that object. I have now mortgaged my happiness to the world of objects. And therefore now I have to acquire them, because my happiness is mortgaged with them. Bhagawan said that is the ladder of fall. It starts with thinking about something, which creates attachment.\n\nThat attachment creates desires. The desires unfortunately creates anger. Anger created delusion. That delusion created loss of intellect. And loss of intellect gets you destroyed. So this is the fall which we have seen.\n\nSo that means I have to work with the root cause of my problem is Bhagavan Buddha in his Arya Satya. He says, the first Sathya is that Dukkha exists. There is Dukkha in this world. The second one is that there is a cause for Dukkha. And what is the cause for Dukkha? Desire is the cause for all Dukkha.\n\nSo Bhagavan says the same thing here. Dhyayato visayan pumsah -- contemplating sense objects is the cause for all the problems. So how do I live in this world? The next three verses describe how to avoid this danger, how to avoid falling from this ladder of fall.\n\nIt says Raga Dvesha Viyuktaihi Tu Visayan Indriyaih Charan Atma Vashyaih Vidheyatma Prasadam Adhigacchati. So, countering that tendency of thinking about objects and then getting attached to them and falling into that trap, he said: the man of wisdom has now realized, as we discussed last time, that attachment is a mental phenomenon. Because my mind gets impressions from the world of objects, it gets attached. Detachment, on the other hand, is a very intellectual pursuit. Knowing fully well that this attachment is going to create sorrows for me, I try to detach myself from those attachments. How do I detach myself?\n\nBhagavan says Raga Dvesha Viyuktaihi -- one who is devoid of likes and dislikes. Bhagavan has given us a pointer on how to become that. He said Tani Sarvani Samyamya Yukta Asita Matparaha. In verse 61 he said: here is the key. You will not be able to control your senses unless you have a higher goal. Turn your mind towards the higher goal. If that higher goal is engaging your mind, then the impressions coming from this world are not going to disturb it. When we are engrossed in doing something we are not aware of what's happening around us. Yukta, Asita, Matparaha. Have me in your mind all the time. Now that again sounds really ridiculous. Goal to have that my mind is always focused on Bhagavan.\n\nTherefore I cannot think of anything else. No -- actually, once you realize that, then nothing exists other than Me. Everything you see, you should see Me. Once I see all the objects are nothing but manifestations of the God. The impression of that object on my mind will be more divine than a finite image of that object. If you start seeing me in all things and beings then you will be able to control your mind.\n\nIf I see Bhagavan, the supreme being, in all things and beings, then the question of likes and dislikes really does not come. I cannot have one part of Bhagavan I don't like and another part of Bhagavan I like. That's truly not possible. We like everything about that being. Even his shortcomings -- we enjoy his shortcomings.\n\nBut a person we don't like -- even his good qualities we don't enjoy. So once we identify with that supreme self, all his manifestations we will enjoy them all as they are. Because we will not have any judgment about an individual manifestation. So Bhagavan says Sachapa Raga, Dwese Viuktahi. Person who has become devoid of likes and dislikes.\n\nVisayan Indre Charan. He moves around in this world of objects. Because there is no escape from this world of objects. We are part of this world and we have to live in this world. What do we want to achieve? We have to achieve within this world.\n\nBut how we act in this world is up to us. So I said one who is devoid of likes and dislikes. He is moving around with Atma Vashyahi, Vidhey Atma. He is self restrained. He is not getting carried away by one experience or the another. Vidheyatma, his self control.\n\nPrasadam Adhigacchati. He achieves that final result. And as we have discussed Prasad many times before, we are used to the word Prasad -- after every puja we have Prasad. That Prasad is always sweet, because it represents the fruits of all my good actions, sweet results. Here the result is tranquility of mind -- the mind is not getting any impression which is negative.\n\nNo matter what impression comes from outside, the mind sees a divine impression, and therefore it is in a state of tranquility. That is the Prasad -- that's the final reward. Then nothing can upset my mind. Bhagavan said such a person achieves Prasadam -- that final tranquility of mind that no experience can disturb.\n\nSo Bhagawan says: get out of likes and dislikes, see Me in everything, and then your mind will be constantly focused on Me. Prasade Sarva Dukkhanam Haanih Asya Upajayate -- this is where we started. I want to learn Bhagavad Gita because I need to get rid of all my Dukkhas.\n\nI want to get Bhagavan's Kripa because I want to get rid of all my sorrows and unhappiness. Bhagavan says there is a way to do it, and it is not My doing -- it is your doing. You have to do it yourself. When you control your mind, when you get out of likes and dislikes, then you will get the Prasad of your own actions -- the tranquility of mind. That tranquility of mind actually removes the cause for all your sorrows. Bhagavan Buddha said there is Dukkha, and there is a cause for Dukkha. All you have to do is remove the cause, and then you achieve that Kaivalyam. Prasade Sarva Dukkhanam -- by this Prasad, all Dukkhas get destroyed.\n\nPrasanna Chetasah Ashu Buddhih Paryavatishthate -- and for the one who is of tranquil mind, Chitta becomes Ekagra (one-pointed). As we have discussed, Chitta is a mirror which is reflecting all the impressions from outside. When all these impressions are divinized by my focusing on the divine self who created this cosmos out of his own self, the Chitta reflects nothing but the definitive reality.\n\nAs we have discussed before in this logic of causation: if this world exists, there must be a Creator. The Creator needs to have two causes -- efficient cause and material cause. He is the efficient cause because he knew how to create this world, but he also needed material, and the material is nothing but his own self.",
      "reflection": "Verse 61 gives the positive practice: \"Restraining them all, let him meditate steadfastly on Me; for who thus conquers his senses achieves perfection.\" The key is \"Matparaha\" - having a higher focus. Senses cannot be controlled merely through suppression; they need a superior attraction to draw them away from lesser objects. Focusing on the Divine provides this superior attraction.\n\nVerses 62-63 present the famous \"ladder of fall\" - the progression from contemplation of sense objects to complete destruction: \"When a man dwells on the objects of sense, he creates an attraction for them; attraction develops into desire, and desire breeds anger. Anger induces delusion; delusion, loss of memory; through loss of memory, reason is shattered; and loss of reason leads to destruction.\" Each step follows inevitably from the previous: thinking leads to attachment, attachment to desire, unfulfilled desire to anger, anger to confusion, confusion to forgetting what is truly important, and this to the destruction of discrimination itself.\n\nTrace this progression in your own experience. Think of a time when you became irrationally angry. Can you trace it back through desire and attachment to repeated contemplation of some object or outcome? Notice how anger clouds judgment and makes you forget your values and priorities. The teaching is clear: the problem starts with where you place your attention. Today, notice what you spend your mental energy contemplating. Is it building desire and potential frustration? Or is it supporting peace and wisdom? Attention is the beginning of the chain - guard it well."

So the person who has emptied his mind of all desires, he becomes Vita Raga Bhayakroda. He becomes devoid of any attachment, fear or anger. So that's basically a simple definition of a man of perfect wisdom, that he has no desire, he feels complete, he has no attachment, and therefore he has no fear and no anger. And then Bhagawan also described that what is that steady wisdom? What is that steady Buddhist which can make person achieve this state of having no attachment, fear and anger.\n\nAnd he said that one who does not get affected by any happening, whether conducive or unconducive -- he does not get agitated by unconducive happenings, and he also does not get carried away by conducive happenings. Conducive experiences do not create longing in him, and unconducive experiences do not create any grief or agitation in his mind. So this is basically a state of constant enthusiasm. He's constantly enthusiastic about living his life in a perfect state of mind.\n\nReminds me of my last boss, basically when I left my last office and started NBG architecture. He was a unique person, full of energy. Anytime I'll go to him and say, dan, we have a new project. He'll get excited, tell me what to do. He'll be always encouraging. But the unique thing was When I go to him and tell him that Dan, you know, we have a problem in this project.\n\nAnd somebody's going to file a claim against us for errors and omniscience. Some of the things which we always dread to go to your boss and tell him because he will be disappointed. How can you do this, Neil? On the contrary, Dan will be all enthusiastic. Okay, if that's the case, let's do this. Call such and such person.\n\nLet's make sure we do this enthusiasm in both cases I found very unique. He will not get upset because we have now a potential claim against us. But he will get all excited and say let's make sure that we are prepared to deal with it. I will never forget that. And it's now 20 years since I left the job. He now became the head of the entire organization which has 2100 people.\n\nThat shows what a person who can maintain his enthusiasm in all situations can achieve. In my own life, I've seen people achieving that. For one said that such a person, his intellect is steady. He does not get affected. His enthusiasm for acting in this world is not affected by the experience he is experiencing. So number one defined a role model.\n\nA man of perfect wisdom. So we come to the conclusion if we achieve that state, we got it made. We don't have to do anything after that. Bhagavan said, no, you have to be very careful. So then Bhagavan gives us a warning that be aware that your senses are very powerful. Indriyani Pramatini, Harati Prasabham Manaha.\n\nIt can take away the tranquility of mind. Because the very nature of senses is to go out and get impressions of all the objects. So what we know about objects is not really the actual nature of the object but what we have perceived about that object. That is the nature of senses. Those perceptions created on my mind. If my mind is not careful or it's not under the control of my intellect.\n\nThen it will get carried away again. And then it will lose its tranquility. So Bhagavan said, be careful. Therefore, a man of perfect wisdom moves around in this world like a tortoise that whenever it senses danger, withdraws all its limbs. So the man of perfect wisdom does not give up this world of plurality. He has to live in this world, but he lives with his senses under control of his mind. The mind is under the control of the intellect, and the senses are under the control of the mind. That is basically the state of perfect wisdom, as Bhagavan describes it. So he moves around in that fashion. That is what we have seen in the last two verses. And it says everything starts from constant contemplation on sense objects -- Dhyayato Visayan Pumsah. That is the root cause of all my troubles.\n\nWhen I constantly think about something, it becomes my nature. And once I attach myself to the world of finite objects, I'm going to assign my happiness to that object. I have now mortgaged my happiness to the world of objects. And therefore now I have to acquire them, because my happiness is mortgaged with them. Bhagawan said that is the ladder of fall. It starts with thinking about something, which creates attachment.\n\nThat attachment creates desires. The desires unfortunately creates anger. Anger created delusion. That delusion created loss of intellect. And loss of intellect gets you destroyed. So this is the fall which we have seen.\n\nSo that means I have to work with the root cause of my problem is Bhagavan Buddha in his Arya Satya. He says, the first Sathya is that Dukkha exists. There is Dukkha in this world. The second one is that there is a cause for Dukkha. And what is the cause for Dukkha? Desire is the cause for all Dukkha.\n\nSo Bhagavan says the same thing here. Dhyayato visayan pumsah -- contemplating sense objects is the cause for all the problems. So how do I live in this world? The next three verses describe how to avoid this danger, how to avoid falling from this ladder of fall.\n\nIt says Raga Dvesha Viyuktaihi Tu Visayan Indriyaih Charan Atma Vashyaih Vidheyatma Prasadam Adhigacchati. So, countering that tendency of thinking about objects and then getting attached to them and falling into that trap, he said: the man of wisdom has now realized, as we discussed last time, that attachment is a mental phenomenon. Because my mind gets impressions from the world of objects, it gets attached. Detachment, on the other hand, is a very intellectual pursuit. Knowing fully well that this attachment is going to create sorrows for me, I try to detach myself from those attachments. How do I detach myself?\n\nBhagavan says Raga Dvesha Viyuktaihi -- one who is devoid of likes and dislikes. Bhagavan has given us a pointer on how to become that. He said Tani Sarvani Samyamya Yukta Asita Matparaha. In verse 61 he said: here is the key. You will not be able to control your senses unless you have a higher goal. Turn your mind towards the higher goal. If that higher goal is engaging your mind, then the impressions coming from this world are not going to disturb it. When we are engrossed in doing something we are not aware of what's happening around us. Yukta, Asita, Matparaha. Have me in your mind all the time. Now that again sounds really ridiculous. Goal to have that my mind is always focused on Bhagavan.\n\nTherefore I cannot think of anything else. No -- actually, once you realize that, then nothing exists other than Me. Everything you see, you should see Me. Once I see all the objects are nothing but manifestations of the God. The impression of that object on my mind will be more divine than a finite image of that object. If you start seeing me in all things and beings then you will be able to control your mind.\n\nIf I see Bhagavan, the supreme being, in all things and beings, then the question of likes and dislikes really does not come. I cannot have one part of Bhagavan I don't like and another part of Bhagavan I like. That's truly not possible. We like everything about that being. Even his shortcomings -- we enjoy his shortcomings.\n\nBut a person we don't like -- even his good qualities we don't enjoy. So once we identify with that supreme self, all his manifestations we will enjoy them all as they are. Because we will not have any judgment about an individual manifestation. So Bhagavan says Sachapa Raga, Dwese Viuktahi. Person who has become devoid of likes and dislikes.\n\nVisayan Indre Charan. He moves around in this world of objects. Because there is no escape from this world of objects. We are part of this world and we have to live in this world. What do we want to achieve? We have to achieve within this world.\n\nBut how we act in this world is up to us. So I said one who is devoid of likes and dislikes. He is moving around with Atma Vashyahi, Vidhey Atma. He is self restrained. He is not getting carried away by one experience or the another. Vidheyatma, his self control.\n\nPrasadam Adhigacchati. He achieves that final result. And as we have discussed Prasad many times before, we are used to the word Prasad -- after every puja we have Prasad. That Prasad is always sweet, because it represents the fruits of all my good actions, sweet results. Here the result is tranquility of mind -- the mind is not getting any impression which is negative.\n\nNo matter what impression comes from outside, the mind sees a divine impression, and therefore it is in a state of tranquility. That is the Prasad -- that's the final reward. Then nothing can upset my mind. Bhagavan said such a person achieves Prasadam -- that final tranquility of mind that no experience can disturb.\n\nSo Bhagawan says: get out of likes and dislikes, see Me in everything, and then your mind will be constantly focused on Me. Prasade Sarva Dukkhanam Haanih Asya Upajayate -- this is where we started. I want to learn Bhagavad Gita because I need to get rid of all my Dukkhas.\n\nI want to get Bhagavan's Kripa because I want to get rid of all my sorrows and unhappiness. Bhagavan says there is a way to do it, and it is not My doing -- it is your doing. You have to do it yourself. When you control your mind, when you get out of likes and dislikes, then you will get the Prasad of your own actions -- the tranquility of mind. That tranquility of mind actually removes the cause for all your sorrows. Bhagavan Buddha said there is Dukkha, and there is a cause for Dukkha. All you have to do is remove the cause, and then you achieve that Kaivalyam. Prasade Sarva Dukkhanam -- by this Prasad, all Dukkhas get destroyed.\n\nPrasanna Chetasah Ashu Buddhih Paryavatishthate -- and for the one who is of tranquil mind, Chitta becomes Ekagra (one-pointed). As we have discussed, Chitta is a mirror which is reflecting all the impressions from outside. When all these impressions are divinized by my focusing on the divine self who created this cosmos out of his own self, the Chitta reflects nothing but the definitive reality.\n\nAs we have discussed before in this logic of causation: if this world exists, there must be a Creator. The Creator needs to have two causes -- efficient cause and material cause. He is the efficient cause because he knew how to create this world, but he also needed material, and the material is nothing but his own self.",
      "reflection": "Verse 64 presents the positive alternative to the ladder of fall: \"The self-controlled soul, who moves amongst sense objects, free from either attachment or repulsion, he wins eternal Peace.\" Note that the solution is not avoiding sense objects (impossible in worldly life) but engaging with them without Raga (attraction) or Dvesha (repulsion). The key is \"Vidheyatma\" - one whose self is disciplined.\n\nVerse 65 describes the reward: \"Having attained Peace, he becomes free from misery; for when the mind gains peace, right discrimination follows.\" Peace enables clear thinking, which reinforces peace - a virtuous cycle. But verse 66 warns of the opposite spiral: \"Right discrimination is not for him who cannot concentrate. Without concentration, there cannot be meditation; he who cannot meditate must not expect peace; and without peace, how can anyone expect happiness?\"\n\nThis teaching creates a clear roadmap. Start with reducing likes and dislikes - practice equanimity toward pleasant and unpleasant experiences. This enables concentration. Concentration enables meditation (sustained focus). Meditation brings peace. Peace brings happiness. Today, practice engaging with something you typically dislike or avoid with an attitude of neutrality - not forcing yourself to like it, just dropping the active dislike. Similarly, engage with something you typically crave with a bit more detachment. This \"Raga-Dvesha Vimuktaihi\" (freedom from attraction and repulsion) is the practical beginning of the path to lasting peace."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 2, Sankhya Yoga, the Yoga of Knowledge. Bhagavan gave us a roadmap for our journey from ignorance about ourselves to the knowledge of the Supreme. We have seen this step by step. How can I come out of this ignorance about myself? Right now I consider this body as me, this mind as me, this intellect as me. Ideas such as \"I think, therefore I am\" create attachment to my mind and my intellect.\n\nAnd this body serves as my vehicle for all my experiences in this world, which creates attachment to it. Therefore I consider the death of this body to be my death. I have not seen anybody coming back after he dies, so I conclude the death of this body is my death. But Bhagavan said, dehino'smin yatha dehe kaumaram yauvanam jara tatha dehantara praptir dhiras tatra na muhyati. Just as you have seen changes in your life from childhood to youth to old age, you should not be confused by the transition to another body.\n\nYou have seen in your journey various states of existence. You existed as a child, as a youth, and also as an old man. Now he said, you're not confused by that, that does not delude you. These experiences which are different from each other has never confused you, who you are. You always consider, this is me. When I say I, it remains same no matter what state I was in, whether I was a child, a young man or an old man.\n\nSince those changes in this life did not confuse you about who you are, the change to another body also should not confuse you. This is a hypothesis for us now because we do not have direct experience of it. But the idea of reincarnation was introduced to us: that this life is not the only life. You lived many lives before, where you created all your vasanas and tendencies. I have a tendency to be artistic, somebody else has a tendency to be athletic, another person is more intellectual. Where are all these tendencies coming from? Bhagavan said these tendencies come from your experiences in past lives, before you were even born in this body. And then he basically said that this journey is one of activity. In this journey you have to be active all your life. Then the question is: how do I act in this world? Bhagavan said, sukha duhkhe same kritva labha alabha jayajayau, tato yuddhaya yujyasva -- with a balanced mind you should act in this world. That's basically simple advice Bhagavan gave. Samatvam Yoga Uchate. Create balance in your mind in all the various experiences you're experiencing. And then you will be on your path to your destination. Your destination is to find perfect happiness.\n\nBhagawan said you will find that if you act in this world with a balanced mind. Then my question is: how do I keep a balanced mind with varied experiences in my life? And Bhagawan said Yukta Asita Matparaha. Keep an overarching goal which encompasses everything -- all your experiences, all your feelings, and all your thoughts.\n\nThen you will be able to balance your mind. If you have an overarching goal, then that goal becomes the destination. The goal will be reflected in all your experiences. We have all experienced that when you are in love, when you are fixated with one object, you see that in everything. When you fall in love, you see that person.\n\nIn all other persons you see -- \"that must be her, that must be him.\" Because my mind is so overpowered by that goal that I see everything in it. When I become a father or mother for the first time, in all children I see my child. Then when I first become a grandfather, I see my granddaughter and grandson in all children. Because whatever is taking over your mind, you will reflect that in all your experiences.\n\nIf your mind is focused on Me, if I am your supreme goal, then I will be reflected in all your experiences. Everything I see, I will see His manifestation. Everything I hear, I will hear His voice, His flute in that sound. So everything will become divine. The experience may be anything, but now my mind will not assign any value other than a divine value to it.\n\nBhagavan said Yukta Asita Matparaha -- but to become Yukta, to be established in that union, Bhagavan says Tani Sarvani Samyamya, you must control all your senses. Vashe hi yasya indriyani -- one who has the senses under control. Tasya prajna pratishtita -- his wisdom is steady. What he's seeing is what is truly there to be seen. When my wisdom is steady and my mind is balanced, I'm seeing reality. If my wisdom is not steady, if I assign different values to different things based on my likes and dislikes, then my wisdom is not steady.\n\nThe result of that would be that I will not have any Sukha, I will not be at peace. So the last verse which we discussed says Nasti buddhir ayuktasya. One who has no overarching goal is Ayukta. Yukta is one who is identified with the supreme goal. My supreme goal should be having Sukha and no Dukkha. That overarching goal in my life is to avoid Dukkha and have only ultimate happiness. That happens when you are identified with the supreme self. Bhagavan says, the one who is not identified with the supreme goal is Ayukta. He has no fixed goal, so anything will become his goal. Whatever experience I have, I'll be attached to it, and then I will not know where my happiness truly lies. It is something like when I was in India or in Africa -- there were only a few choices, like two or three: Kesar, Pista, or Kajudraks ice cream. When I went to Law Garden in Ahmedabad, the choices were very clear, not really a big question mark. But I come here and Baskin Robbins has 31 flavors. Now how do I know which flavor is best? If I taste all 31 of them, by the time I get to the 31st flavor, I forget what the first flavor tasted like. I would have to start all over again. So I really have no clue where my happiness lies.\n\nBecause every time I taste something, I think that's it. And then I say, but there are 30 other flavors. I need to try them also. Maybe there is one better than this. So Bhagavan said, one who is Ayukta -- who does not have this fixed goal of what he is trying to achieve -- he will not have any Buddhi. Nasti buddhir ayuktasya. He does not have the wisdom to know what his goal is and where his happiness lies. He also does not have any firm identification; his identification shifts from one goal to another. In one who is not identified with one goal, how can there be any peace? His mind is agitated. Even when I'm achieving something, I think, \"This may not be it. There may be other things which other people are getting that I'm not getting. I should be going after them. I may be missing out on something.\" So Bhagavan said, na cabhavayatah shantih.\n\nOne who does not have identification with his goal has no Shanti. And ashantasya kutah sukham -- for the one who is agitated, where is happiness? We all know this: when the mind is agitated, there is no Sukha. Sukha I only experience when there is no agitating thought in my mind. Swamiji used to say: \"I\" minus \"I want\" equals happiness. As long as there is \"I want,\" there cannot be any happiness. As long as I'm wanting something, there cannot be any peace in my mind, because there's agitation -- \"I don't have it. I must be doing something which is not right. Or I may not be doing something which I should be doing now.\" Those thoughts create ashanti.\n\nSuch a person cannot have Sukham. If your goal is to achieve Sukha, you need to quieten your mind. And then Bhagavan explains why it is very important that you start with controlling your senses, which we have seen earlier. Dhyayato visayan pumsah -- if I let my senses get impressions of the sense objects, then I keep thinking about them, and then I'll fall down that ladder of fall. So it says Indriyanam hi charatam yan mano'nuvidhiyate -- if my mind follows the wandering senses. Senses are involuntarily going out and getting impressions of the objects they are contacting. If I keep my eyes open and see outside the window, there will be an impression of what's outside. But what I actually see depends on the disposition of my mind. For example, I see my friend Omi Narayan every day posting pictures of birds or flowers on his Facebook. But when I look outside, I see buildings. I say, \"Well, that guy's house looks nice, but I think it could have been designed a little better than this.\" So the disposition of my mind is to see the built world, not the natural world, even though we're both looking outside. The senses are involuntarily going out there and getting impressions of these sense objects.\n\nIt is the mind which creates meaning from those impressions. Indriyanam hi charatam -- these wandering senses go out, and if the mind follows these wandering senses, getting attached to each object it perceives and wanting to keep thinking about it, then tadasya harati prajnam -- it carries away his wisdom. Now he obviously does not have the discrimination to know what is right and what is wrong for him, what to accept and what to reject. A picture is worth a thousand words, so Bhagavan gives this image: just as a boat on the waters with no controller, no boatman, just a boat by itself -- it will be tossed by the wind.\n\nWherever the wind takes it, it will go. There is no fixed destination. If your mind follows every object which is perceived through the senses, then it will be tossed from one object to another. It does not have a goal and therefore it does not have any destination. My destination was happiness, but I lost my way because I have not fixed my destination. I do not know where to go. I am just driving but do not know where I am going. And then Bhagavan says Tasmad yasya mahabaho -- therefore, O Mighty-Armed. Bhagawan gives Arjuna a little boost of courage: you are capable of doing this, of controlling your senses. Nigrihitani Sarvashah Indriyani Indriyarthebhyah. Therefore, one who has controlled all his senses from the sense objects -- Tasya Prajna Pratishtita -- his wisdom is steady.\n\nThis is a very difficult verse to understand because we think it is impossible -- impossible to not have any perception of this world outside. The very job of senses is to perceive the world outside. If my mind is completely inert and is not getting any impression, then I'll be basically a dead person. Swamiji says, \"If that's the case, if you're not perceiving anything, just let us know and we'll do your last rites.\" So if that's what it means, it is not possible for us to do that.\n\nThe very nature of senses is to get impressions in the very nature of mind is to get attached to those impressions. But what I will see as my mind depends on the disposition of my mind. If I have already fixed a goal that my goal is to have ultimate happiness and therefore I have to fix my mind on the ultimate self, then I will see the manifestation of that self in everything which I hear, I taste, I touch. So the people who are bhakta, when they listen to music, they see Krishna Bhakti in it. To them the music is for achieving God's Bhakti. Otherwise I sing film songs and it has different emotions in it.",
      "reflection": "Verse 67 uses a powerful image: \"As a ship at sea is tossed by the tempest, so the reason is carried away by the mind when preyed upon by straying senses.\" Without mastery over the senses, even a wise person's discrimination can be swept away. The senses wander naturally toward their objects; if the mind follows them, wisdom is lost like a rudderless boat in a storm.\n\nVerse 68 restates the requirement: \"He who keeps his senses detached from their objects - take it that his reason is purified.\" And verse 69 offers a striking paradox: \"The saint is awake when the world sleeps, and he ignores that for which the world lives.\" What ordinary people consider most real and important (sense pleasures, worldly success), the sage sees as relatively unreal - like being asleep to the deeper truth. Conversely, what the sage is awake to (the Self, the eternal) seems like nothing to ordinary perception.\n\nThis is an invitation to examine your own \"sleep\" and \"wakefulness.\" What consumes your attention and energy? Is it what the verse calls the world's concerns, or something deeper? Try this contemplation: Imagine looking back at your current life from your deathbed. What that you now pursue will seem important then? What will seem like sleep-walking through life? The sage is awake now to what will matter then. Today, try to stay \"awake\" to what is truly significant amid the distractions that normally capture your attention."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 2, Sankhya Yoga, the Yoga of Knowledge. We are coming to the end of chapter two, and we will be discussing the last three verses today, then we'll move on to chapter three, Karma Yoga, the Yoga of Action. What we have learned so far in chapter two is essentially the whole summary of Bhagavad Gita -- all the ideas and the basic philosophy of Bhagavad Gita are summarized in chapter two. The most important verse in the first section was verse 7, where Arjuna said, karpanya doshopahatah svabhavah -- my nature is overwhelmed by the taint of miserliness or weakness, and I do not know what is right and wrong for me. I don't know what is my Dharma.\n\nDharma sammudha chetasah -- my Buddhi does not tell me right now what is my right Dharma at this time. Shishyas te'ham -- so he admits: I need guidance. I need someone to tell me what is right. Therefore, tell me definitively, without any wavering, what is right for me. So the first section gives us a condition we sometimes face in life: we are completely overwhelmed by the situation and we cannot see what is right and wrong for us. But where we differ from Arjuna is that our ego doesn't give us that humility to say, \"I'm completely confused, I am your student, please guide me.\" Even at the point of confusion and delusion, we try to hang on to our ego and try to solve our problems ourselves. And therefore we can't see how to get out of this problem.\n\nBecause we are in the problem, we need to surrender to someone who can see it from outside, have complete faith in his advice and guidance, and say, \"I'm going to follow whatever you tell me, just tell me.\" But what we typically do is carry our ego to whoever we are seeking advice from. We say, \"Look, okay, but what does he know? My problem only I know.\" That's why we fail to get the benefit of advice. So Bhagavan did not say anything in chapter one because he didn't see that Arjuna was ready yet. Swamiji says, giving advice to the wrong person at the wrong time can do more harm than help. If somebody is not ready to take the advice and you say, \"Let me tell you, my son\" -- he has to be ready before you can tell him what is right for him. So the first thing we have seen is that when you reach a point of complete confusion in your life, you have to surrender. In this case, if nothing else, surrender to your own conscience, which is Bhagavan, and say, \"Give me guidance.\"\n\nTell me, I don't know. My intellect cannot come to the conclusion of what is right or wrong. And then we have seen all the guidance Bhagavan gave. He first changes Arjuna's paradigm of what he thinks he is. You are not who you think you are. This limited being which you have considered yourself to be is not really you. This is just your equipment. This body, mind, and intellect which I currently consider to be me is actually nothing but my equipment. So if I can realize that this is something which is mine and cannot be me, then I will be able to realize who I truly am and get the benefit of that wisdom. So Bhagavan changed his paradigm and said: you are that imperishable being. And then we have seen the explanation -- just as you change your clothes, you will change the body as well, but you remain the same.\n\nJust as you changed from childhood to youth to old age, from this life you'll move on to the next life. The advice given by Bhagavan in verse 38 is how to live life: Sukha duhkhe same kritva labhalabho jayajayau, tato yuddhaya yujyasva naivam papam avapsyasi. Here is how you should live your life: not a life of inaction, not a life of complete detachment from your duties, but complete detachment from what's happening to you. Have that understanding that all things are transitory, finite in nature and in time-space. So sukha duhkhe same kritva -- you remain the same whether experiencing sukha or duhkha. I will still experience them differently -- one will be pleasurable, one will be painful. But I experience both while keeping in mind that this is just a passing phase, a finite experience.\n\nHow do I keep my balance? Victory and defeat in our life -- we are constantly winning and losing. We're winning an argument, we are winning a negotiation, we are losing a deal. Marketing people teach you that everyone is selling something. You may not consider yourself a salesman, but you are selling something to somebody -- selling your idea to your spouse about which vacation to take. You have to sell your idea first. So you're constantly selling and marketing and winning and losing in life, and you need to keep your balance. Just as you don't really get upset when you lose your argument within the family -- sometimes we do, but you're not supposed to because you understand we are still one family -- in the same way, when I lose or win out in the world, I should have the same equanimity. Others are going to win sometimes. The law of probability tells me I cannot have 100% success. As I told you, in our industry we ask, what is the hit rate -- how many proposals are submitted and how many have we won? Now that hit rate is not really entirely dependent on you; it's partly the law of probabilities.\n\nI know if I submit 10 proposals, I'll win at least one of them. It is a law of probability. So I have to be prepared nine times to be disappointed that somebody else was better than me. But that one time when I win, I'm so ecstatic -- \"I am the best.\" The other nine times, I will be miserable. But no -- you have to be the same in all 10 times. Bhagavan said the operative word is: you just engage in this battle of life. You can't run away from it. And there's a guarantee -- you will not incur any sin in doing your duty with this attitude. No matter what the outcome is, you are not incurring any wrong impressions on your mind. And then the last section we have seen is the Sthita Prajna. In the end, Arjuna said, if someone achieves this, how do I recognize him? So verse 55 gives a short definition: prajahati yada kaman sarvan partha manogatan, atmany evatmana tushtah sthitaprajnas tadochyate.\n\nHow do I become that person who is in a blissful mood all the time? Because you are saying yuddhaya yujyasva -- you want me to engage in the battle. Typically what we say is, \"This is too painful an environment. I need to leave this environment.\" Bhagavan said no, you can't leave. It's part of your duty. You have to engage yourself in this battle of life and still remain equanimous, stable, blissful. How? He said Prajahati yada kaman sarvan manogatan. He didn't say to give up all desires. Desires cannot go away completely. Manogatan means fabricated by my mind -- something which I really don't need but I think I have to have.\n\nOne thing I learned in all the training we go through in the corporate world -- one of the trainings I did was \"Negotiate to Win.\" They have an exercise about Honest Abdullah's shop in Pakistan, and you are an American tourist going to negotiate for an antique piece. The first thing the American does is say, \"Oh that's great, I got to have it.\" Once Abdullah hears \"I got to have it,\" he knows he's got you, and then he's going to start from the highest price he can imagine, then come down slightly, and you think you have done well. But if you're from India, what do you do? \"Well, I really don't need it, but I think, you know, I'm here.\" Meena and I went to India last time at one of these historical places, and she said, \"I can buy it, but I don't really have space for this in my bag, so I can't really buy it. But if you give it to me for this price, I'll buy it.\" The guy said, \"So if I give you the lower price, you'll have space in your bag?\" She said, \"No, I can only buy -- okay, I don't have space in my bag.\" So we worked the other way around: \"I really don't need it, but if you want to give it to me at that price, okay.\" So this is Manogatan -- desires fabricated by my mind. If I give up all the desires which are fabricated by my mind -- not my genuine needs -- that's the key. I have a desire to fulfill my needs: I'm thirsty and I want a glass of water, that is one thing. But if I have to buy a Perrier just because it's a status symbol, well, that's my Manogatan desire. So Bhagavan said that if you give up all the Manogatan desires and just be happy with whatever you come across.\n\nAtmany evatmana tushtah. Fulfilling my desires is not giving me happiness or joy -- it is just fulfilling my needs. But I am always satisfied in myself, by myself, with who I am and where I am. Atmany evatmana tushtah sthitaprajnas tadochyate. That is the definition of Sthita Prajna. Not that he is not working in this world, or that he is a sanyasi in the Himalayas. He is working in this world but is satisfied in himself, where he is. He is not getting jealous by reading Forbes magazine -- \"All these people are making all this money and what am I doing here?\" When I am not disturbed by the outside world, that outside world cannot create unnecessary desires in my mind.\n\nThen I am a Sthita Prajna. So we have gone through the whole characteristics of the Sthita Prajna -- he works in this world in a very intelligent way. That's an intelligent way of living. He does not live life in a chaotic way, whereas we live life somewhat prompted by our instincts. We go to the mall with no plan to buy X, Y, or Z. But just because I'm there and I see something, I keep saying, \"Maybe I need that, maybe I should have that because it's on sale.\" That's because I never really defined what will make me happy. So what does the Sthita Prajna do? He lives an intelligent life. He does not expose himself to those temptations. As soon as he sees there are temptations, he withdraws his senses, like the tortoise. So he's always protecting himself from getting undue impressions which are not necessary. And that's how he lives an intelligent life, maintaining his state of equanimity. And then the last four verses tell us the difference between us and him. Right now I'm completely aware of the world of objects. And there are myriads of objects in this world. And I'm seeking happiness in those objects, constantly planning how can I get happiness from them.",
      "reflection": "The chapter concludes with the beautiful ocean analogy in verse 70: \"He attains Peace, into whom desires flow as rivers into the ocean, which though brimming with water remains ever the same; not he whom desire carries away.\" The ocean receives all rivers yet remains unchanged - full but not overflowing, deep and still. Similarly, experiences and desires come to the sage but do not disturb his fundamental peace. He is already full.\n\nVerse 71 summarizes the path: \"He attains Peace who, giving up desire, moves through the world without aspiration, possessing nothing which he can call his own, and free from pride.\" Three qualities: Nishprihaha (without craving), Nirmamaha (without \"mine-ness\"), and Nirahankaraha (without ego). And the final verse 72 declares: \"This is the state of the Self, the Supreme Spirit, to which if a man once attain, it shall never be taken from him. Even at the time of leaving the body, he will remain firmly enthroned there, and will become one with the Eternal.\"\n\nAs Chapter 2 ends, reflect on its complete teaching: You are not the body but the eternal Self. Perform your duty without attachment to results. Cultivate equanimity toward pleasure and pain. Control the senses through higher focus. Free yourself from the tyranny of likes and dislikes. Become like the ocean - full within yourself, receiving all experiences without being disturbed. Today, choose one of these teachings to focus on. Which resonates most with your current situation? That is your entry point into the practical wisdom of the Gita."

      ],
      "commentary": "We have completed chapter two, Sankhya Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge, in which we have seen that in the beginning Arjuna was confused about his duties. He wanted to act according to his Dharma, but he wasn't sure what is his Dharma. So he argued first that maybe I should not take part in this war because I don't want to be the cause for all the consequences of this bad war. And then obviously he put for all his arguments, seeking endorsement from Krishna, that yeah, that's the right thing to do, let's stop this war. You run away and we'll be fine. Well, Krishna did not endorse his ideas and actually asked him to do his duties as the commander of the army, the Kshatriya.\n\nTo explain why Arjuna should fight, Krishna gave him a true thumbnail picture of who we are and how you should look at the world. So in the beginning he told him about what the self is, that this self is immutable, imperishable, only the body dies, and therefore you should not grieve about anybody dying. And then he continued telling him why he should continue his duty in this world. But then Arjuna asked, is there any person who can be such established in this knowledge that he is equanimous? In the end we have seen that a man of a steady wisdom, how he lives his life in a very intelligent way, that he does not get affected by all the attractions of this objective world. So he always keeps his senses under control and remain equanimous mentally in all situations.\n\nAnd therefore Bhagavan said, you go ahead and act in this world, keeping your mind and intellect equanimous in all situations. Now this seems very simple and clear to us, but Arjuna, who was truly in that dilemma of what is right, I want to do my Dharma, but I don't know which one is right. This whole discourse about what the self is all about obviously did not make it very clear to Arjuna. So the chapter three, titled Karma Yoga, Yoga of Action, now elaborates upon what is action and how you should work in this world. You have to work in this world because we are all working. But if we find out how to act, maybe we can have better results, because right now we act in this world with mixed results.\n\nSometimes we are successful, most of the time we are not. Most of the time the results come completely contrary to what we think we should be getting out of our actions. So this chapter teaches us how to act in this world so our actions can be very effective. So the karma becomes Karma Yoga. Therefore this chapter is very very popular. Some of the great commentators have said the Gita is all about Karma Yoga.\n\nIt teaches you how to act in this life one way or other. It is a very important chapter for all of us because all of us are trying to figure out how to work in this world because we will not be able to avoid working in this world. So the chapter opened with Arjuna's question just as we all have. We all ask this question and say, yeah, this is great. In the Gita class we talk about all this -- desirelessness and actionlessness -- and then go back to your workplace on Monday morning and try to tell that to your client. From our perspective it does not work.\n\nI actually just heard that Mina watches this course in the morning, so I get the benefit. When I'm passing around, I overhear stuff. Deepak bhai from Dada Bhagavan -- they have a question-answer format. So somebody asks, \"Deepak bhai, when I am trying to focus more on this Prateekraman and spirituality, I lose my motivation to make progress in my job. Should I focus more on this or focus more on my job?\" Deepak bhai said, \"So what's your name, sir?\" My name is Janakbhai.\n\nJanakbhai, let Janakbhai make the progress in the job, and you establish yourself in spirituality. In other words, you need to separate yourself from what's happening in this world with you. You become a sakshi-chaitanya, a witnessing consciousness. Basically, when you take the role of Janakbhai as an employee, you have to work as an employee very effectively. When Janakbhai is in spirituality, Janakbhai has to establish himself in spirituality. But this answer is confusing, and Janakbhai can say, \"Deepak bhai, tell me one thing -- you are not helping me here. Janakbhai is one, and you are telling me to be two different Janakbhais!\" This is not Janakbhai's newly minted question. This question Arjuna had 5,000 years ago. So he said, Jayasi Chit Karmanaste Mata Buddhi Janardina Tatkim Karmani Ghore Maam Niyo Jayasi Keshava. You just discussed in detail what is right and what is wrong, what is better and what is not so good, what is higher and what is lower. In last chapter he says Durena hi Avaram Karmaha Buddhi Yoga Dhananjaya. Krishna in last verse clearly says that Karma is inferior to Buddhi Yoga.\n\nIn the beginning he propagated, you should go and fight for all these good reasons. Then he came back and said, you achieve the Buddhi Yoga. Buddhi yoga knowledge about what is your true self. Arjuna said, that's what I was trying to do. I want to run away and meditate. If you consider that Buddhi is better than Karma, you say it very clearly.\n\nIn last chapter in verse 49, the Durenahiyavaram Karmaha Buddhi Yoga Dhananjaya. So therefore you said engage yourself in a Buddhi Yoga. You clearly told me that Tatkim Karmani Ghore mam. Then why are you asking me to fight this war? This is like a person interested in physics who wants to find out what light is all about. If I ask a Mahatma like Sid Carey, who is a physicist, \"Tell me, sir, what is light?\"\n\nAnd he said, light can be a particle or a wave. I said, what do you mean? Is it a particle or a wave? Please don't confuse me. He said, no, both are right. Except that you have to rise yourself to a level in your understanding to understand both viewpoints.\n\nHe said it depends on the observer. Observer can decide it's a particle or it's a wave. So Bhagavan said, karma is necessary, but Buddhi Yoga is also necessary. One is superior than other depending on where you are. Vya Mishrena Vakhena Buddhim Moha Yasi Evame. This mixed Mishrena you are going the two mixed messages.\n\nYou are speaking from both sides of your mouth. One side saying go fight the war, that's okay, kill those people. Other side says, establish yourself in Buddha knowledge. This is confusing my intellect. These statements have already confused my intellect. Tad Ekam Vadanishchtya.\n\nTherefore obviously I am your Srishya. I already told you I am your Shishya. You tell me what is good for me. So don't go into this great arguments about which one is better. Tell me one thing that will be the best for me which will be Shreyas which is good for me. As you are saying shres and prayers.\n\nSomething which is pleasant but may not be good for me -- but something you tell me, it may not be pleasant, but tell me this is good for you. And I already told you, I surrender to you. I will do whatever you tell me.\n\nAnd then comes the whole of Chapter 3, Karma Yoga. Bhagavan said, Sri Bhagavanu Vacha. Now Bhagavan is elaborating on what Karma is all about. Loke Asmin Dvividha Nistha Pura Prukta Maya Anaga -- don't get confused.\n\nThere is not only one path in this world. Loki Asmin -- in this world. Dvivida Nishta -- I have established two paths. Because you need to give people alternatives. You have to have choice. Pura Prokta Mayan -- right from the beginning, I established two paths.\n\nThis is the first time, as lots of commentators say, that Bhagavan comes out clearly and says, \"I'm not Vasudeva Krishna. I am the Supreme Lord.\" That right from the beginning of this world, I established two paths. So you always had two options available from the day one. The day I forgot myself as who I am.\n\nFrom the day I forgot that I am the Supreme Being and taken up this identity as me, this limited being, I had two paths available. My loka started with the very first thought that I am this limited being. And Bhagawan says there are always two paths available. It is like I'm going to New York. My goal is to reach New York, and just around the Delaware, there are two paths. One goes to the New Jersey Turnpike, another is 95 going through Philadelphia and all that.\n\nI get confused and say which way I'm going. Well, I have two paths available. I can go through the 95 and I still reach New York. And I can go through New Jersey Turnpike and I'll still reach New York. So Tupa is always available to me. Gnana Yogina Sankhyana for those who are established in contemplation, those who are contemplative type.\n\nFor them Gnana Yoga Yoga of Knowledge, Karma Yogi and a yoginand. Those who are action oriented. For them Karma is established. Two paths are available to us. Either you have to work through your way to your goal or realize how to get there quickly. If I realize the New Jersey Turnpike will be quicker and I'll take quicker path.\n\nIf not, I'll work my way through Route 95, going through the smaller towns and traffic, but both will lead me to the destination. There is also something similar in our Indian system of marriage. In the Indian system, I say, well, if you want to get married, you have two paths. I'm not sure what is there now. Either you can have a love marriage.\n\nYou fall in love, find somebody and then get married. Or arranged marriage -- find somebody, get married, and then fall in love. Both ultimately culminating into what? One starts out by knowing first who I want to marry. Knowledge occurs to me -- that one I like -- and then I get married. But then I work towards how to live together, what marriage is all about.\n\nAll that takes place after marriage. Meena said, I never knew your true swaroopa till I got married, even though we were dating for three years. On the other hand, you get married to somebody, you work through an arranged marriage. Then you have to fall in love with her. The ultimate goal is to identify. Right now, my identification is with this limited self.\n\nMy goal is to identify with the supreme self. So identification has to change. When identification occurs, it becomes love. When I start identifying, then only I can love somebody. I cannot love someone I never met. So I have to first know someone to fall in love with her.\n\nAs Swamiji says, you fall in love, you rise in devotion. So to love someone, you have to know the person. So to love the divine, you have to know the divine, that bhakti. Eventually you're trying to achieve the Bhakti Yoga. That's your goal, to have devotion for the Lord. But I cannot devote to somebody whom I do not know.\n\nI love God, but I don't know who. That is not possible. So I have two paths to achieve that devotion. When I get the knowledge that who I am, that I am not this limited self, contemplating on who I am not, and I get the knowledge who I am, then I'll identify with that self.",
      "reflection": "Arjuna's confusion in these opening verses mirrors our own daily struggle: we hear teachings about inner peace and detachment, yet Monday morning arrives and we must engage fully in the world. Like Arjuna, we often feel pulled between two paths - the contemplative life of wisdom and the active life of responsibility. Krishna's response reveals a profound truth: both paths lead to the same destination. The question is not which path to choose, but rather which path suits your nature at this stage of life.\n\nConsider your own life today. Are you someone who naturally gravitates toward reflection and study (Jnana Yoga), or do you find fulfillment through action and service (Karma Yoga)? Neither is superior - they are simply different routes to the same summit. The key insight is that you cannot escape action by merely refusing to act. Even sitting still involves the action of sitting. The real question is: how will you act?\n\nTake a moment to identify one area where you feel confused about what is right - perhaps a decision at work, a family obligation, or a personal choice. Instead of seeking one \"correct\" answer, ask yourself: What does my unique nature (swabhava) call me to do? What path - action or contemplation - feels more aligned with who I am right now?"

      "reflection": "These verses expose one of the most common spiritual traps: the pretense of renunciation. Krishna warns against the \"mithyachara\" - the hypocrite who outwardly restrains his senses while inwardly dwelling on sense objects. How often do we physically step away from temptation while our mind continues to feast on it? The person who refuses to eat cake but spends hours thinking about it has not truly renounced anything. The struggle has simply moved from the external to the internal realm.\n\nThe teaching here is liberating: you cannot achieve freedom from action (naishkarmya) by simply refusing to act. The qualities of nature - sattva, rajas, and tamas - will compel you to act whether you wish to or not. Even breathing, thinking, and sitting are actions. The path to liberation lies not in suppression but in transformation of how we act.\n\nToday, honestly examine one area where you may be practicing this spiritual hypocrisy. Perhaps you have given up a habit outwardly, but your mind still gravitates toward it. Or maybe you have withdrawn from a responsibility while telling yourself it is \"detachment.\" True renunciation is internal - it means engaging fully with life while remaining mentally free. Ask yourself: Where am I restraining my body while my mind runs wild? What would it look like to act fully in that area while cultivating genuine inner detachment?"

      "commentary": "So far we have seen the dilemma of whether to work in this world or renounce actions. We have discussed many times that action -- which is an interaction between I and this world -- creates impressions. These impressions on my mind create tendencies, these tendencies create desires, the desires create actions. And then the cycle starts all over again. The more I act, the more I interact with this world. That interaction will have this cause and effect relationship.\n\nThis cycle seems like never ending cycle that I can never get out of this. And the whole purpose of all this studies is to get out of this cycle. So obviously Arjuna is confused whether he should act by fighting this war or renounce all these actions and go to Himalaya. So that's where we started the chapter. In the last verse, we have seen Bhagavan say Niyatam Kuru Karmatvam -- a very firm prescription. You must do all your ordained duties.\n\nNiyatam Kuru Karmatvam Karma Jayahi Akarma Naha Because Karma is superior than inaction. Action is superior than inaction. So very simple, very clear that what you should do in life is do your ordained duties. And, and we have seen in last discussion, the ordained duties are. Daily duties which we can't really escape. Brushing your teeth, taking bath, going to work, all these Nitya Karma, there's nothing special about it.\n\nNobody is going to congratulate you every morning for brushing your teeth, unless you are a little three-year-old child. Then there is Naimittya Karma, which are the special duties -- when something is required by your family, your community, your society, your nation, then you have to perform those duties. You're not doing those duties every day. On special occasions you're required to participate. Either you have a voluntary army or a draft. If you're not volunteering on your own to protect your country, there will be a draft.\n\nYou have to draft you because that's required a special duty. So Bhagavan says Niyyatam Kuru Karma Tvam. Niyata Karma includes both the Nitya and Naimittya -- that means there is no escape from any duty. Swamiji gives the example that your friend is sick and he needs your help. At that time you can say, \"I am very busy.\" You can, but that means you are shirking your duty.\n\nYou are not doing your part. So Bhagawan very clearly says Nidham Kuru Karma Thomas Karma Jyay or Karmanaha Karma is anytime better than inaction. Action is anytime better than inaction. Sari Yatra Apicha Tena prasiddayat or Karmanah. By inaction you can't even sustain your body. We can understand that even to sustain my body, I have to act.\n\nAnd therefore action is prescribed here. So now we are still in the conundrum. On one hand we want to liberate ourselves from this bondage and other hand we have to act. So it looks like catch 22. So the next four verses, as Swamiji says, are laid out as the overall scheme of thing as the Creator has created how to act and how to be liberated from your actions, not bound by your actions. Also, when this world is created, there should be a plan for sustaining it.\n\nSo the whole plan is laid out in the next few verses. And I obviously had been listening to Swamiji from the Cold War era. Swamiji used to say, \"Don't blame me or don't put me in jail because it sounds like I'm a communist or a socialist. Krishna is the socialist, not me.\" Where Krishna now lays out the whole path of socialism in the next four verses, Swamiji says there is no real socialist nation on this planet, because even in communist countries, there are people who are just in it for their power.\n\nThat's not what the socialism is all about. So the next four verses lay out the whole plan of sustaining this universe and you being a part of that universe. How you can participate but not get bound by your actions. So the next verse says, Yajnar Thaat Karmano anyatra Loko Ayam Karma Bandanaha. Actions other than those performed for the Yajna are binding Loko yam in this loka in this world. This Loka is bound by Kun, cause and effect.\n\nEverything in this world is bound by cause and effect. There is nothing in this world that is free from cause and effect. Therefore, we give this standard example. If I see something in this room, it's an effect. If I see a table in this room, it's an effect. And I cannot say that this table has no cause.\n\nWhere did this table come? Kneel and say, we are chinma mission, we don't want to do anything. And table appears here. Obviously nobody will believe me because you know I bought it from somewhere. Even if I didn't buy it, I stole it from somebody. So buy, borrow or steal.\n\nOnly three ways we can acquire things. Table is in effect, so it must have a cause. This cause has two aspects, efficient cause and a material cause. Someone who knew how to make this table is the efficient cause carpenter and the material cause, the wood which was required. So having this relationship of cause and effect, this table comes into existence. So in this loca everything is bound by cause and effect.\n\nSo if you act, there will be an effect. So you will be bound by this cause and effect. If you are acting for your own desires, for your own betterment, for your own good only. But if you are working for the betterment of the whole society, for the cosmic order, then you are bound by one thing. So yajna karmano van Yatra, actions performed for the Yajna. Obviously we know culturally that it's a ritual of offering sacrifices in the fire.\n\nBut the original meaning, the significance of Yajna in the Vedic period, was to propitiate the deities who are in charge of these elemental forces. As an observant person, we realize that there are two aspects of my success. One is my own efforts, but then also the environment in which I'm putting my efforts. I may be a very hard-working farmer, but if there is no rain, obviously I will not have any success. So I know that something other than me is participating in my success. That's what we call Devam.\n\nThat's something destiny we call it. So these phenomenal forces are the ones I don't have control over. One year there is a lot of rain, the other year there is a drought and third year there is just appropriate rain. How do I control that? There must be some controller who decides this. That controller we call deva.\n\nMaybe there is a controller who controls this rain, a deva. So if we appease those devas, it will be good for the whole society and there will be rain for the whole society. This yajnas were the cooperative endeavor to appease the deities of phenomenal forces. So the purpose was to have a common good where everyone can benefit in the community. Therefore you hear the story about in Bhagavad, Krishna lifting the govardhan parvat. You know how it all started.\n\nKrishna was a reformer. Everybody was doing yajna to Indra. Krishna said, \"Why are you offering this Yajna to Indra? Indra is not doing anything for you. These cows are supporting you. This Mother Earth is supporting you.\"\n\nLet's have Yajna for the cows and lay Yajna for the earth. That's from Mother Earth. Mother Cow, they are supporting us, not Indra. So Indra got mad and then the whole story goes he sent all the storms and hurricanes and typhoons or whatever. And then Krishna protects them under the Govardhan Parvat. Even though he was holding it, everyone else was supporting it with their sticks.\n\nAnd then in the end what do we have? Because of the rain, there's so much food that when all the rains subsided, everybody said let's have a party. Everybody brought their own food. So there was Annakut. There was like the mountain of food. So if you think that potluck was started in America, Krishna started potluck from that Govardhan Parvat there.\n\nSo the whole idea is that we have a capacity to work together for the common good. When we work together for common good that include my good also. But not just my good, but everyone else's good as well. Those actions are considered Yajna actions. Bhagavan says all the actions performed in that spirit are not binding. You may be acting in your profession, but if you're only acting for the salary, then that's a selfish action.\n\nBut acting because you are improving other people's lives -- by participating as a doctor, as an engineer, you're making the society better and making everyone's life easier -- that's Yajna action. Actions performed in the spirit of Yajna are non-binding. All others are binding. So here is your escape hatch.\n\nYou can continue doing whatever you are doing. Just change the attitude that I'm not doing it for myself, I'm doing it for the greater good. Whether I'm an architect, a doctor, a housewife, a mother, everything I'm doing is not just for me but for the overall good of the society, the community, the cosmos, the universe. So Yajna Karmano Anyatna Loko Yam Karma Bandanah Tadartam Karma Kantaya Mukta Sangha Samacharah. Therefore here is the clear advice. Perform actions in the Yajna spirit for Yajna without any attachment.\n\nPerform your actions. Nothing you have to change in your life. Purely your attitude towards your actions. I'm doing these actions because it will help the Entire society. Therefore we have this now new awareness about green buildings, green society, energy savings. None of this is new -- we had it in our culture.\n\nTherefore when I go for my presentations on this green initiative, I say well, I never had to learn because it comes from my culture. We respected the mother earth, we respected nature because we understood those Vedic people understood the value of nature and our participation. Therefore Bhagavan says Tadartam Karma Kaunteya -- act for the Yajna. Therefore act for Yajna only, Mukta Sangha, without attachment. Not having the attachment that I am the doer. I am the only one who can do this.\n\nBecause you are just a part of the whole society. You are not an island by yourself. By yourself you are worthy of doing nothing. Just simple act of me coming to this class, I cannot do by myself. So many people have to do so many things. Police have to make sure that there are no crimes on the road.\n\nRoads are clear, the traffic is properly regulated. BMW has to make a car so I can drive a car. Gas companies have to put the gas in the gas stations. All that when it all come together, I can make the simple move from my house to within center if I recognize that. Bhagavan said you are Mukta Sangha. You are detached from your actions.\n\nSahayagnaha Prajaha Srishtva Purow Vacha Prajapati. How did all this start? Bhagavan says the Creator, when he created this universe, knew that he has to sustain it. If we create something and we do not know how to sustain it -- say we start a business -- we need to know how to sustain the business. If you start any endeavor or create any creation, you have to make sure you maintain it, you sustain it.\n\nSo you have to have a plan for that. You have painting artists create. You have to have a plan for how you are going to protect it, where you are going to display it, how to preserve it. So there is always a plan for sustaining something when you create it. Therefore, in Hindu trinity there is a creator, a sustainer and a destroyer.",
      "reflection": "Here Krishna introduces one of the Gita's most transformative concepts: Yajna, or sacrifice. The word transforms our understanding of action entirely. Actions performed for selfish gain bind us to the wheel of karma, creating an endless cycle of cause and effect. But actions performed as Yajna - as an offering to the greater good - do not bind. This is the escape hatch Krishna offers: you need not change what you do, only the spirit in which you do it.\n\nConsider the profound statement: \"Niyatam kuru karma tvam\" - do your prescribed duty. Even maintaining the body requires action. You cannot survive without eating, and eating requires the action of procuring food. The question is never whether to act, but how. When you work only for salary, you are bound by that transaction. When you work recognizing that your profession serves others - that the doctor heals, the teacher enlightens, the architect creates shelter - the same action becomes Yajna.\n\nToday, take your most mundane task - perhaps cooking a meal, answering emails, or commuting to work - and consciously reframe it as Yajna. Ask yourself: How does this action serve something larger than my personal gain? How can I offer this task as a sacrifice rather than perform it as a transaction? Notice how this shift in attitude, without changing the action itself, changes your experience of doing it. The action remains; the bondage dissolves."

      ],
      "commentary": "So we are now discussing Chapter 3, Karma Yoga, Yoga of Action. We typically evaluate before getting into any sphere of activity: What are my limitations? If I want to take a particular major in the university, am I good at mathematics, or am I good at science or arts?\n\nOnce I decide what my limitations are, then I say how I can develop my capabilities in that field. And then that becomes the field of my choice. So in Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavan in chapter two, give us our limitations. That Karmaniyeva adhikarahte ma faleshukajana. Our limitation is to act in the present only. And we have no control over the fruits.\n\nSo that's our limitation Bhagavan has given us. Therefore, Bhagavan said that do not worry about the fruits. They are not in your capabilities. You never get attached to inactivity. You focus on your actions. And then for development of my capabilities, then Bhagavan said, Yogastha Guru Karmani, establish yourself.\n\nYoga is nothing but the balance of mind, equanimity of mind. So once you know your limitations that I have no control over the fruits, but I do have control over my actions, then I have to now become more efficient in my action. And therefore Bhagavan said that Yoga Isthaha. Establish yourself in Yoga, you guys. Develop balance of your mind while acting. When your mind is imbalanced, there is no way you can act efficiently.\n\nSo once you establish the equanimity of your mind, then Yoga, Karma, Sukhaoshalam, that will be the result. You will become very efficient in your actions. You will be very dexterous in your actions if you can balance your mind. So your job is only to balance your mind no matter what the situation is. Because you will be acting in this world in myriads of situations. Situations are not in your control.\n\nThey will be controlled by the world of phenomena, the world outside the people of the world. You have no control over that. But you have to continuously act. Because you cannot stay without any activity. You cannot change the situation. But you can change the way you perceive and work in this activity.\n\nIn one of these TV serials, I heard a very interesting line: if you cannot change the Paristhiti, then change your Manasthiti. And I thought it's a very profound statement. If you cannot change the circumstances outside, you can at least change your mental reaction to them. Manasthiti, the state of your mind you can change because you cannot change the situation outside. The Bhagavan said Samatvam Yoga Ucha de balance of mind in all situations.\n\nNow that I have learned how to work efficiently, I need to know what is the field of my activity and what spirit I should be acting. So the last verse we discussed is Yajnarthaat Karmano Anyatra Loko Yam Karmabandana Tad Artam Karma Kauntiya. Bhagavan has now given us the field of activity: Yajna is the field of your activity. And we have defined Yajna as cooperative activity for the greater good -- dedicated action, sacrifice. So Yajna is basically people coming together in a spirit of sacrifice.\n\nEach one sacrifices something of his own for the betterment of the community. So Bhagavan said, that's the field and the spirit. If you act with all the capabilities you have developed by that samatvam, employed in Yajna -- Lokoyam Karma Bandanaham -- actions performed other than for Yajna are binding. We know that action is bound by its own reaction. By the law of physics, Newton taught us in high school at least that action and reaction are equal and opposite. Anytime there is an action, there will be a reaction.\n\nSo the action is bound by the law of Karma. My actions are bound by law of actions. So I'm bound by the result of my action. Once I perform action, I have no control over the result. And as the actor I will be affected by the result. So my action will have a reaction from the world.\n\nThat reaction is now the effect of the cause which was my action. Now the reaction from the world when I react to becomes another cause for the reaction by the world. So that chain starts the chain of cause and effect. Once I start the chain, I will be the only one who can break is I who can stop that chain by not reacting to the reaction of my action. So if I do not react to the fruit of my action, then I'll be able to break the chain of that action which I started. Therefore, Bhagavan said Yajna Anyatra Lokoyam Karma Bandana -- actions which I'm performing for gaining something, benefiting from my action, are all binding.\n\nAll actions are binding. But if I am performing action not for me but for the greater good then I'm not really expecting anything particularly for me and therefore there is no reaction from me and I'll stop that chain reaction. That's why Bhagavan said the karmas performed in Yajna are non binding to you as a person. Those karmas will be binding to the community for which you have performed that Yajna. Those karmas will be binding to the group of people benefit from those actions but not you personally. So Bhagawan says therefore Yajnaartaat Karma, Kauntiya, Mukta Sangha, Samacharah without attachment, now you attach yourself into it.\n\nThat I'm doing this so that the community will benefit. That will also benefit me. That attachment will again bind you. But if you are not attached to your actions in the first place and then to the results in the second place then you are completely free. So Mukta Sangha sam acharaha perform those actions. And then the next verse now says that this is the universal design.\n\nThis is not something Bhagavan said I came up with just to give you this advice. This is the original design, universal design, how this universe should function. The next verse says Saha Yagnaha, Prajaha, Srushtva, Pura uvacha. Prajapati said that I created Yajna and Prajaya at the same time. So Praja here is all beings. It is now narrowed down to human beings.\n\nBecause everything in this world other than human beings working in compliance with the laws of nature, everything is cooperating and complementing each other except when it comes to human beings. We have free will and we become the disruptors if we are not working in this spirit of Yajna. So Bhagawan said, when I created Praja, I also create a Yajna with it. There is a creative force in nature. That creative force is evolving things. And when it comes to a level of evolution that you can function on your own, Prajapati says, I have created Praja but I also created the spirit of Yajna with it.\n\nBy this you shall prosper. But I'm giving you means to support yourself, means to prosper yourself. This is your milch cow. This is your Kamadenu. And we obviously all know about the mythology of Kamadhenu the sacred cow which is capable of fulfilling all your desires. So in mythology the cow came out of churning of ocean and it is also described as a cow's body with human female head and bird's wings.\n\nSo it is basically combination of all beings. The this Kamadenu is all beings. The birds and animals and human beings all working together can fulfill any desire. In this case your Yajna is the Kamadenu. This cooperative spirit and the actions performed in Yajna are capable of giving you whatever you desire. When I created Praja, I created spirit of Yajna.\n\nWe know that everything in this world has to be working together. And every one of us have to contribute our own share for the betterment of the community. So if I am living in Hendrico county and enjoying all the services Hendrico county offers, I have to contribute my part as paying taxes. If every citizen decides that I'm not going to pay my taxes, there won't be any services after a while. So Bhagavan said, you do your part, but if you work in this cooperative manner, you shall prosper. You will get anything you desire by this Yajna.\n\nAnd the next verse says Devan Bhavayat vanena te Deva Bhavayantu vaha parasparam Bhavayantaha Sreiyah param avapshata -- Bhagawan explains how this cycle works. Cherish the Devas with this Yajna. You nurture Devas with your cooperative actions. Because your existence in this universe is not that of an island. You as an individual, as you consider is not really an individual. You're just part of the big whole.\n\nAnd in this universe everything is connected to everything. And therefore if each part is not working in a right manner, which we call it Dharma Chakra, if that's not working, then there cannot be any progress. There cannot be any evolution. Deva Bhavayatan -- we have discussed Deva before. Deva etymologically means \"that which is shining.\" So you know, in a vernacular language you have Diya, Deepak.\n\nSo Diva is that which is shining in human beings. Our senses are shining. Our senses illuminate the world outside. So these senses can only work if I nurture those senses. So for me, even the individual to function properly, I have to nurture my senses. Then the same senses will nurture me.\n\nDeva Bhavayantuvah, those Devas will then nurture you. You nurture Devas and Devas will nurture you in an individual level. If I take care of my senses, then my senses will nourish me. At the universal level, the phenomenal forces are considered devas. So in our mythological stories, The Devas are 33 Karod Devas or 33 Koti. The 33 great elements are the devas.\n\nSomewhere in his commentary, Swamiji has listed those Devas -- 8 Vasus, 12 Rudras, etc. In other words, everything in this world is important. Unless every element of this universe is taken care of, the universe cannot function as it's supposed to. Everything in the universe is working as per the laws of nature. The human beings have to be disciplined. And now, in today's situation, we all know about climate change, the green movement.\n\nWe know that world would have worked perfectly fine if we have not created the problem with the environment. Anytime I want to get something out of the environment, I have to make sure the environment is not affected. But which is where we are failing. I actually read a very interesting theory on Facebook or WhatsApp -- the theory was that the coronavirus had come out because of the 5G network. The presenter was so convincing, and he related all the coincidences, saying when electricity was invented, then we had this great flu, and all the pandemics were related to the development in electricity and how we use it. And the latest is this 5G.\n\nAnd the Wuhan was the main center of that 5G. Now there may not be any basis in this theory, but one thing is entirely possible, that if we do not use the natural resources with understanding, then it can create disasters which we have not anticipated. The global warming, we are all now experiencing the results of them. So here Bhagawan said, you take care of the nature and nature will take care of you. How can I as an individual take care of the nature? Bhagavan said, if you act in the spirit of Yajna, that every action that you perform, if you analyze and see that it is for the greater good and not just for me.\n\nAs Ezra Plate says, we will produce more than we consume, we will give more than we take. If I have that attitude of Yajna, the sacrifice, I'm sacrificing my actions for the greater good. Because you are cherishing Devas and those Devas, those phenomenal forces will then cherish you, will nurture you.",
      "reflection": "These verses reveal the cosmic design of mutual nourishment. When Prajapati created beings, he also created Yajna - the principle of cooperative sacrifice. The message is striking: this spirit of giving was not an afterthought but was embedded into creation itself. The Devas (cosmic forces or our own senses) and humans exist in a relationship of mutual support. We nourish the Devas through our offerings, and they nourish us in return. This is not mere ritual - it is the fundamental operating system of existence.\n\nThe verse's warning is equally powerful: \"He who enjoys what nature gives without returning is indeed a robber.\" In our modern context, this speaks directly to how we engage with our environment, our community, and our own bodies. When we take from the earth without replenishing, when we benefit from society without contributing, when we use our senses without caring for them, we become thieves in the cosmic order.\n\nReflect today on the balance of giving and receiving in your life. Consider your Devas - your senses, your environment, your community. What have you received from them today? What have you offered in return? Identify one relationship where you have been more of a taker than a giver - perhaps with nature, with a colleague, or even with your own body. How can you restore balance through conscious offering? Remember: the Yajna is your Kamadhenu, the wish-fulfilling cow. When you give in the spirit of sacrifice, all your legitimate desires can be fulfilled."

      "commentary": "So we are now discussing Chapter 3, Karma Yoga, Yoga of Action. We have seen so far that Bhagavan says: Sa Yagnaha Prajaha Srushtva Pura Uvacha Prajapati Anena Prasavishyadhvam Esha Vah Twishtakamadhu. In the beginning, when Prajapati created beings (Praja), he also created Yajna. So we are right now concerned about Praja. Praja means human beings.\n\nSo the Lord of Praja is Prajapati. The one who propagates progeny is Prajapati. So from that perspective all parents are Prajapati. So we are Prajapati for our Praja, for our children. So what we do for our children is not that we have given them life or created their existence, but we also have to create sustenance for them. So what we do is we give them education.\n\nThen say this education will be your milch cow. Use this education to get whatever you want. Prajapati is mentioned in Hiranya Gharba Sukta in Dhruva. So the Rig Veda says that previously there was nothing but Hiranyagarbha. So Hiranya Garbha is something like the condition before the Big Bang. All the potentiality but no reality.\n\nSo there is a singularity or the potentiality but no reality. So that Hiranya Garbha then out of its own potential, its own creative urgent, creates a mind. This is also mentioned in Brihadaranya Upanishad and Chandogya Upanishad. Brihadaranyak Upanishad describes this Hirinyagarba. Thus he says, first there was nothing but death and hunger. So death means nothingness.\n\nThere is nothing, there is nothing to devour, nothing to enjoy by senses, because there are no senses, there is nothing. And then he creates mind out of his creative force. And with that mind he creates water. And then water create a fire, then whatever in the water solidifies and becomes earth. So basically the creation is explained from the beginning -- from no creation to creation, and then a being is born in that creation. That being said, let this body of mine be fit for a sacrifice.\n\nSo that's the creation of your prajapati. In our modern day scriptures we say brahma is the prajapati. Brahma is the creator is the prajapati. But here prajapati is very defined as the pati of praja the beings. See in our puranas we also have Daksha Prajapati. He is lord of all beings. Shiva's father-in-law was also called Prajapati. So there are several uses of this word Prajapati, but here it means the primordial being from which all beings came. And then obviously that being was also concerned about how this praja will prosper. For any family man, his goal is to expand his family. So it actually says Anena Prasavishyadhvam -- may you propagate your progeny through this. May you multiply with this. We also can take it as may you grow with this.\n\nAnd then he said that this yajna which I have created is your milchka the sacrifice. That which I have created is the giver of all that you desire, all that you need. That's what Bhagavan started in saying. Sacrifice was created, Spirit of sacrifice was created at the same time the praja was created. The praja can only sustain itself by sacrifice. That basically was the intention of that verse.\n\nAnd it almost seems like the whole idea comes from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. The same idea is also in the Kathopanishad. So basically there is a being who is the first created being. This will be similar to the christian theory of Adam being the first man. It says that ishtakamadhu for you this will be your milchka, the sacrifice. The spirit of sacrifice will be all that you need.\n\nAnd then from that you can get anything that you want. The Upanishad also says Prajapati has two types of sons: one are the Devas and the other Asuras. Now, even if we don't get into our Puranic and Vedic theories of Devas and Asuras, at our micro level the Devas are our senses. If I take care of my senses, my senses will take care of me. If I take care of my eyes, I will take care of my world of seeing.\n\nIf I take care of my ears, my ears will take care of my world of sound. My world will be taken care of if I take care of my senses. So he said that you nourish the Devas and Devas will nourish you. At a global level or universal, we can say devas are the phenomenal forces, the nature. If I cherish nature, nature will cherish me. And probably it was difficult to understand this concept 100 years ago. But in today's time, with the global warming and all the concern about climate change, we can understand that if we as human beings don't take care of the climate, the environment, the environment will not be able to support us as a species on this planet.\n\nThe Bhagavan said that you nourish Devas and Devas will nourish you. With that cooperative relationship, thou shall prosper. Yagna sista asinah santah muchante sarvakilbishaihi. The good people, the righteous one, they eat the remnants of the Yajna. And by eating the remnants of the yajna they are freed from all sins. So as we have seen, the idea is not to just take whatever is left over from Yajna, but rather that the product, the profit which we make out of our cooperative endeavor -- if I share only the portion which comes rightfully to me, then I don't have a guilty feeling.\n\nIf I run a company, there's a profit. If I become so greedy that nobody else gets their share, everybody suffers. As we have seen earlier, if you get the lion's share of what comes out of the collective activity -- everybody has put their sacrifice in it, they put their efforts in it -- what came out of that activity should be shared.\n\nIf I take away lion's share, then I'm a thief. But if I take what is rightfully mine, what comes to me as prasad from that activity, there will not be any guilt feeling. What I take from this community, I give it back. I live in Hendricko County. I use their services, I pay my taxes. You have no guilt feeling.\n\nIf you're not paying your taxes, you will have guilt feeling. The good people who eat the remnants of Yajna, the rightful portion which comes to them as prasad of the Yajna, they are freed from all sin. They have no bondage of actions. As we have seen, the actions have this chain reaction of cause and effect. They will not be binding to those who work in the spirit of Yajna and only take what is rightfully theirs. At the end of that endeavor, bhunja tete twadam papa e Pachanti atma karana.\n\nThe same idea is now described from the other side. One who is only acting for himself, who wants his action to benefit him alone -- that one who is cooking for himself, Pachanti, one who digests only for himself. In other words, one who only works for himself and does not want anyone else to get the benefit of his actions -- he is Pachanti Atmakarana. Such a person is eating sins.\n\nIn other words, he will have guilty feeling. No matter how much you avoid letting other people know what you are doing, your mind will constantly tell you that what you are doing is very selfish -- that you are not taking care of anyone. If all people around me are suffering and I am enjoying just the comforts which are available to me, then I'm basically living in guilt. So those who are only acting for themselves and not thinking about the rest of the community, the universe of which they are a part -- they eat sin.\n\nBecause we are not islands by ourselves in this universe. I exist because the universe exists, and we are all connected with each other. Now, that idea is very clearly demonstrated by Bhagavan in the next two verses -- that there is no separate existence for anything in this world. Everything is connected with each other. Everything is dependent for its own existence on something else. It starts with us, the beings.\n\nThese are two very famous verses. He said Annad Bhavati Bhutani. This is the most obvious thing Bhagavan can state. That's something you and I can vouch for that my body is made up of nothing but food. So the beings are nothing but modification of food. Any being, any entity which is an animate entity you can think of is nothing but modification of food when it comes to the gross expression of that being.\n\nSo Annad Bhavati Bhutani the beings are created from food. The food supports the existence of being. Very obvious to all of us. No real argument here. Parjanyat Anna Sambhavah. And this food is only possible because of rains.\n\nSwamiji used to remind us that even people who are non-vegetarian, who are eating meat -- the meat also comes from nothing but food eaten by those animals, the vegetables or whatever grows out of the ground. So they used to say non-vegetarians are two-steps-removed vegetarians. Bhagavan said that food is only possible because the rain is coming down. And therefore we are afraid of drought. If there is a drought, there will be famine.\n\nThere won't be anything to eat. And then people will eventually die. All beings will die because there is no food. Food is the basic ingredient which makes people in existence. And rains are possible because of collective actions. Now, obviously this concept was difficult, as I said, for people probably who did not have this climate change.\n\nBut now we can understand the rains. The climate which is supporting this cycle, eco cycle is basically dependent on the overall actions of all beings on this planet and elsewhere. Probably also in our Vedic tradition, there is no rain. They will do some kind of Yajna to invoke the rain Gods. Swamiji even mentioned that even today people have experimented. But even if we keep that aside, our actions will keep this natural balance in the environment, so that the production of food becomes regular and our existence becomes possible.\n\nYajnaha Karma Samud Bhavaha. So the Yajna, the cooperative actions of all beings in harmony with nature, will create rains. But this cooperative action is possible because individual actions, Karma Samudbhavam that obviously we understand, unless each one of us do our part, there won't be a cooperative action. There won't be Yajna. There is no communal projects. So when you do communal project, the unit is an individual action.\n\nKarma Brahma Udbhavam. Now this is where I think it gets slightly complicated, as various translators have translated it very differently. At least this Bhagavad Gyasik, this Brahma is Brahma, the Creator. The Karma is possible because Brahma has created this universe. The other translation I have seen which says Veda Karma is possible because of Veda. In other words, Veda instructs you how to act in this world.\n\nSo we can go back to that ritualism. Veda says what Karma Kant to perform. And you are now performing Karma according to that Karma Kant. And therefore this Yajna is possible. That's one definition. Or you can also look at it as this universe which is considered as the Brahma's creation that makes the individual action possible.\n\nWithout that, there is no individual action. So it's a Karma Brahma Udbhavam with the know that Brahma Aksala Samudbhavam and that Veda or that Brahma is possible because of that imperishable Brahman, that imperishable self, then uncaused cause of all things, then imperishable Brahman is the root substratum for all that is happening. Tasmat Sarvagatam, Brahmanityam, Yagni, Pratishtama. Therefore that all pervading self is always present in any action, in any Yajna. Without that all pervading self, none of this was possible.",
      "reflection": "These verses present one of the most beautiful cycles in the Gita: beings arise from food, food arises from rain, rain arises from Yajna, and Yajna arises from action rooted in Brahman. This is not mere poetry - it is a profound ecological and spiritual truth. Nothing exists in isolation. The all-pervading Brahman is eternally present in every sacrificial action, meaning that divinity is not distant but intimately woven into the fabric of daily life.\n\nThe teaching about eating is particularly instructive. The sages who eat the remnants of Yajna (yajna-shishtashinah) are freed from all sins, while those who cook only for themselves consume sin. This transforms the simple act of eating into a spiritual practice. When we see our food as prasad - the blessed remnant of cosmic cooperation involving sun, rain, earth, farmers, and countless beings - we eat with gratitude rather than entitlement. When we eat only to satisfy our own cravings, we disconnect from this sacred cycle.\n\nBefore your next meal today, pause to trace the journey of your food. Consider the rain that nourished the crops, the earth that held the seeds, the people who grew, transported, and prepared it. Recognize the all-pervading Brahman present in this cycle. Then eat as one receiving prasad from a Yajna, taking only what you need and with full appreciation. Notice how this awareness transforms not just your eating but your sense of connection to the web of existence. Ask yourself: In what other areas of life am I taking without acknowledging the vast network of support that makes my existence possible?"

      "commentary": "So we are now discussing Chapter 3, Karma Yoga, Yoga of Action. We have seen so far that Bhagavan says: Sa Yagnaha Prajaha Srushtva Pura Uvacha Prajapati Anena Prasavishyadhvam Esha Vah Twishtakamadhu. In the beginning, when Prajapati created beings (Praja), he also created Yajna. So we are right now concerned about Praja. Praja means human beings.\n\nSo the Lord of Praja is Prajapati. The one who propagates progeny is Prajapati. So from that perspective all parents are Prajapati. So we are Prajapati for our Praja, for our children. So what we do for our children is not that we have given them life or created their existence, but we also have to create sustenance for them. So what we do is we give them education.\n\nThen say this education will be your milch cow. Use this education to get whatever you want. Prajapati is mentioned in Hiranya Gharba Sukta in Dhruva. So the Rig Veda says that previously there was nothing but Hiranyagarbha. So Hiranya Garbha is something like the condition before the Big Bang. All the potentiality but no reality.\n\nSo there is a singularity or the potentiality but no reality. So that Hiranya Garbha then out of its own potential, its own creative urgent, creates a mind. This is also mentioned in Brihadaranya Upanishad and Chandogya Upanishad. Brihadaranyak Upanishad describes this Hirinyagarba. Thus he says, first there was nothing but death and hunger. So death means nothingness.\n\nThere is nothing, there is nothing to devour, nothing to enjoy by senses, because there are no senses, there is nothing. And then he creates mind out of his creative force. And with that mind he creates water. And then water create a fire, then whatever in the water solidifies and becomes earth. So basically the creation is explained from the beginning, when there was no creation from the no creation to creation and then a being is born in that and that's it. That being said let this body of mine be fit for a sacrifice.\n\nSo that's the creation of your prajapati. In our modern day scriptures we say brahma is the prajapati. Brahma is the creator is the prajapati. But here prajapati is very defined as the pati of praja the beings. See in our puranas we also have daksha prajapati.

      "reflection": "These verses present a striking contrast between two ways of living. One who does not participate in the revolving wheel of Yajna, who lives only for sensory gratification (indriyarama), is said to live in vain (mogham jivati). The word \"mogham\" is powerful - it means wasteful, futile, purposeless. But the one who meditates on the Self, who is content within (atma-triptah) and satisfied by the Self alone (atmanyeva santushta), has nothing left to accomplish. For such a person, neither action nor inaction has any personal motive.\n\nThis teaching invites us to examine the purpose behind our daily activities. Are we running on the hamster wheel of sensory pleasures - seeking the next meal, the next entertainment, the next acquisition - or are we contributing to the cosmic wheel of mutual nourishment? The indriayarama (one who delights in the senses) may appear successful by worldly standards, but Krishna declares such a life to be \"aghayu\" - sinful or unwholesome.\n\nToday, observe your activities through this lens. At the end of the day, ask yourself: How many of my actions today contributed to the cosmic wheel of Yajna? How many were purely for sensory gratification? This is not about guilt but about awareness. Then contemplate: What would it feel like to need nothing, to be \"atma-tripta\" - satisfied within myself? Even if that state seems distant, can you identify one moment today when you felt complete without needing anything external? That glimpse is your guide. Cultivate it, and the desperate pursuit of sensory pleasure will naturally diminish."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter three, Karma Yoga and so far we have seen that act you must, because that is the nature of the Prakriti and you are part of the Prakriti. And Prakriti is maintained by each other's actions. And since you are part of that, you have a duty to perform your part in the Prakriti. How long do I have to continue performing these actions? Bhagavan said, as long as you are identified with the Prakriti. As long as I consider this body, mind and intellect to be me, I have to continue performing Niyata Karma, the karmas that are ordained by the roles which I take as part of this Prakriti.\n\nSo when I say this is me and now I take the role, I have duties to be performed. But when I get out of this identification with this Prakriti which is right now, this body, mind and intellect and identify with the self, then there is no action. Bhagawan says for such a person, one who is reveling in the self is satisfied with the self. For such a person there is no action because he does not have anything to gain which he not have gained already. Once I get out of this identification with the limited self and identify with this supreme self, there is nothing to be gained, nothing to be competing against, and nothing that I have to do to achieve what I'm trying to achieve right now, which is a complete bliss and a complete happiness. Because that the very nature of the self, the very nature of the self is Sat chit and Ananda.\n\nRight now I'm trying to get out of this mortality. I'm 66, and my life insurance goes till 80. It will be better if I die before 80, because all these premiums I have paid all this life will be in vain if I die one day after 80. So I can see my mortality. People ask me, when are you going to retire? I say I have no plan.\n\nBut then I say, I am already 66. In the next 5 years I will be 71 -- will I be able to function? So whether I like it or not, I am bound by mortality. And what I'm trying to do is overcome that mortality. I'm seeing myself as mortal. I'm trying to become Sat -- ever existing.\n\nI always find myself to be not knowledgeable enough. I don't know everything that I need to know. So I'm constantly in the quest for learning more and more and more -- that is Chit. The very nature of the self is all knowing. So there's nothing more to be known. And right now all I'm trying to get out of is the unhappy unconducive situation.\n\nSo I will be in Ananda once I realize that's my true nature. As long as you're identified with this Prakriti, you have to be bound by the laws of Prakriti -- that every constituent part has to function to make the Prakriti function. And therefore as long as you identified with the Prakrutti, you have to do your part. Once you identify with this self, none of the laws of Prakrutti are applicable to you. Prakrutti will sustain by itself. That's not your responsibility.\n\nBecause you say, \"Okay, I'm satisfied with the self and I don't act -- then who will?\" That's the one question everybody has. Who will do all these things which are happening in this world? He said, that's not your problem. Prakriti will take care of itself. You are in trouble right now.\n\nYou are in pain right now of this unhappiness. You want to get out of it. Once you get out of this identification, you have nothing else to do. There is no action for such a person. Say, till that time what am I supposed to do? Asaktaha Karya Samacha.\n\nTill that time, you continue working, performing all your Niyata Karma. Except right now you are performing with attachment -- \"People will recognize me, at least if I do something for my family, my family will say you're doing good\" -- I'm doing it out of attachment. He said, just do without attachment. Continue doing what you are doing. Except Asaktah Karma Samachara, you do all your action without attachment.\n\nWith that minor adjustment in what you are doing, you will achieve that perfection. Many people in the past, Janak Adayah Janak and others Karma Nai vahi samsiddhaha, they have achieved this just by performing their actions diligently without any attachment. And they achieve the perfection. So could you, so should you. And then he said, now if I have come to the conclusion that I have done everything, that I really don't have to achieve anything, then what should I do? Still continue to act in this world, at least for the Loka Sangraha, for the welfare of the society.\n\nOnce I come to the conclusion that I have achieved everything I have achieved, you continue to contribute your contribution to the society, for the welfare of the society. That's because the same poison which you have right now, of your own ego, once you take that and dilute it, right now this ego is identified with this limited self. I call me this body, mind and intellect. I take this ego and dilute it with a larger arena, it will lose its bite. At a 1985 camp, at the end of it, there was a question-answer session. Somebody asked Swamiji, Swamiji, do you have ego?\n\nWhat could be the answer? Swamiji, of course I have ego. He said, without ego, how can I control all of you? And now what we think is, if he has ego, I have ego. So what is the difference between you and I? Why am I wasting my one week and all these dollars to come here and spend time here?\n\nThen the second part of his answer is always is what comes out as the real answer. Yes, I have ego, and so should you. Because without ego, you cannot function. Without any identification, no activity can take place. However, when you take that ego and dilute it. So say you take a pinch of salt and put it in a cup of water and you taste the water, it will be salty.\n\nYou take the same water and put it in a jar of water. That salt will not be that noticeable. You take that same jar of water and put it into a whole pond of water. That salt is nowhere to be found. It is still there, so diluted in this body of water that that salt is not effective anymore. Same ego which is right now is so bothersome to me.\n\nWhen I take it and apply it to a larger group of people, it becomes manageable. When I identify with my family, it is much more manageable. When I identify with my community, it's even more manageable. I identify with my nation, I become a patriot, I become a hero. When I identify with the whole cosmos, Bhagavan said, you become the realized person. So he said, those who are satisfied with the self, by the self, they have no action other than those.\n\nAll of your actions -- for how long? As long as you identify with this Prakriti. And then he said, even after you realize that, you have to still continue to work for the Loka Sangraha, for the benefit of society. Now he's giving his own example as one who has realized what the reality of life is. Yadi aham na varteyam jatum karmani atandritah Mama vartmanuvartante manusyaha partha sarvasah. We also seen that Yatyat Acharati sreshta tattat eva itarojanah. It is the very nature of our being that we need something to follow. Some role model, some standard to follow. So someone becomes a role model in our life. Our parents, our teacher, our three year old granddaughter.\n\nShe comes to me and says, \"Dada, let's do numbers.\" So we'll put numbers on the floor. And I say, \"Okay, now I'll ask you.\" She says, \"No, no, I'll ask you -- show me number five.\" So obviously I'll say, \"But Medha, how about I ask you?\" \"No, no, no -- show me number five.\" So then I'll purposely show number six and say, \"That's number five.\"\n\n\"That's not number five!\" See, she mimics her teacher. She sees what happens in her class, and she wants to practice on Meena. She doesn't want to be a student here -- she wants to be the teacher. She actually does exactly what her teacher does.\n\nBecause we have a tendency to follow the behavior we find attractive. So Yatyat acharyati sreshta Purusha. So you have to set a standard of your behavior. Because people are going to follow you whether you like it or not. Because you are role model to somebody. And therefore he says, even when you reach the highest state where there is no action left for you, you have to continue working.\n\nBecause I as the supreme being, once we realize the self, he becomes the one with him. If I stop working, other people will follow my example. Other beings will follow my example and they will stop working also. Mama vartmanu vartanti manusyaha partha sarvasaram. We said that Rama took Avatara to set standards for us. What is the standard for good son?\n\nWhat is the standard for a good husband? What is the standard of a good king? What is the standard of a good father? He came to demonstrate what model behavior is. We may or may not agree with him on certain things. So Ramayana is Acharaniya.\n\nEverything Rama did is to be followed. Krishna, on the other hand, is not Acharaniya at all. What he did, you cannot do. Because he did the dance on Kaliya Nag, we cannot do that. And therefore you also cannot have 1,008 or whatever wives he had. So we have to set a role model.\n\nWhen we become the Supreme, we still have a role to play. If I don't do my role, other people will stop. Utsideyuh Ime Lokah Na Kuryam Karma Chet Aham -- if I stop working or acting, this world will perish. So now I think we come to the conclusion that Krishna is not talking about himself as Devaki's son. Because the world did not stop working after Krishna was gone.\n\nIt's still going on. He is speaking as the first person singular, as the Self which is all-pervading. The Creator and the controller of this universe. If that stops functioning, this world will perish. This world is functioning as a cosmos and not as chaos because it has laws. We all know there are laws of nature. No denying because we can test it right now.\n\nGo on a second floor and jump out of the window. The laws which Newton found out are still very valid after all these years. So there are laws in nature and then laws are enforced. So he remains the lawgiver and law enforcer, and he does not take a day off. If he takes a day off and the laws are mixed up that day, the world will be in chaos. Imagine the laws of thermodynamics working Monday through Friday but stopping on Saturday.\n\nSunday takes a weekend. I wouldn't be able to come here because the car won't start. So he said without taking any break, I have to continue working because this world will only function. The Prakriti will only follow the laws if I am there to support these laws. Sankrasi Chakarta Syam Upahanyami Imaha Prajaha. This teaching connects to our dharma and duty, which we sometimes find difficult because of our cultural burden and the complexity of the caste system inherited from hundreds of years.",
      "reflection": "Krishna offers here one of the most practical formulas for spiritual growth: \"Asakto hyacharan karma param apnoti purushah\" - by performing action without attachment, one attains the Supreme. He reinforces this with the powerful example of King Janaka, who achieved perfection (samsiddhi) through action alone while ruling a kingdom. Janaka did not retreat to a forest; he governed, made decisions, faced challenges - yet remained internally free. This is the gold standard of Karma Yoga.\n\nThe teaching on \"loka-sangraha\" (welfare of the world) adds another dimension. Even if we personally feel we have nothing to gain, we must continue acting for the benefit of others. Why? Because \"yad yad acharati shreshthah\" - whatever the great ones do, others follow. We are all role models to someone. Our children watch us, our colleagues observe us, even strangers notice how we conduct ourselves. The standards we set become the standards others adopt.\n\nReflect today on your role as a role model. Who looks up to you? It might be a child, a younger colleague, a student, or even a friend. How are your actions influencing their understanding of what is right, possible, or worthwhile? Now consider: if you were to act without attachment - fully engaged but internally free - what example would that set? Choose one action today that you know others observe. Perform it with the excellence of engagement but the freedom of non-attachment. Let your example be your teaching, for as Krishna says, \"the world follows the standard the great ones set.\""

      ],
      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter three, Karma Yoga and so far we have seen that act you must, because that is the nature of the Prakriti and you are part of the Prakriti. And Prakriti is maintained by each other's actions. And since you are part of that, you have a duty to perform your part in the Prakriti. How long do I have to continue performing these actions? Bhagavan said, as long as you are identified with the Prakriti. As long as I consider this body, mind and intellect to be me, I have to continue performing Niyata Karma, the karmas that are ordained by the roles which I take as part of this Prakriti.\n\nSo when I say this is me and now I take the role, I have duties to be performed. But when I get out of this identification with this Prakriti which is right now, this body, mind and intellect and identify with the self, then there is no action. Bhagawan says for such a person, one who is reveling in the self is satisfied with the self. For such a person there is no action because he does not have anything to gain which he not have gained already. Once I get out of this identification with the limited self and identify with this supreme self, there is nothing to be gained, nothing to be competing against, and nothing that I have to do to achieve what I'm trying to achieve right now, which is a complete bliss and a complete happiness. Because that the very nature of the self, the very nature of the self is Sat chit and Ananda.\n\nRight now I'm trying to get out of this mortality. I'm 66, and my life insurance goes till 80. It will be better if I die before 80, because all these premiums I have paid all this life will be in vain if I die one day after 80. So I can see my mortality. People ask me, when are you going to retire? I say I have no plan.\n\nBut then I say, I am already 66. In the next 5 years I will be 71 -- will I be able to function? So whether I like it or not, I am bound by mortality. And what I'm trying to do is overcome that mortality. I'm seeing myself as mortal. I'm trying to become Sat -- ever existing.\n\nI always find myself to be not knowledgeable enough. I don't know everything that I need to know. So I'm constantly in the quest for learning more and more and more -- that is Chit. The very nature of the self is all knowing. So there's nothing more to be known. And right now all I'm trying to get out of is the unhappy unconducive situation.\n\nSo I will be in Ananda once I realize that's my true nature. As long as you're identified with this Prakriti, you have to be bound by the laws of Prakriti -- that every constituent part has to function to make the Prakriti function. And therefore as long as you identified with the Prakrutti, you have to do your part. Once you identify with this self, none of the laws of Prakrutti are applicable to you. Prakrutti will sustain by itself. That's not your responsibility.\n\nBecause you say, \"Okay, I'm satisfied with the self and I don't act -- then who will?\" That's the one question everybody has. Who will do all these things which are happening in this world? He said, that's not your problem. Prakriti will take care of itself. You are in trouble right now.\n\nYou are in pain right now of this unhappiness. You want to get out of it. Once you get out of this identification, you have nothing else to do. There is no action for such a person. Say, till that time what am I supposed to do? Asaktaha Karya Samacha.\n\nTill that time, you continue working, performing all your Niyata Karma. Except right now you are performing with attachment -- \"People will recognize me, at least if I do something for my family, my family will say you're doing good\" -- I'm doing it out of attachment. He said, just do without attachment. Continue doing what you are doing. Except Asaktah Karma Samachara, you do all your action without attachment.\n\nWith that minor adjustment in what you are doing, you will achieve that perfection. Many people in the past, Janak Adayah Janak and others Karma Nai vahi samsiddhaha, they have achieved this just by performing their actions diligently without any attachment. And they achieve the perfection. So could you, so should you. And then he said, now if I have come to the conclusion that I have done everything, that I really don't have to achieve anything, then what should I do? Still continue to act in this world, at least for the Loka Sangraha, for the welfare of the society.\n\nOnce I come to the conclusion that I have achieved everything I have achieved, you continue to contribute your contribution to the society, for the welfare of the society. That's because the same poison which you have right now, of your own ego, once you take that and dilute it, right now this ego is identified with this limited self. I call me this body, mind and intellect. I take this ego and dilute it with a larger arena, it will lose its bite. At a 1985 camp, at the end of it, there was a question-answer session. Somebody asked Swamiji, Swamiji, do you have ego?\n\nWhat could be the answer? Swamiji, of course I have ego. He said, without ego, how can I control all of you? And now what we think is, if he has ego, I have ego. So what is the difference between you and I? Why am I wasting my one week and all these dollars to come here and spend time here?\n\nThen the second part of his answer is always is what comes out as the real answer. Yes, I have ego, and so should you. Because without ego, you cannot function. Without any identification, no activity can take place. However, when you take that ego and dilute it. So say you take a pinch of salt and put it in a cup of water and you taste the water, it will be salty.\n\nYou take the same water and put it in a jar of water. That salt will not be that noticeable. You take that same jar of water and put it into a whole pond of water. That salt is nowhere to be found. It is still there, so diluted in this body of water that that salt is not effective anymore. Same ego which is right now is so bothersome to me.\n\nWhen I take it and apply it to a larger group of people, it becomes manageable. When I identify with my family, it is much more manageable. When I identify with my community, it's even more manageable. I identify with my nation, I become a patriot, I become a hero. When I identify with the whole cosmos, Bhagavan said, you become the realized person. So he said, those who are satisfied with the self, by the self, they have no action other than those.\n\nAll of your actions, how long? As long as you identify with it. And then he said, even after you realize that, you have to still continue to work for the Loka Sangraha, for the benefit of society. Now he's giving his own example. So one who has realized what the reality of life is.\n\nYadi aham na varteyam jatum karmani atandritah Mama vartmanuvartante manusyaha partha sarvasah. We also seen that Yatyat Acharati sreshta tattat eva itarojanah. It is the very nature of our being that we need something to follow. Some role model, some standard to follow.

Sankrasi Chakarta Syam Upahanyami Imaha Prajaha. This teaching connects to our dharma and duty, which we sometimes find difficult because of our cultural burden and the complexity of the caste system inherited from hundreds of years.",
      "reflection": "In these verses, Krishna speaks in the first person as the Supreme Lord, offering His own example as the ultimate teaching. \"Na me parthasti kartavyam\" - there is nothing in the three worlds that I must do, nothing unattained that I need to attain. Yet \"varta eva cha karmani\" - I am ever engaged in action. If the Lord of the universe, who has nothing to gain, continues to work tirelessly, what excuse do we have for inaction?\n\nKrishna's reasoning is profound: if He were to stop working, the world would fall into chaos (sankarasya cha karta syam). The laws of nature - gravity, thermodynamics, the cycle of seasons - operate without a single day's rest because the cosmic intelligence behind them never takes a holiday. This is not labor as we know it; it is effortless, joyful engagement. The sun does not strain to shine; it simply expresses its nature.\n\nToday, contemplate what it would mean to work as Krishna works - with nothing to prove, nothing to gain, yet fully engaged for the welfare of all. Notice how much of your work stress comes from attachment to outcomes or the sense that you must accomplish something to be worthy. Now imagine working without that burden - acting from fullness rather than lack. Choose one task today and approach it as Krishna approaches His cosmic duties: with total engagement but zero anxiety about results. Ask yourself: If I had already attained everything I needed, would I still do this work? If yes, do it in that spirit. If no, examine why you are doing it at all."

If he takes a day off and the laws are mixed up that day, the world will be in chaos. Imagine the laws of thermodynamics working Monday through Friday but stopping on Saturday.\n\nSunday takes a weekend. I wouldn't be able to come here because the car won't start. So he said without taking any break, I have to continue working because this world will only function. The Prakriti will only follow the laws if I am there to support these laws. Sankrasi Chakarta Syam Upahanyami Imaha Prajaha. This teaching connects to our dharma and duty, which we sometimes find difficult because of our cultural burden and the complexity of the caste system inherited from hundreds of years.",
      "reflection": "These verses contain a crucial teaching for anyone who has gained spiritual understanding: do not disturb the minds of others who are still attached to their actions. The wise person (vidvan) should work alongside the ignorant (avidvan), performing the same actions but with a different inner attitude. This is not hypocrisy - it is compassion. Abruptly telling someone immersed in worldly pursuits that \"all action is bondage\" may paralyze rather than liberate them.\n\nThe revelation in verse 27 is equally important: \"Prakriteh kriyamanani gunaih karmani sarvashah\" - all actions are performed by the gunas of Prakriti (nature). It is only the ego-deluded person (ahankara-vimudhatma) who thinks \"I am the doer.\" This is a fundamental shift in perspective. You are not the doer; the qualities of nature - sattva, rajas, and tamas - are interacting with each other. Your body-mind is an instrument through which these forces operate.\n\nToday, practice observing your actions as the play of the gunas rather than the products of \"I.\" When you feel energetic and clear, recognize sattva at work. When you feel driven and restless, see rajas. When you feel dull and resistant, observe tamas. Instead of saying \"I am lazy\" or \"I am productive,\" try saying \"Tamas is predominant right now\" or \"Rajas is active.\" This subtle shift dissolves the grip of ego on action. Also, consider: Is there someone in your life who is earnestly engaged in their work, even if with attachment? Rather than correcting their philosophy, can you inspire them by your example of engaged yet detached action?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter three, Karma Yoga, Yoga of Actions. And so far we have learned that act we must because we are part of this Prakriti. The Prakriti functions because each individual constituent parts work with each other. Just as we have seen in a cycle of rain during the summer, the ocean water becomes clouds and then clouds become rain and the cycle continues. So there is a cycle in this Prakriti which is dependent on its constituent parts, the Prakriti. This manifest world works because each constituent part work with each other.\n\nWe being part of this Prakriti, we have our own duties and we need to fulfill their duties. So the advice is perform all your ordained duties, duties which come with the roles which I take in my life. I take a role of a father, role of a husband, role of an employer, an employee, a son. Whatever role I take, I should perform those actions. So once I understood that this is a part of my duty, I have to continue acting. But then I have come to realize that these actions create bondage.\n\nThe bondage of actions and reactions, the reward and punishment. So how do I get out of this? Bhagwan said, act without attachment. If you act with the sense of doership, you are responsible for your actions. And therefore either you will get the credit for it or a punishment for it. So act without attachment and you will not be bound by your actions.\n\nAnd then the next thing we have seen is that even though I consider that I have nothing more to do now I have achieved everything I need to achieve, it will still continue to act because other people are following your example. As human beings, we have tendency to follow others to act in our life. We need some role model, we need some guidance, we need some standards. And those standards are other people whom I consider to be my role models. I follow them and I become role model for others. And therefore, at any given time I should be acting in appropriate manner.\n\nSo others who are following me get the right role model standard to act for themselves. Once I considered that I'm not attached And I'm working. I'm working for the Loka Sangram, for the welfare of the society. Bhagawan said, even you can look at my own example. As the Creator, I have nothing to gain in these three worlds. But I continue to work as the law giver and law enforcer in this universe.\n\nThis universe is never without laws. There are no weakens in our natural laws. Law of physics doesn't stop functioning because now it's the leap year on 29th of February. I don't know what to do. There is no exception in nature because the Creator remained as the lawgiver and law enforcer in this universe. So we want to look at I as the Creator.\n\nEven though I have nothing to gain, I continue to work. Because if I do not work, this world will cease to exist. The cycle of creation, maintenance and destruction continues because the Creator continues to support it. That substratum which creates the substratum for this universe is always present in the universe to function. I, as the part of the Parakrati, should follow that lead and do the same. Continue to act even when I don't consider that I have anything to gain just for the welfare of the society.\n\nEven when you consider that other people are acting with attachment. Now I have come to the conclusion that the best way to act in this world is one. Do my duties as ordained by my roles I play, but act without attachment. So have no attachment to your actions and perform actions. But I know that the world is not made up of all those detached sannyasis. The people needs motivation for them to act.\n\nTheir motivation may be the goals they want to achieve in their life, their attachment to their actions, their passions. I, as the Gnani, have a responsibility to make sure that they don't get confused by this high philosophy. So the next verse says, Na Buddhi Bhedam Janayed Agnanam Karma Sanginam. It's a great responsibility on a person who has achieved knowledge that with my knowledge I don't confuse others. You know, in our Gita class, the one common thing we hear is, \"I'm more confused now than I was before I came to this class.\" The more you know, the more you realize how much you don't know.\n\nAnd that's a biggest responsibility in the part of the wise person. To guide the society in a right manner so that people don't take the wrong message from your advice. One person was an alcoholic, so his father or teacher wanted to give an example and said, \"Let me show you what alcohol does to you.\" He takes a glass of alcohol, puts a little worm in it, and the worm obviously after a while dies. \"Did you see what happened?\" \"Yes, yes, I understood what happened.\"\n\n\"If I drink alcohol, all the worms in my stomach will die!\" Another person was trying to find out where the brain of a cockroach is. He was a researcher, obviously. \"I'm going to find out where the brain of the cockroach is in his body.\" So he puts food in front of the cockroach; the cockroach runs towards the food. So he figures out the cockroach does have a brain.\n\nNow let me find out where the brain is. He breaks one leg -- the cockroach limps towards the food. It still has a brain; it was not in that leg. He breaks another leg -- it still limps towards the food. So the brain was not in that leg either. He breaks the last leg, and the cockroach can't move towards the food. He says, \"I figured out the brain was in the last leg which I broke.\"\n\nFrom your observations and conclusions and the advice that you hear, unless you're prepared for that, you may come to the wrong conclusion. So it's the great responsibility on the teacher and the wise people to guide the society appropriately without confusing them. Nabuddi Vedam Janayat Agnaram Karma Sanghi naam. The ignorant people who are working in this world with attachment -- you should not create confusion in their minds so they stop working. There was a time when some philosophies made people give up everything and become a sannyasi or a monk. Is that the real goal of life? Well, after all is figured out, society just cannot function like that.\n\nIf all the young people become sannyasis, who would support the Social Security for people like me who will be retiring? We need people to work so you should not unsettle them. Josayat Sarvakarmani Vidhvan Yuktaha Samacharan For a Vidhvan person, the one who is knowledgeable and is Yukta who is balanced. He knows how to motivate people. And if they are working with an attachment, encourage them to work. Joshayed Sarva -- somehow engage all of them in actions so that activity doesn't stop.\n\nBecause if they are acting, there is a chance that sometime they will understand what is the right way to act. Swamiji gives an example that if I am driving in a wrong direction, if I stop driving, I will never reach the right destination. But if I continue driving and then ask somebody and find a direction, then continue driving, I will reach my destination all the time. The operative word is \"driving.\" As long as I keep driving and then correct my direction, I'll find the destination. So it is up to us not to confuse our children.\n\nPeople who listen to us and say this is of no value. What are you going to gain in life? And that's not the way to guide the society. So for anybody who has the criticism that Hinduism teaches pessimism -- it teaches action consistently, all throughout your life. There is no discussion of retirement here. Bhagavan says, please make sure as a Vidvan person that all people are engaged in actions, because activity is the signature of nature.\n\nPrakrutehe kriyamanani gunaihi karmani sarvasah. Then where is this confusion coming between the one who is acting with an attachment, one who is acting without an attachment. Why the one acting without an attachment is more efficient. One with acting with an attachment is less efficient. The reason for me to act without attachment is not to detach myself from what's happening but to become more efficient in what I'm doing. The more I get attached, the more\n\nMy mental energy will be dissipated into the worries about what will come out of my actions. That I will be employing one third of my energy into what may come out of my actions. One-third of my energy goes into what happened last time when I did this, and only one-third of my energy is available for the present. \"The last proposal I did, I did not win it. Am I going to win this one?\" That will take away my complete focus on what needs to be done. Therefore detachment is necessary so that I focus on the present only and function fully in it. But where is this confusion coming for me where I get attached to my actions and it says this ignorance about how the world works. The actions in this world are working by their own nature. Prakrutehi kriyamanani gunehi karmani sarvasah. All actions performed in this universe are performed because of the gunas of the prakriti of the objects. But I on the other hand think I am the doer.\n\nAhankara removed atma out of my ignorance by my ego. Karta aham ithimanyate I think I am the doer. Even though guna gunesuvarthantaha -- the gunas interact with the gunas -- we are not islands by ourselves. We cannot function by ourselves. If everybody moves away from this town and I am the only one left, for a few days it will be very fun because I could walk into Starbucks, nobody can stop me, get a cup of coffee myself, go to the food aisle and get whatever grocery I want. After some time, there won't be anything to do for me, because there's nobody else doing anything for me.\n\nI am surviving because other people are doing their part. Therefore I'm functioning as I'm functioning. Once I come to that conclusion -- that things are working because these constituent parts of this Prakriti are working with each other -- then I will not develop the ego that I am the doer. I go to the lab, take hydrogen and oxygen, put them together, and they become water. Now I say, \"I created water.\" No, no, Neil -- hydrogen and oxygen acted on each other and they behaved as per their qualities to create water.\n\nYou are just a mere agent to put them together. So you are not the doer. You are just a Nimitta, Matra, Ahanka, ra, Vimu, dhatma, Karta, ahamiti many. He starts thinking that I am the doer. Whereas the actions are performed by the Prakruti by its own nature. Everything in this Prakriti has sattva, rajas and Tamas.\n\nThe basic ingredients in each thing. Those ingredients when they come in contact with each other they function according to their own nature. So two atoms come together. No atomic scientist to do engineered to do anything. Those atoms will act with each other according to their own gunas. Prakrutehe guna, Sammudaha, sajante guna, karma.\n\nSo one who is ignorant about this nature of Prakriti in the Gunas of Prakriti he gets attached to the actions. When I do something and then I get success. I'm now attached to my actions. Because I think I achieved this success. I forget that what I submitted as my project There are about 18 people in my office has to work on it.",
      "reflection": "Verse 30 is one of the most complete instructions on Karma Yoga in the entire Gita: \"Mayi sarvani karmani sannyasya adhyatma-chetasa, nirashir nirmamo bhutva yudhyasva vigata-jvarah.\" Surrender all actions to Me, with mind fixed on the Self, free from desire, free from the sense of \"mine,\" and fight without the fever of anxiety. Every element of this instruction is practical: offer actions to the Divine, keep awareness on your true nature, release craving for results, drop possessiveness, and act without mental agitation.\n\nThe phrase \"vigata-jvarah\" (without fever) is particularly evocative. Fever represents the restless, burning anxiety that accompanies attachment. When we are attached to outcomes, we experience the fever of anticipation, the fever of worry, the fever of disappointment. Krishna prescribes action without this fever - calm, steady engagement with whatever needs to be done.\n\nToday, before you begin your work, pause and consciously offer your actions to something greater - God, the universe, the welfare of all beings. Set your intention: \"These actions are not for my ego's gratification but are offered as service.\" Throughout the day, check in: Is there \"fever\" in my work? Am I anxious about outcomes? When you notice the fever rising, remember: \"Guna guneshu vartanta\" - the qualities of nature are simply interacting with the qualities of nature. You, the witness, are untouched. Then return to action with renewed calm. In the evening, reflect: How did working with this attitude change my experience of the day?"

      ],
      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter three, Karma Yoga, Yoga of Action. So we have seen in last few verses. Bhagavan says that Prakrute, he, kriyamanani, gunaihi, karmani, sarvasa, all actions are performed by Prakriti. Ahankara, vimu, dhatma, karta, aham ithimanyade. But the one who is deluded by ego, he thinks he is the doer. So this is something Bhagavan is trying to clarify, which we have learnt in chapter two, that Purusha is the enabler.\n\nPrakriti functions when Purusha and Prakriti come together. But all actions belong to Prakriti. There is no activity in I, the Purusha that we consider our own self, the I which last time we talked of will and free will. German philosopher Schopenhauer wrote a book called the World as Will and Representation. So this will is the force which enables the Prakriti to represent itself. So here we are saying the actions are performed in Prakrut.\n\nThere is something similar to the situation in my house, where there are several gadgets which generate heat, light, sound, and pictures, which make the house lively and livable. But all this equipment is only functioning when it's electrified. So if a bulb somehow gets this ego that \"I am the one who gives light,\" then the electricity as the guru can come and tell that bulb, \"No, no. All activities are performed by the equipment, but not because of themselves -- because of the electricity functioning through them.\" But activity does not belong to electricity. Whether the bulb is not functioning well, or is dim or bright --\n\nthat does not belong to the electricity; it belongs to the bulb itself. See, the bulb is getting jealous -- \"That other bulb is brighter, and I am dimmer, and I have to do something to be brighter.\" All that belongs to Prakriti. But once it's first of all know that you are not the doer. Your dimness or brightness belongs to the equipment and not to you, the electricity.\n\nAhankara Vimudhatma Karta Aham Iti Manyate -- he thinks that he is the doer. But one who knows the reality, the truth about the gunas and Karma -- Tattva-vit Tu Mahabhaho Guna Karma Vibhagayoh -- he knows the gunas of the Prakriti: Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas, and their functions. The function of Sattva is existence and knowledge.\n\nRajas is activity and Tamas is inertia. They have their own gunas, things which are made up of these three gunas in Prakriti. They function according to those gunas and permutation combinations of those gunas. Guna Gunesajjade Knowing that the qualities of my senses and the sense objects outside, when they come together, when the activity takes place, as we have seen last time, that the senses create sensation on the mind, the sensation creates the perception in mind. That perception conception of that object, that conception of that object. If it is in line with my tendencies, then it creates action.\n\nIf it is not in line with my tendency, I won't even pay attention. There are so many sensations come to me, but I am only aware of those I am paying attention to. And I am paying attention to those only which are in line with my tendencies. So Bhagavan says, Guna Guneshu Vartan Tah. My guna is this limited being and the guna of the objects outside, they are acting with each other, but I remains uninvolved. So the verse we have seen which is almost a summary of Karma Yoga in two lines.\n\nBhagavan says how to practice Karma Yoga. Mai sarvani Karmani Sanyasya Adhyatma Cheta Saha Nirasi Nirmamo Bhatva Yidyaswa Vigatha Juraha. Renouncing all actions in me with mind centered on yourself. It's like that electricity guru telling the bulb, \"You offer all your light to me. It is me who enables you to give light. You just focus on your own self.\"\n\nWhat is your reality? Nirasi Nirmamo Bhatva. You do not have any expectation what will come out of me. So don't consider your past achievement is yours. All that was happening for that bulb is because of electricity. As long as electricity is functioning, whether it was giving a good light or a bad light or it was performing according to the expectation of the home owner or not.\n\nAll that is because of the electricity. Whatever is coming out of you as actions, devote all of them to me, the enabler. So here the me, as Bhagavan said, is Your own self, your true self which is limitless. You are binding it into your own limitedness. You offer all your actions to me and do not have any expectations. Do not dwell in future.\n\nWhat will happen in future? Will my actions generate good results or not? Will I achieve something or not? All that you leave to the Karma Phaladata, the giver of fruits, and remain Nirmamaha. All you accomplished in the past is also past. We have a great tendency, most of the older cultures especially, to dwell in the past and say we used to have a great culture.\n\nLook at our culture in Mahabharata. Look at our culture in Rama's time. That doesn't really matter. What are you doing right now matters. Your culture right now. Are we the most cultured people on this planet?\n\nDo we have the right values or are we corrupt people? That matters what we are doing right now, not what we did in the past. Not we may do in the future. So Bhagawan said Nirasi Nirmama Bhutva Yudhyasva Vigata Jwaraha. You engage in your activity. Inactivity is not an option for you.\n\nYou engage in your activity without having these agitations in your mind which is like a fever will rob your energy. This agitations about what will I get in the future and what are my accomplishments in the past. Forget about all of that. Become completely healthy to function in present. That's basically a summary of Karma Yoga. Act in present, do not worry about the future.\n\nDo not regret what you did or did not do or accomplish in the past. And engage yourself in actions. Devote all actions to the enabler, the self in you. You can only act as long as you are living. You will not be able to act when you die. After your death, there is no activity for this limited body.\n\nSo therefore offer all your actions to the enabler, the consciousness, your own self. And then Bhagavan says, Yeme Matamin, this is my opinion whether you like it or not. But I'm telling you, this is my Eme Matamidam Nityam Anuthisthanti Manavah. Those people who follow these teachings of mine. This teaching which I have just taught you, the Karma Yoga, how to act in this world, Offer your actions to the Supreme Self, the supreme will. Our desire is to live.\n\nSo there is a will to live, a will to act. Free will is something when I have more choices and I can choose one of them, that's a free will. If I have a Desire to play outside as a child. But my mother said that you have to do homework. Well if I can decide it's a free will. But if my mother decides then no, no.\n\nYou can go out to play right now but do your homework. That's not a free will. So Bhagavan says that you have free will. You have a very narrow window of free will. Either you can choose my teachings of how to act in this world, or you can follow other opinions about how you can get happiness through your actions. So we do have a concept in the last time we argued about whether we have concept of free.\n\nWe do have a concept of free. We call it Purushartha Purushasthana Prarabdha. Prarabdhdha is something I have no control over. There is no free will there in Prarabdha. The situation I'm facing is because of my past actions. Those past actions go as long as I can think about my existence.\n\nThis life, previous life, life previous to that, whatever that is. That's Prarabdha situation is presented to me by my Prarabdha. The way I act in this situation is my Purushart. I don't have a complete free will that I can do whatever I want Because I can't change the situation. But I do have free will to act within the circumstances. See, will of an individual is always limited.\n\nA complete free will is the universal will. The will of God as we call it in our religious terminology. Universal will is free. I have a limited free will and I can exercise that free will. So Bhagawan said those who exercise their narrow free will to follow my teachings Eme matamidam nityam Anuthisthati Manava who constantly follow my teachings. Sraddhavantaha Anusuyantaha muchante tiyapi Karmabhi.\n\nThose who follow my teachings with Shraddha without raising trivial doubts it is my opinion that they will also achieve the liberation from Karma Naiskarma Siddhe. They will achieve the final goal. So here couple of things we can look at. What Bhagavan is saying is that you may have your own doubts whether this is really workable. This Karma Yoga we had been talking about. Act without any expectations.\n\nDon't have any regrets about what you achieved all the way. Unless I have a passion to achieve something. If I have a fire in my belly to go and get it how am I going to get it? Unless I have this passion to achieve and I'LL do anything to achieve it based on my tendencies. Bhagawan said, put all this thing aside. Don't raise those trivial doubts in your mind.\n\nIf you subside those trivial doubts in your mind and have Sraddha, have faith that this will work and then you follow all the time. Nityam, Anuti, Sthunti, Manava. Those people who practice, practice that narrow free will to take my advice and have faith in it and follow, they will also be released from all karma, all actions, all sorrows, all unhappiness. We may have heard before, before Gita came along, there were so many other maths as we have discussed there Sat Dashara, Samari, Swarvadi, Samarani, Swarvadi. Some say going to heaven is the only goal. And others say the liberation is the goal.\n\nThere are so many Mata. But I say Krishna says this is my Mata. You may think this is so simplistic. People say to achieve the Samadhi, Yogi has to practice for a long period of time. And you are saying Samatvam Yoga, Uchathe, just a balanced mind and you're done. So you may have lots of doubts.\n\nBut if your faith in my teachings and follow, you shall achieve that nice karma. So we have discussed many times this word Shraddha. Is it the blind faith that Krishna cannot be wrong, that I have to follow him whether I like it or not? We have come across several definitions of Shraddha. One Swamiji gives in Vivekachudamani.\n\nHe says, my belief in what I do not know, something I do not know. I do not know whether Bhagavan exists or not. That's my belief that yes, there is a superior power. Even though I do not know what that power is right now. But I have believed that I may come to know sometime. If I work at it diligently, I will come to know that power, that supreme power.\n\nWhat I believe in is Shraddha. If I have a belief in something which I do not have direct knowledge of right now, the faith that I will come to know -- then my belief is correct. Swamiji says that's Shraddha. That's Swamiji's definition. But Shankaracharya's definition is: Guru Vedanta Vakya Adishu Vishvasah Shraddha -- my trust in the words of my teacher and scriptures.\n\nScriptures in a sense, the books of knowledge which I have trusted. Upanishads, Vedanta, Bible, whatever you consider book of knowledge, if you have trust in that, that's Sraddha.",
      "reflection": "Krishna presents here a clear choice with clear consequences. Those who follow His teaching with shraddha (faith) and without anasuya (fault-finding) are freed from the bondage of karma. Those who reject it, carp at it, or fail to practice it are declared \"nashtan\" - lost or destroyed, deluded in all their knowledge. Strong words, but Krishna speaks them to emphasize that this is not mere philosophy to debate but a practical path to follow.\n\nThe teaching on shraddha deserves special attention. Shraddha is not blind faith but trusting confidence - the willingness to act on a teaching before you have fully verified it through experience. It is like trusting a doctor's prescription before the medicine has cured you. Without this initial trust, no experiment can begin. Equally important is being \"anasuyanto\" - free from the tendency to find fault, to argue, to resist. This does not mean uncritical acceptance, but rather an open, receptive attitude that allows the teaching to work.\n\nExamine your relationship with these teachings today. Do you approach them with shraddha - a genuine willingness to experiment and experience? Or do you find yourself arguing, doubting, finding reasons why they might not work for you? Notice that Krishna does not ask for blind belief but for sincere practice. He says \"anutishthanti\" - those who follow, practice, live by these teachings. Today, choose one principle from Karma Yoga - perhaps acting without attachment to results, or offering your work as Yajna - and practice it with full shraddha, suspending your inner critic for just one day. Let your experience, not your arguments, be the test."

But right now, the more I act, the more bound I am -- the more I seek happiness, the more I collect unhappiness. As we discussed last time, the Sukha is something which is defined by absence of dukkha.\n\nAs long as I have dukkha of any kind, sukha cannot be experienced. 99% of my body is very healthy except my heart. We typically argue when contractors or clients find mistakes in our drawings: \"But look at the rest of the project, how well we have done.\" But I tell them that doesn't count. An error is an error; that creates problems for us.\n\nIf a car you buy is 99% perfect except the engine is not firing properly, is that a good car or a lemon? So when I have some dukkha, I'm dukkhi. The more I try to achieve happiness, I somewhere along the line acquire unhappiness. If I look at my life, it is basically more unhappiness with a little happiness scattered here and there. The happiness is experienced when I don't have to gain anything.\n\nThe day I feel that I have everything I want and I don't have to acquire anything that day, I feel happy. The next moment I realize, \"Oh, but I forgot -- I have to also achieve this,\" and the unhappiness starts all over again, or the pursuit of happiness starts all over again. So Bhagavan said there is a technique to get out of this rut of trying to get happiness and getting unhappiness in the bargain. The first thing he said is: do it for the greater good. Don't think about yourself. Think about whether it's going to help others.\n\nAnd then act with the first technique. Secondly, he says, all your likes and dislikes are in your senses only. The likes and dislikes of the object reside in your senses only. If I close my eyes, there is neither a good sight nor a bad sight. That's why when we are afraid, we close our eyes. We don't want to see. We want to shut down that sense.\n\nSo say, know that they are at your sense level. You do not let that become yours. So you get detached from these likes and dislikes. Bhagawan also said that what can you do? You will always act according to your Prakriti Nigraha Kim karishadi. Even a wise man, he knows what is right, what is wrong.\n\nBut he cannot always act accordingly. Most doctors -- at least when I was in India and my friends were doctors, medical students, and recently graduated doctors -- they were all smoking heavily. Even a wise man who knows all that. But because the force of those vasanas will make you only behave in that manner. Till you exhaust those vasanas or till you transcend those vasanas.\n\nWhen we were children, we were hung up on little things. But as we grow up, those little attachments to toys drop away, because you transcended them. So as long as I'm under the sway of vasanas, I will act according to those vasanas. But once I don't let those vasanas overpower me -- You are going to act according to your vasanas.\n\nBut you can sublimate those as I gave you examples. Swami Dheerananda said, if you like to sing all those movie songs, convert them into Bhajans and then come and sing at the Chinmay Mission. So you can take your vasanas and give them a direction which is more conducive to your liberation that the technique is. Mayi Karmani Sarvani Sannyasya -- you offer all your actions to me. So all your vasanas, you offer it to him.\n\nJust like on a Shivratri. Devi said, when you offer a flower with each name, you say one of my vasanas Bhagwan, I give it to you. That's why in our culture, all this art, music, dances, is all Krishna in it. All those bandises which are done in all the different ragas, all about Krishna. Because they realized that to make this art a divine art, you associate Bhagavan with it.\n\nSame art, same bandishes. You are singing, and now Krishna is in it. So all these great Ustads, who are all Muslims, they all sang Krishna's glory. All our dances all about Krishna. Because these are our vasana. These are our natural tendency to express ourselves into art, music, dances.\n\nBut rather than making them more perverted into some very lusty field, they say, sublimate those same vasanas into higher fields. So Bhagawan said, don't let this Vasana overpower you. You find a way to exhaust your vasanas in a manner that gives you more and more joy towards the higher goal. Offer all your actions to me. If I go to work, I say, well, I'm going it for Krishna. When you have that attitude, then you will overcome all your vasanas.\n\nThen he says, adhatma cheta sa. And you try to find out who you are. You try to figure out who you are and then continue to act in the manner which is according to your vasanas. Because Sreyan Swadharmo we're gonna have Paradharmaat Swanushtita. Sreyan Swadharma Viguna. Whatever we are doing, we always think that had I been a doctor, I would have been making more money.\n\nI didn't realize when I was going to architecture school that architects don't make much money. Actually, our teachers told us in the very first class, very first class. Any architecture school you go. The first thing they said, if you are here to make money, there is a technology engineering college next door and medical school two blocks away. Architecture is not for making money. But we still thought that that may be the only thing I can do.\n\nI want to be an architect. Swadharma, that's what you liked. So Sreyan Swadharmo Vigunaha My dharma, no matter how it seems, devoid of qualities from the society's perspective, I enjoy it. But people says, you'll be a starving artist. Why do you want to be an artist? You'll be starving artist.\n\nI want to be an artist. But society says that's not really worth much. So Sreyan Swadharma Viguna Dharma as we have defined many, many times before in this class. The law of being, what makes me who I am is my dharma. Sugar is sugar because it has its own dharma of being sweet. If it looks like sugar, it feels like sugar.\n\nBut it does not taste like sugar. When I was in science college and I studied all my education till inter science in Gujarati. So in chemistry they will say Padarthana guna dharma nu varnankaram. Describe the characteristics of the substance. And that used to be a standard test in a chemistry. They give you a substance.\n\nFirst you have to do it in an observation, smell and then tell what it is. And then the next level is. Then you prove it by doing some experiment on it. I remember I was in interscience and there was some substance came to me. It has some very peculiar quality and I don't even remember what it was which is very rare. And I kind of latched onto that and I saw that I went to the examiner and said this is what it is.\n\nThat's because I latched on to one particular quality which was unique to that substance. Without that, that substance cannot be that. Dharma is that what makes that substance what it is. My swadharma is my own vasana. The texture of my mind, my personality. It is what makes me who I am.\n\nNow that may be viguna ha. It may not be much value to others. Anytime I read all these magazines and say what Bill Gates is doing to help the humanity, what Elon Musk is doing, what the Google guy Larry Page is doing. I'm not doing anything like that. I'm barely making any difference to my own family's life or my staff's life. But that's my swadharma.\n\nThis is my swadharma. Many, many years ago when I was still very, very novice in this Bhagavad Gita classes and lectures. One thing I realized, I'm at complete ease when I am in this environment. When I'm talking about Bhagavad Gita or learning Bhagavad Gita in the class everywhere else I'm slightly uncomfortable. So that's my swadharma. So Bhagavan says Sreyan swadharmo Viganaha.\n\nIt may not be of much value to others but your good is to act according to your dharma, your swadharma. What is your vasanas? What is your texture of your personality? Paradharmat swanusthitaat. Then others dharma which seems much nobler or well discharged is the translation. Well discharged means he is doing it so easily.\n\nI met few years ago in a convention for this hotel owners association where I go there because I design hotels. When I was growing up in Surat, on the street there was a Kariwala family. They basically had a grocery shop there. Their youngest child was like 4 or 5 years old when I was in college. So he recognized me and said, aren't you such and such? He said, you remember me?\n\nI was such and such from your street. Oh, you were a little kid. I don't remember you. And I said, what do you do? He said, well, I'm a hotel owner. So I said, well, remember I'm an architect.\n\nHe said, \"Neel, I don't really develop any hotels. I just buy hotels and sell.\" And he made millions doing that. He was a multimillionaire. He said, \"It's very easy, Neel. I just don't do anything.\"\n\n\"I just buy and then sell it.\" For him it is so easy; for me, that's a huge undertaking. You have to have what to buy and where to sell. So Paradharma Svanosthita is so well discharged by him his duties. But for me, that's not as easy.\n\nSwadharme Nidhanam Shreyaha -- by performing your duty, you may end up dying. In other words, you continue performing your duties, in the sense of what you like, and you die doing that. And may not accomplish anything from others perspective. But because it was your duty, it is better for you. Because that gave you the platform for exhausting your vasanas.\n\nThat gave you the platform for performing actions which give you joy. It may be more productive to go and do something else, but that's not your dharma. When I came to this country, I worked for a contractor for a while Because I did not have a job in architecture. And he saw some potential. He said, \"Neel, this is great. We need to be in business together.\"\n\nAnd after about three or four months, I left the job. I said, oh, I got a job at architecture office. It was not even a permanent job. And he was paying me literally minimum wages. He said, why are you doing this? You have great opportunity.\n\nBut that's what I like. I want to be an architect. I don't want to be a contractor. So that gives me joy even at the minimum wage. I felt like I'm doing my job. Paradharmo Bhayavah -- another's dharma, when you try to emulate it, is dangerous.\n\nWe architects deal with developers all the time. So after a while, we think, \"I can also be a developer.\" All these people come to me to ask advice.",
      "reflection": "These verses address one of life's most frustrating experiences: knowing what is right but being unable to do it. Arjuna's question in verse 36 resonates across millennia: \"What is it that drives a person to sin, even against their will, as if compelled by force?\" We all know this experience - the diet we break, the angry word we speak, the commitment we abandon. It feels as though some force within us overpowers our best intentions.\n\nBefore answering, Krishna identifies the real obstacles: raga and dvesha - attraction and aversion, likes and dislikes. These are not external enemies but internal tendencies embedded in our relationship with sense objects. They are \"paripanthinau\" - obstructers on the path. And then the powerful teaching on swadharma: \"Shreyaan swadharmo vigunah\" - better is one's own dharma, though imperfect, than the dharma of another well performed. Even death in one's own dharma is better, for another's dharma is fraught with fear.\n\nToday, map your raga-dveshas in one area of life. What do you find yourself irresistibly attracted to? What do you instinctively avoid or resist? These are your specific obstacles. Do not fight them directly - that only strengthens them. Instead, acknowledge them: \"This is raga operating. This is dvesha arising.\" Then return to your swadharma - your own natural path of action. Ask yourself: What is truly MY work, my calling, my nature? Am I pursuing it, or am I chasing someone else's dharma because it looks more glamorous or profitable? Remember: \"Paradharmo bhayavahah\" - another's path is dangerous. Find your own, and walk it imperfectly but authentically."

      "reflection": "Krishna's answer to Arjuna's question is direct and unsparing: \"Kama esha krodha esha\" - it is desire, it is anger. These two, born of rajas (the quality of passion and activity), are the great enemies. Desire is called \"mahashana\" (all-devouring) and \"mahapapma\" (greatly sinful). It cannot be satisfied - like fire, the more fuel you add, the more it blazes. This is the force that compels us to act against our own wisdom.\n\nThe three analogies in verse 38 are particularly instructive. Desire covers wisdom like smoke covers fire (easily dispersed), like dust covers a mirror (requires some effort to clean), and like the womb covers an embryo (requires time and natural development to reveal what is within). These represent sattvic, rajasic, and tamasic levels of covering. Some desires are light veils that a moment of clarity can disperse. Others are accumulated dust requiring sustained effort. The deepest ones are like the womb - they will only release through a natural process of maturation and cannot be forced.\n\nExamine your desires today using these three categories. Which desires in your life are like smoke - easily recognized and dispersed with a little awareness? Which are like dust on a mirror - requiring consistent effort and discipline to clear? Which are like the womb - so deeply embedded that only patient spiritual growth over time will transform them? Do not be discouraged by the deeper ones; even recognizing them is progress. For today, focus on one \"smoke-like\" desire - something you can see clearly is not serving you. Can you let even a small breeze of wisdom disperse it? Remember: you are not trying to destroy desire entirely, but to stop feeding the fire that makes it your master."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter three, Karma Yoga, Yoga of Action. All of us realize that we are defined by our actions. You meet a new person, the first thing you do is obviously judge the person by the way he looks and way he dresses and way he talks and way he acts. But the million dollar question we ask is what do you do? And whatever response comes, you will either enhance your judgment about that person or you will reduce the judgment which you have made by just outward appearance. You know, long time ago, when I first joined Chinmaya Mission in Houston, I met a person in a class called Rambhai.\n\nRambhai -- in Gujarat, it's a pretty simple name. So well, very old fellow, he looks also very modest, in conversation also. He actually came to me because he thought I was asking some smart questions in the class. So he obviously already had a better judgment of me. I'm making the judgment just based on what he looks like.\n\nAnd then I finally asked, \"Rambhai, what do you do?\" He said, \"I'm a structural engineer. I'm a research engineer, so I don't do normal building structures. I'm basically a researcher.\" The more I talked to him, I found out the guy has about three PhDs in structural engineering. He was actually awarded a PhD when he was in his undergraduate class.\n\nHe was doing his BE when he found a flaw in the way structural engineers for high-rise buildings -- like 15 or 80-story buildings -- calculate the structural load. He found the flaw in that theory while he was in his undergraduate class. As soon as I heard that, for me, Rambhai became a completely different person. I always remember that when I judge somebody, is he not another Rambhai? So actions we know are very important, but not all the time. We can act appropriately.\n\nEven knowing that my actions will describe me, will define me, we don't really do everything right in our life. So we have gone through the whole chapter about what right action is, how actions work, what is the right way to act. But in the end, the question came back, as Arjuna asked: even though sometimes I know what is right, I can't do what is right. Papam Charati Purushah -- we have cultural baggage when we say Papa.\n\nWe consider something sinful in a sense, something only the sinners do. As we have defined in our discussion in Vedanta, that which creates a negative impression on my mind is a Papa. That which binds me more and more to these limitations is a Papa. That which liberates me is Punya. That which puts a positive impression on my mind, which encourages me, inspires me is Punya. That which dejects me and depresses me is Papa.\n\nWhen I'm depressed and go through all that, I'm going through hell. So Papa leads me to hell. So what is it that puts me in this misery of life? Even though sometimes I know this isn't the right thing to do. And most of the time, at least in my life, I can tell you most of the time when I took wrong decisions or did wrong things, I already had the inkling in my heart that this may not be a right thing to do. But we did it anyway.\n\nBecause everybody says it's okay. My mind says, \"If you don't do it, you will be left out,\" whatever it is. But we did it anyway. So you say, Atha Kena Prayukto Ayam Papam Charati Purushah Anichchhann Api -- he doesn't want to do it, but Baladiva Niyojitah -- as if he is compelled by some force which is not allowing him to do what he thinks is right.\n\nKama Esha Krodha Esha Rajoguna Samudbhavaha -- not really a big revelation to us, but still, we never make the connection. When we do something wrong, we immediately transfer the blame to somebody else. \"I shouldn't have done it, but what can I do? Circumstances are like that. I wouldn't have been angry had he not pushed my buttons.\" We right away transfer the blame to others and kind of redeem ourselves: \"I'm actually a nice guy, and I normally don't do that.\"\n\nBut because of that, we have no chance to improve. What this basically says is: you have a chance to improve. Realize what the source of your mistakes is. There is Kama Esha Krodha Esha -- it is your own desire and anger which led you to do what you thought was not really right. Rajoguna Samudbhavaha -- these are born of Rajoguna, the quality of activity and passion. Going back to actions: they are very important.\n\nI need to how to act. Same activity, if it is not done properly will lead me to desire and anger. Then that will lead me to commit wrong actions. Therefore it is even more important how to do the right actions. So first thing we have seen is do for the greater good. Do without attachment.\n\nThat part is very important. That attachment creates karma and Krodha that attachment created the desire and anger. As you'll learn in the second chapter, the constant thinking of something creates attachment. That attachment then creates desire. Then that desire creates the anger. The same thought is transforming from constant thought to the desire to the anger.\n\nAnd then buddhi nasha. So Bhagavan said kama erudesa mahasana Mahapatma. Once you are overwhelmed by that flow of thoughts, you can't really get out of it and you continue to commit wrong thing. We have seen all the Hindi movies -- when he starts with stealing a loaf of bread and then he becomes a great Amitabh Bachchan-style angry young man. Once you are in that frame of mind and do not know how to get out, it will just take you further in that direction.\n\nSo what is it that I knew something is not right and this is right, but I cannot what is it that's clouding my right thinking? So the next verse says dumena abriate vahanihe. Just as the fire is covered by smoke, fire is there, but there is smoke. Where there is a smoke, there is fire. Smoke cannot be there without fire. But I can't see the fire because the smoke smoke is veiling that fire.\n\nYatha darshao malena cha. Just as mirror is covered by dirt, mirror is there. But I can't see the reflection. Anytime you take a shower, if your bathroom doesn't have good exhaust, the mirror will be covered with water vapor. You won't be able to see your reflection till you wipe it off. And just as the embryo is covered by the placenta, the womb --\n\nTatha Tena Idam Avrutam -- by that, this is covered. What is covered? Wisdom. By what? By Kama and Krodha. Three examples are given. As Swamiji says, in our scriptures unnecessary repetition is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, Bhagavan ved Vyas would give three examples. Just one simple idea. That knowledge is covered veiled by something. It gives that the veiling of various categories. Just as we have seen everything in three categories, veiling is also of three categories. Sattvik, rajastic and tamastic.\n\nThe first is Tume na vriya te bhanehe. Fire is covered by smoke, but it's very thin veil. A little breeze will remove that smoke and you will see the fire. It's like a sattvic veiling. My desire to do good for the society, my desire to do good for my family, I may get trouble for that, but there was sattvic desire. And then when I realize that society really doesn't need my help or I'm not capable of doing it, that desire will go away.\n\nThat's still availing. Sattva still binds you. By the happiness it gives you. The sattvic desires are still bonded, the golden chain, but still a chain. But it can be removed easily with little knowledge, little brushing up of what is right and wrong, it can go away. The next, just that dust covers the mirror.\n\nThis is a rajasic desire. I want to achieve this, I want to acquire this. Those don't go away with little breeze. You literally need some physical actions to remove the dust from the mirror. It requires a little more effort. You have to really have the resolve that I need to get out of this desire.\n\nThen only you can get out of it. Just by shining a little knowledge. Coming to Gita class Sunday morning doesn't take away Monday morning. I need to get that because it's a Yatha Darsho Malayana. So it's a rajastic desire which is veiling my knowledge of what, what to do and what not to do, what is right and what is wrong, what is truth and what is untruth, what is permanent and what is temporary. That wisdom which I have is veiled by this desire.\n\nYatha Ulbena Avrito Garbhaha -- as the womb covers the embryo. We know, and at least men can infer, how difficult it is for the embryo to mature and come out. It's not something which can be done lightly. It takes its own time and maturity. And then whatever the pain you have to go through to reveal what the truth is, which is the baby. So when my desires are tamasic for the sensual pleasures, then those do not, even with firm resolve, just goes away. It really requires a long term discipline which you have to mature yourself out of that.\n\nA child cannot get rid of their desire to play with toys. He has to mature out of that. So those are stronger, deeper desires which you just have to give time, letting nature take its own course. Just like animals evolving -- Swami Purushottamananda told me that on the lap of Mother Nature they don't do any karma, so they don't have any Papa or Punya. They don't have any baggage of this is right and this is wrong.\n\nMother Nature gradually takes care of them. So if you are in that category, let the time take its own course. Let the Bhagavan take care of it. Tena idam Avrutam that Kamayesha Krodhayasa is veiling this knowledge. Next was now defined what this and that is Avrutam Gnanam Etena Gnanino Nitya Vayrina Even a wise person's knowledge and for all practical purpose. Vedanta says we are all wise people.\n\nActually at the core of our being we know we are sat chit Ananda. But this wailing is stopping me to realize that. So Avrutam Gnanam this knowledge which is instinctively mine that who I am is veiled by Nitya Vereena. These constant enemies which are present in my mind Kamaru pena kaun the analayana cha this constant enemy present in my mind in the form of Kamarupa in the desire no matter how hard I try to get peace of my mind and we constantly sing my gimme vaidauri Santi Apnea Santi is what we are looking for all our life. But Santi we never got. Because this constant enemy is right there.\n\nHe's not leaving me alone. Other enemies you can leave, but this enemy is within you. It's not something you can fulfill one time and be done with. Desire is like that -- it's not that you fulfill it once and you're done. Duspurena -- insatiable.\n\nYou can put a little ghee in the fire and say, \"Now we are done with it\" -- but the more you put ghee, the more it flares up. So in other words, this is a losing battle for us. We already know that the more I feed my desire, the more it is going to flare up.",
      "reflection": "Krishna now reveals where the enemy resides: \"Indriyani mano buddhir asya adhishthanam\" - the senses, mind, and intellect are the seats of desire. Through these instruments, desire deludes the embodied soul by covering its wisdom. This is strategic information for the spiritual warrior. The enemy operates through our own equipment - our senses that perceive, our mind that desires, and our intellect that rationalizes.\n\nThe hierarchy presented in verse 42 is crucial: the senses are powerful, but the mind is superior to the senses; the intellect is superior to the mind; and superior to the intellect is \"He\" - the Self, the Atman. This tells us where to make our stand. If we fight desire at the level of the senses, we are fighting at the outermost fortress where desire is strongest. If we retreat to the mind, we have better ground. At the intellect, we have strategic advantage. But established in the Self, we are beyond desire's reach entirely.\n\nToday, practice this strategic retreat in real-time. When you notice desire arising, first observe: Where is it operating? Is it at the sense level (craving what you see, hear, taste)? At the mind level (emotional wanting)? At the intellect level (rationalizing why you should have it)? Then consciously move inward. From the senses, retreat to the mind: \"This is just a sensation.\" From the mind, retreat to the intellect: \"Is this truly good for me?\" From the intellect, retreat to the Self: \"I am the witness of all this - complete, lacking nothing.\" You may not fully establish in the Self, but even momentary contact with that deeper identity weakens desire's grip. Practice this hierarchy of withdrawal whenever desire arises today."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 3, Karma Yoga, Yoga of Action. In Chapter 2, Bhagavan had given us indication about who we are at the core of our being. That the self that I think I am is not the Self, but my self is imperishable, everlasting, all knowing and ever blissful. And it is contrary to my own experience. So it becomes a hypothesis for me. It's not my knowledge right now that the self is all pervading, everlasting, ever blissful.\n\nMy life is completely contrary to that. So Bhagawan says, that's because of your ignorance about yourself. So once I remove that ignorance, then I should be able to know the knowledge. That's basically our hypothesis right now. But my effort to know that is not very fruitful so far. So we have to accept that there is a limitation for me to know.\n\nEven all Western scholars and philosophers have come to the conclusion that there is a limit for the rational thinking to get knowledge. Immanuel Kant said, I have to limit my reasoning to make room for faith that there is God or there is a Creator of this universe. And you can postulate a theory, but it does not become my knowledge. You have to rely on faith. Our scriptures say you don't really have to rely on just faith, but you can experience that if you follow certain path, then you will be able to know this. In fact, our scripture says it is your birthright to know this knowledge.\n\nAnd you will know that when not guaranteed. So you have to make efforts. Efforts means activity, and activity as we know, has its own limitation. So in the beginning of this chapter, having been taught by Bhagavan Karmani, Eva di Karaste Mahphale Shukadachana, your right is only to act, never the fruits of actions. And therefore Yogastha kuru Karmani, establish yourself in yoga and then do your actions and you shall come to know this knowledge. But Arjuna obviously was not convinced that this activity is going to get me anywhere.\n\nSo obviously he asked that question. If you think then I have to establish Myself in yoga which is basically sit down, meditate and become a yogi. Then why are you asking me to engage in this war which is a terrible act? Why don't you tell me the act and can lead me to a greater understanding? So Bhagavan basically clarifies: Loke Asmin Dvividha Nishtha Pura Prokta Mayanagha -- in this world, two paths are created right from the beginning. Gnana Yogena Sankhyanam Karma Yogena Yoginam -- for people with Sankhya Buddhi, the contemplative intellect, the path is Gnana Yoga. This means contemplating on the fact that I am not this body, I am not this mind, I am not the intellect. \"Then who am I?\" is basically Gnana Yoga. And Karma Yogena Yoginam -- those who are active in this life, for them it is Karma Yoga. So basically, Bhagavan transformed Karma into Karma Yoga. And we have seen that Bhagavan has given five pointers.\n\nTwo we get in chapter two. You should not have the fruit in your mind as the goal for your action and establishing Yoga. Perform your all actions. Bhagwan says there are two parts. But for you Karma Yoga is good. Where you are in the station of your life, Karma Yoga will be much better.\n\nThere are three paths we typically talk about. Karma Yoga, Gnana Yoga and Bhakti Yoga. Karma and Gnana I have control over. At least I can make my efforts in them. Bhakti I can only get by God's grace. To fall in love is not something in my hand.\n\nWhen you fall in, there is no choice in love. Bhakti is love for divine and it is choiceless. It only comes by the grace of God. Therefore Bhagawan said, start with Karma Yoga. That Karma Yoga will lead you to knowledge about God. The Bhagavan said, activity is involuntary for all beings.\n\nNa Kaschit Kshanam Api Jatu Tishthaty Akarmakrit -- but you should act in this world by controlling your senses and without any attachment. So Bhagavan said, when Prajapati created this Praja, he also created Yajna at the same time. To sustain this Praja, Yajna was created. So we worry about our children: how would they sustain themselves when we are not there?\n\nSo we have to make them independent. How do you make them independent? By this education you shall earn your living. So focus on your education. That's how we do as parents. Prajapati did something similar -- Prajapati created Yajna, cooperative activity where you work with nature.\n\nThis cooperation between the beings in nature will yield results which will sustain this praja. So then we have seen a cycle in this Prakriti Annad Bhavati Bhutani, Prajanyatamna Sambhavah. And in the end says Karma Brahmod Bhav that the unit of this cycle is action. All that is happening in this Prakriti is happening because of activity in the Prakriti. And this activity is only possible at an individual level. At an individual level, if we act, then this activity becomes a communal activity, a national activity, a global activity.\n\nBut at an individual level you have to act. Then Bhagavan said, this ability to act comes from that Brahman, the supreme consciousness which is functioning through you. As long as I'm alive, I can act. So Bhagavan said, know that this activity is based in your consciousness and therefore you continue activity without any attachment. Because activity is to acquire something I don't have and preserve what I have. But if I come to a conclusion that I have acquired everything I want, should I continue to act?\n\nFor the Loka Sangra, for the preservation of the community, of the society, of this universe, you have to continue working. Look, I have nothing to gain, but I continue to work. If I don't act or work, then there will be a chaos in this cosmos. To avoid this chaos, the Sankarasyacha Kartashyam I will become the cause for this chaos in this world and therefore I continue to work. And then he comes to his final advice in verse 30 where he says, Mai Sarvani Karmani Sanyasya Adhyatma Chet Nirasi Nirmama Bhutva yudhiya, you offer all your actions to me. In this one verse, Bhagavan has given us a complete method of Karma Yoga.\n\nAct you must but act in a manner of Karma Yoga. Now what is Karma Yoga? He said, when you act with that attitude that I'm offering all my actions to the Supreme Lord. Because we have seen in that natural cycle that acts, activity at my level is only possible because I am a conscious being. That life in me, that consciousness in me is not different than the consciousness which is all pervading. Therefore I should offer all my activities to that supreme consciousness.\n\nNirasi Nirmama Bhutva -- without any desire for a particular result from my actions. And Nirmama means not thinking anything is mine; even this ability to act is not my own. This ability to act is God's gift to me. I did not do much to prepare that this type of body. I will have this type of mind, I will have this intellect developer. Well, this was given to me as my instrument and I'm now just using them.\n\nIf I have better equipment than some other person, it's not something that I have done in this life, at least. So Bhagavan said, Nirashi Nirmamo Bhutva -- you become desireless and without any sense of \"mine.\" Therefore, you should act according to your own dharma. Wherever you are, whatever station you are at in your life, you should act according to that, because you don't really have any choice but to act according to that. I can't suddenly wake up one morning and say, \"I really don't want to act as an architect anymore.\"\n\nYou know, this business is not doing well for me. I'm going to become something else. Well, I don't really have an ability to change right away. So Bhagavan said, Swadharma Nidhanam, Sreyaha Paradharmo Bhya Vah, you act according to your own dharma, according to your own Prakriti. Because to act like someone else is very dangerous. It may seem easy right now, it may seem glamorous right now, but because it is not your nature, you will fail eventually and you will not make any progress.\n\nSo therefore, he said, even a wise person is also bound by his own Prakriti. When a wise person is not free from his own nature, he also acts according to his own nature. Except that he does not consider that as his own nature. He considers this the nature of my body, mind and intellect. I offer all that I do to the Lord who is making me do that. You are bound by the Prakriti because you are part of Prakriti.\n\nYour Prakriti is basically who you are at this point and therefore know your nature and act accordingly. In Arjuna's case, he said, you are a Kshatriya. You are a prince who is responsible to protect others. And now you are in front of this enemy army. Your job is to fight this war. In whatever station of life I am in, I should act accordingly.\n\nPrakriti works by likes and dislikes. I have created likes and dislikes by my experiences in the world of objects. Some experiences I like, some I dislike. These likes and dislikes reside in my senses, in my sense perception. Some sense perceptions were pleasurable,\n\nsome were painful. They are your obstructions, and therefore avoid them. If that is the case, just tell me: what is the force which makes people commit sins against their own will? Knowing this is not right, I commit that act and then I come to suffer for it. So Bhagavan said, Kama Esha Krodha Esha. In the end, it came down to this: my likes and dislikes are the root cause of how I act.\n\nIf I overcome my likes and dislikes then it will be much easier for me to act in a rational manner. Why I have not been able to do that is because of the Kama and Krodha. This likes and dislikes create desire. That desire creates anger. This Kama is the root cause of all my problems. So Bhagavan said, therefore consider them to be your enemies.\n\nThis desire and anger are veiling my true nature. We started a journey from I do not know my true self and therefore all my problems in life. If I know my true self, I'll be almighty, all pervading, omniscient, omnipresent. That knowledge has been veiled by this Kama and Krodha. Therefore Bhagavan said Avrutam Gnana Methina. Now this Gnana is the Gnana of myself.\n\nAvruttam Gnanameti na Gnanino Nitya Vairina bhai. This knowledge is veiled from even a wise person. Kama Rupena kaunteya duspuraynanalynacha Kama desire. It is insatiable like a fire. And therefore Bhagavan says, Indriyani Mano Buddhih Asya Adhishthanam Uchyate. To fight the enemy, you have to find his location.\n\nThe location of my enemy is Indriyani Manah Buddhi Senses, mind and intellect are this desire's residences. I identified where this desire resides. It deludes the embodied by veiling his wisdom. A simple fact Bhagavan said is this desire is veiling your wisdom about your own self. And therefore this desire is your enemy. The desire is residing in your senses first by the sense perception.\n\nThis perception creates the conception of that object and then I have desire to acquire that object. If I can't acquire the object of my desire then I'm angry. This desire and anger is veiling your true self. And therefore, Tasmat Tvam Indriyany Adau Niyamya Bharatarshabha. Don't let this enemy come into your house. Once it enters your house, you are in trouble.\n\nTherefore you have to lock your doors, have a security system.",
      "reflection": "The final verse of Chapter 3 is Krishna's battle cry: \"Jahi shatrum mahaabaaho kaamarupam durasadam\" - O mighty-armed one, slay this enemy in the form of desire, difficult though it is to conquer! The path is clear: knowing that the Self is beyond the intellect (\"evam buddheh param buddhva\"), steady yourself in that Self (\"samstabhya atmanam atmana\"), and destroy desire. This is not suppression but transcendence - rising to a level of identity where desire cannot touch you.\n\nThe word \"durasadam\" (difficult to overcome) is important. Krishna does not promise an easy victory. Desire is indeed a formidable enemy - it has been with us since beginningless time, it operates through our own instruments, it is insatiable and ever-renewing. But \"mahaabaaho\" - mighty-armed one - you have the strength for this battle. The strength comes not from willpower but from knowledge and proper positioning. Established in the Self, you are invincible.\n\nAs Chapter 3 concludes, take time to integrate its teachings. The chapter began with Arjuna's confusion about action versus knowledge, and ends with a call to action - \"jahi\" (slay!). The entire arc of Karma Yoga is here: you must act, but act as Yajna; work in the world, but remain established in the Self; engage with the gunas, but know you are beyond them; face your desires, but slay them from the vantage point of your true identity. Today, choose one desire that has been troubling you. Rather than fighting it directly, ask: From where am I fighting? Can I establish myself, even momentarily, in that which is beyond the intellect - my witnessing awareness - and from there see desire as something that arises and passes, unable to touch who I really am? This shift from battleground to observation deck is the essence of victory."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter four, Gnana Karma Sannyasa Yoga -- Yoga of Renouncing Karma in Knowledge. We have completed discussion on chapter three, Karma Yoga. In Karma Yoga we have seen how to act in this world so that we are not bound by our actions. But our goal actually in life is to become actionless, to retire from my activity. So if somebody says, \"Why, Neil, you are working so hard?\" -- well, I am working hard to become actionless in my retirement. And how do I want to achieve that? If I can become financially independent so that I don't depend on the outside income. As long as I'm dependent on outside income, I have to keep working.\n\nI need to generate income from outside sources, so I'm continuing to work. The harder I work, obviously the more conflicts I create and more situation which makes me unhappy. More I think I'm controlling the situation. The situation controls me. So what I want to do is to create a situation where I don't have to work with the outside world for my well being.\n\nThat's what we call retirement. So that's why we have this 401k and IRA and all of that. That will make me independent. Once I'm financially independent and I don't depend on my outside income, then I can do what I want. Every year I took a cruise, and I realized that most of the population of the cruise is above 55 -- 80% of the people were senior citizens.\n\nSo all the programs were geared towards senior citizens. So I was actually pitying all the young people who were there like in minority. I want to do what I want to do. So the goal is always to be actionless, that I don't want to interact with this world. In the last chapter we learned exactly the same thing. For all these activities it says Yahatu Atmaratiyeva: everyone has a duty to act in this world according to their own dharma, according to the roles they are playing. It comes with all the Niyata Karma, all these ordained duties.\n\nSo you have to continue doing your duties. But there is Only one exception. One who is atmaratihi who is reveling in himself. He's not dependent on anything or anybody outside to be happy. Atmatruptastamaanava who is self content. If I'm reveling in myself, I'm self content.\n\nAtmani evacha santushtaha tasya kariyam na vidyaday -- the only time you have no duty to act, to do any work or any action, is when you meet this condition. Atmaratehe -- full of yourself. Not a right way to put it, but you get the idea. So you have no real need to depend on the outside world. Once you are not depending on the outside world, there is no question of having a conflict with it. It's only when we are dependent on them that we have conflict.\n\nI am dependent on my employees. My employees are dependent on me. We constantly have conflict. \"You are not coming on time. You didn't do what I thought you were going to be doing.\"\n\nHe feels the same way: \"Neil, you are not doing what I thought you were going to do for me.\" Because we are dependent on each other. If I am not dependent on them, there is no conflict. We have a project at Dominion and it's really going nowhere because we are updating the auditorium. The CEO of the company will be at the first meeting there on the 23rd.\n\nAnd the project is supposed to be complete end of March. It is not completed now. We don't know whether it's going to complete on the 23rd. So they're working overtime hours because the CEO is going to be there, they call me up, they call everybody. Obviously we blame everybody else who contracted into this. \"Why did you specify this, Neil?\" They say, \"Something which comes from Japan,\" all this good stuff. So I asked the guys, \"Did you always have this problem?\" The guy who's in charge at Dominion said, \"The only time I don't have a problem is when I don't depend on anybody. When I do work myself, that's fine. But otherwise, I have to depend on the contractor. I have to depend on you.\"\n\nWe all know for sure: when I don't have to depend on other people, then I'm free. He has no employees to worry about. His structural engineer was a one man firm and did very well, because he's not dependent on his employees. He knows what he can do, what he cannot do, and he can promise accordingly.\n\nIn my case, I have to depend on 15 other people when I promise what they're going to do. So in our life we have figured out that the only way to be free is not to be dependent on anybody. At the same token, my happiness right now is mortgaged to this world outside. They determine whether I can be happy or not. So Bhagawan said that the goal of life is to become actionless. I'll become actionless when I'm not dependent on others for my happiness.\n\nSo we learn that Yahatu Atmaratihiva, one who is reveling in himself, atmatrupta satisfied by his own self, atmaniyevacha Santustah is content by himself. Then he does not have to do anything. But the same token, I have to continue to work in this world. So I need to understand what is the way I can stop acting. And this chapter, the title says Gnana Karma Sannyasa. When the knowledge occurs -- what is happiness? What is it that I'm seeking? -- then all actions I can renounce. So now we are further taking our discussion on actions to next level. We understood that I need to act in a manner that I'm not attached to the actions. And also I should be acting in a way that it is good for everyone, that is for the greater good. Then I will not be bound by my actions.\n\nBut how do I reach to that point? I need to have the knowledge. My actions without knowledge obviously are not producing the result which I need to produce. So the next level of discussion in the actions is now how do you achieve that state where I have the knowledge? So the chapter titled Gnana Karma Sannyasa Yoga Bhagawan doesn't even wait for Arjuna to ask any question. He comes out and gives him his version of what we're going to do next.\n\nSri Bhagavanu Vacha Imam Vivasvate Yogam proktavan Aham Avyam Vivasvaan Manavai Praha Manohu Isvakave Abravit said, I'm now going to teach you the yoga which is imperishable. That knowledge has never become outdated. We used to learn something probably in last century about driving a horse buggy. In this century we are learning how to drive car. It will become invalid pretty soon if these guys are all successful. We used to put a lot of emphasis on handwriting, at least architecture.\n\nOur whole life in the architecture school was how nicely I can write. It's called architectural script. We spent all our life to perfect our handwriting. Nobody writes anymore. You can't differentiate my drawing from anybody else. We used to take great pride in that.\n\nEven if there is work left and there is not enough time, and somebody says, \"Can I help you, Neel?\" -- I want to make sure that nobody else's handwriting is on my drawing. Because once somebody says, \"Oh, that's Neil's drawing,\" I don't want somebody else's handwriting on it. But now all drawings look the same, no matter where they come from, because it's all computer.\n\nSo the skills which we were learning, which was so dear to us is no more valid. But one said this yoga is not like that, it's universal. It was always valid in the past, it's valid now and it will be valid forever. Ivam Vivasvate Yogam Proktava vyam I taught this yoga to Vivaswan and then Vivaswan Manavai Prah Vivaswan then taught in turn to the Manu. The Manu in dint taught to Manu Isva kavet. He is now making sure that you understand that this is not something I just made up suddenly.\n\nThis is an imperishable yoga. This knowledge is imperishable. It's applicable at any given age. So it starts with that. This knowledge is so ancient. It starts with the beginning of this creation.\n\nIn our world, the creation started with Sun. We at least know from our high school science that this earth came out of Sun. And then obviously all the development in the earth is because of that solar energy. So our source at our level is Sun. We don't have to go any further than that. So he said, even when the sun was created, this knowledge was there.\n\nSo Vivaswani -- for the first time, as Swamiji says, Krishna comes out as \"I am the Lord.\" In this conversation, the Creator, the knowledge giver, is saying this knowledge was always available from the beginning of this creation. So I gave it to the first created entity, the Sun. That Sun gave it to his son, which is Manu. From our puranic point of view, Viva Swan was the original entity. Manu was his son, and then the whole progeny starts and we end up here.\n\nIn this class I taught to Lord sun who is the originator of our world. Then he in turn taught to his sons. Obviously we always pass on our knowledge from us to our children. That's why we start teaching the little kids. And yesterday we were in the park and Medha always like to swing. The only way to stop her is say we're going to count one to hundred.\n\nSo in 100 you have to come down. That's okay, we start 1, 2. And she said no, we're going to count in Spanish. So she starts -- uno, dwe. Okay, after that what? Meda, after that what?\n\nBecause she has to tell us now. She knows because of Dora the Explorer. So we teach our children what we know. So Bhagavan said that Lord's son taught to his sons what he knew, this imperishable yoga. Then Manu in turn taught to his son. So Ishvaku, Ishwaku, we all know from Ramayana is the ancestor of Rama of the Sun Dynasty.\n\nSun Dynasty came from this lineage, whether we like this historically or not. But that's how the Puranas describe our lineage. The point here is very simple: right from the beginning of our ancestry, this knowledge was available to people. And those people passed it on from one generation to another through the leaders of the society. The leaders obviously in those days were kings.\n\nThey were the people who were leading the society. So if you read historically, Manu led these people from wherever they were to land which was safer and more fertile. Actually, Professor Bargha said that Noah is the same as Manu, because in Sanskrit Manu is \"Manu-hu.\" The people in the Arabic world only kept \"Nu.\" They dropped the \"Ma,\" and then \"Nu\" in the western world became Noah. So if you read the story of Noah's Ark, it is very similar to what we have in our Puranas about the Great Flood.\n\nSo we know that there's some connection somewhere where some ancestor left some land which was not very conducive and was flooding all the time, and led his people to somewhere safer. So he led his people to this. So he's our ancestor Manu Adi Manu. And whether he was the first human being is left to your imagination. We know for sure that he was the first Aryan king in this lineage of the Aryan kings who ruled Arya worth for ages.\n\nSo he said the first person to know this knowledge in this lineage, Manu. Manu in turn will give it to his sons. He came to Ishwaku who was the ancient king of Solar dynasty.",
      "reflection": "These opening verses of Chapter 4 reveal something profound: the wisdom Krishna shares with Arjuna is not new but imperishable (avyayam), passed from teacher to student since the beginning of creation. This knowledge was given first to Vivaswan (the Sun), then to Manu, then to Ikshvaku, forming an unbroken chain of transmission. Consider that you too are part of this lineage of seekers. The fact that this teaching has survived millennia, passed through royal sages and philosopher-kings, suggests it addresses something fundamental about human existence that transcends time and culture.\n\nKrishna reveals this supreme secret to Arjuna because he is both a devotee (bhakta) and a friend (sakha). This teaches us that spiritual knowledge is not merely intellectual but relational. Ask yourself today: Who are my spiritual teachers, formal or informal? Am I approaching this wisdom with the humility of a student and the openness of a friend? What ancient wisdom traditions have been passed to me through my own family, culture, or chosen path?\n\nAs a daily exercise, identify one piece of timeless wisdom you received from a parent, grandparent, or mentor. Reflect on how this \"imperishable knowledge\" has helped guide your actions. Consider how you might pass on such wisdom to others, becoming a link in the chain yourself. The goal of this teaching is to become actionless at the core, not dependent on the outside world for happiness, but reveling in your own Self (atmaratih)."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter four, Gnana Karma Sannyasa Yoga Yoga of Renouncing actions in Knowledge. So so far we have learnt in Bhagavad Gita that the sole goal of any being is happiness. And happiness we have seen is defined as absence of unhappiness. As long as there is unhappiness somewhere, I cannot be happy. Just like as we have seen, the cold is defined as absence of heat is cold. Darkness is defined as absence of light is darkness.\n\nHappiness is defined by lack of unhappiness. So my true nature is actually happiness. But the infusion of unhappiness creates this state which I call going back from happiness to unhappiness. When there is no unhappiness, I am happy. But if even one thing is wrong, no matter how many other things are going well in my life, it just won't let me focus on the good.\n\nIn Sastra it's called Kakadrasti. A crow is flying over a garden and everything is beautiful underneath. But the crow is not focusing on the beautiful flowers. He is focused on a carcass lying in that garden. That's where he goes. So our Kakadrasti --\n\nWe don't focus on what is right in our life, we focus on what is wrong in our life. So we have to get out of this habit of seeing what is not right in my life. So what we try to do is keep searching for happiness rather than avoiding unhappiness. The search of happiness leads us to believe that my actions will get me to happiness. So we act in this world to achieve happiness which is already with us. But these actions also lead me to results which are unhappiness.\n\nSo therefore we have seen in last chapter, Arjuna's question is Atha KE na prayuk toyam Papam Charati Purusha. There is no one in this life who really wants to become unhappy. And still we end up becoming unhappy by our own actions. So actions are at the root cause of whether I'm happy or unhappy. Therefore we need to understand what actions are all about. The one thing we learnt is I cannot live without actions, because action is the very nature of my own being.\n\nNature is part of Prakriti. It is one of the attributes of Prakriti is action Rajas. And as I am part of Prakriti, as this body, mind, intellect is part of Prakriti, action is a very signature of my being who I am. So actions I cannot avoid that's given. Now, how can I avoid actions which give me unhappiness? Well, when I am performing actions, there is not a single action I perform because I want to be unhappy.\n\n\"Well, let me do something that makes me unhappy. Let's see how it feels.\" There is no curiosity about unhappiness. I really don't want to know. But I still end up being unhappy. That's because I'm not understanding what actions are all about.\n\nSo we learnt in chapter three what actions are all about. The first thing we learnt is Yajnaarthaat Karmano, Nyatra Loko Yam Karma, Bandanaha. All actions are binding. If they are not performed for the Yajna, for the spirit of common good, then they are binding. If I am doing it for myself, they are binding. When those actions are binding, I'll be bound by the results.\n\nIn a sense, I really don't know what the results would be. They may come back as conducive results and I'll be happy or they come back as unconducive results and I'll be unhappy. So now I am in a conundrum. I want to act because that's what's going to make me happy. But also I'm not quite confident that my actions will make me happy. Because I have no control over my actions.\n\nSo there got to be a way to get out of this conundrum of acting and reacting and then acting again. So Bhagavan said yes, there is a yoga, the Yoga of Knowledge. Once the knowledge takes place that I am not the actor, you will be released from this bondage of actions. Because you are not performing the actions, you cannot be bound by it. So that is Gnana Karma Sannyasa Yoga. Yoga of renouncing actions in knowledge.\n\nWhen knowledge takes place that I am not the actor. Guna Gunesuvartantaha Ithimatva na Sajjadhai. We learned that in chapter three. Once I figure out that the actions are only taking place at the Prakriti level -- by my qualities, qualities of my body, mind and intellect, and qualities of the rest of the universe -- when they come in contact with each other, they react with each other. Like hydrogen and oxygen: when they are two independently standing, there is no water.\n\nWhen they come together, they create water. We also work in this world the same way. By ourselves we are not reacting to anything. As soon as we come in contact with another being or an object, we react. There was sometimes we had good chemistry with him. What do you mean good chemistry?\n\nI like him with no reason. Guna Gunesuvaratanta. I detect Gunas in him or her. Maybe a physical, mental, intellectual, something which I like. I tell people how I got into hotel designing business. Very first limited hotel.\n\nI had designed full service hotels in my life before I came to Virginia. But then I was looking for some work. Somebody says there is an Indian community. They design lot of mid level hotel. He said no, no, you're a big time, not small time. So the first guy they introduced me was in Charlottesville.\n\nThey said, \"How about you come down here?\" Because one thing I figured out: I can win people over if I'm in front of them -- on the phone and in writing it's harder. But if I'm in front of him I can probably have a better chance. So I go down there, talk to the guy, and then he said, \"Where are you from?\" I said Surat.\n\n\"My parents actually come from Randeh.\" \"Oh, where is Randeir?\" In the end of the day, we never talked about what I know about architecture. They said, \"You are my architect now because your ancestors come from Randir. Let the architecture sort out by itself. You are my architect.\"\n\nSomething we find common. So therefore these actions are all bound by Gunas. But we consider it to be ours. The Bhagawan said that one who is understanding this he will not be attached to his actions. He doesn't get attached. But how do I get to that point that I don't get attached.\n\nI have to have knowledge who I am. So this chapter starts with Bhagavan said that I taught this yoga to Vivaswan. Then the Viva swan taught to Manu. Then Manu taught to Iksvaku. And thus by lineage the knowledge was passed on to generation to generation. But now because the long time has passed the knowledge is lost.\n\nWhen were Vivaswan and Manu alive? And you are now telling me that you taught them? We have discussed that Vivaswan and Manu, from a genealogical point of view, are Krishna's ancestors. Vivaswan's son was Manu, who at the time of Pralaya saved his family and seven Rishis. Manu's son was Ikswaku. So Vivaswan taught his son Manu.\n\nManu taught his son Ishvaku. And Isvaku, we know, is Rama's ancestor who established the kingdom in Ayodhya. Somewhere about 36 generations later, Rama comes. One of them was also the ancestor of Krishna. Somewhere in the 60th generation, Krishna comes. So Arjuna is saying: you are telling me that you taught all your ancestors?\n\nSo then Bhagavan said Bahuni me Vyati Thani Janmani Stavacharjuna Tani Aham Veda Sarwani Natvam Vedaparam Tapa. This is not the only life that you and I know, Arjuna. You know me in this life as Krishna. But I have taken so many births before and so did you. The only difference is I know them all. This is a very bold presentation of concept of reincarnation.\n\nIt was not that it was not introduced before. It was introduced in chapter 2. Vasamsi Jinini Yatavi Haya Navani Guru Nathi Naroparani we have already seen that this self is immutable, imperishable. It just takes one state of existence to another depending on. We know from our study of Bhagavadya by Karma actions. Our actions create experiences in this world.\n\nThese experiences create tendencies. These tendencies create likes and dislikes and desires. And to fulfill those desires we take a next state of existence. My desire was to become a rock star. Then obviously I learned music and then march on that path. So desire leads us to where we are today.\n\nBut you see, we won't remember how we got here. The one who is very aware of this transitory nature of things, he will remember all of them. See, some of us are very good at remembering dreams. All of us remember dreams, right? Some of my dreams, even ones I had in childhood, I still remember. They either still scare me or still fascinate me.\n\nBut I don't remember all my dreams. If I was more aware and enlightened about keeping myself connected to my dream world, then I would remember all my dreams. See, right now I'm only connected to my waking world, and sporadically I'm connected to my dream world. So I remember some dreams here and there, but not all of them. In the waking world, I think I remember everything. Then somebody says, \"But Neil, you did this?\"\n\nNo, I don't remember. I forget almost everything she says I did. She said, \"You did this for some reason.\" Women are very historical. They remember everything. From the day I met Meena till today, she remembers everything that I did not do right.\n\nAnd I don't remember any of that. But you remember what she didn't do, right? So we have very, what you call it is a convenient memory. But at least I'm connected to the waking world. If I'm disconnected, then I will have to have a psychiatric evaluation because I don't remember who I am and all the good stuff. Now imagine: if I'm connected to the waking world, and if I'm also connected to my dream world, and then also my deep sleep, then I will remember everything.\n\nBut for that I have to be a third party, not involved in it. Imagine there is a recording device which is recording everything going on in my brain. It will record everything. See, that's why when we see some recordings of our own childhood, we get fascinated. \"Did I look like that?\" So we have a memory which is very specific to time and space.\n\nThe time and space we are in. This is what remember as the reality. But if there is some way we can connect all our realities then we will have a complete view. Bhagawan said that you and I both have the capability to know that. But ignorance about who I am has created a smaller memory. The more I identify with the localized situation,\n\nthe more I will forget about my greater situation. Some of my friends still write me every year, and I have forgotten most of them, because my nature is to identify with wherever I am now. I'm in Richmond. These are my friends and my family. The more I identify with Richmond, the more I'll forget my friends in Northern Virginia and Houston and Nairobi and Zambia and India. But some people remain connected because they never fully belong to where they are.\n\nThey may ask somebody and say, what are you doing? We go to Northern Virginia every weekend. We have all our friends there. They are not connected here, they are more connected there.",
      "reflection": "When Arjuna questions how Krishna could have taught Vivaswan who was born ages before, Krishna reveals a profound truth: \"Many births have passed for Me and for you, O Arjuna. I know them all, but you know them not\" (bahuni me vyatitani janmani tava charjuna). This teaching on reincarnation invites us to consider the continuity of our existence beyond this single lifetime. Just as we remember some dreams vividly while forgetting most, our connection to past experiences depends on our level of awareness. Krishna, being fully aware, remembers all; we, identified with our limited selves, remember only fragments.\n\nThe key distinction Krishna makes is that while we take birth compelled by unfulfilled desires (vasanas), He manifests by His own free will (atma-mayaya), presiding over His own Prakriti. Though unborn (ajo) and imperishable (avyayatma), He appears in creation by choice, not compulsion. This teaches us that our bondage comes from identification with limited circumstances, while liberation comes from recognizing our true nature as the unchanging witness.\n\nToday, reflect on your patterns of attachment and desire. What recurring themes appear in your life that might point to deep-seated tendencies (vasanas)? Practice expanding your sense of identity beyond your current circumstances. Just as people who keep connected to friends from different cities never feel fully \"local\" anywhere, consider: are you so identified with your present situation that you have forgotten your larger Self? Try maintaining awareness of yourself as the witness who observes all experiences rather than the one caught up in them."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter four, Gnana Karma Sannyasa Yoga, Yoga of Renunciation of Action in Knowledge. We have seen so far that in chapter three, Bhagavan has taught Arjuna Karma Yoga. In that he said that you should perform actions for Yajna Yajnarth Puru Karmani. Then he also said, asaktah Sattattam Karma Samajaraha. Perform all your actions without attachment. And he said, yogastha Guru Karmani, establish your Sulmi Yoga and they perform your actions.\n\nSo these are the three requisites or three path. Three ways of performing actions Bhagavan has indicated to Arjuna and he called it Karma Yoga. How you can continue performing your actions in this world as required by roles you are taken. The art of performing action called Karma Yoga. Bhagavan Seth was taught to the royal sages, the philosopher kings, right from the beginning. Right from the beginning of the creation.\n\nThis knowledge was given to Lord sun, who is considered to be in this case, the original ruler of this universe. He then gave it to his successor. His successor gave it to his successor. And this knowledge was passed on one royal sage to the another, one philosopher king, to another philosopher king. You know, kings were not just simply the rulers, but they were also established in Dharma. They were established in the knowledge.\n\nBut this knowledge was lost over a period of time. And therefore I have given it to you again today, and you shall also be able to use it. But then Arjuna asked, how can that be possible? Because you are under my contemporary, how you could give this knowledge to Lord Son. And in that response we all learned how the reincarnation works. So Bhagavan said, bahuni me vyati Thani Janma ne tava Charjana.\n\nOh Arjuna, you and I have gone through many, many Janmas, many, many iterations of our existence. The only difference, he is saying that I know them all and you do not know any. That's because you take birth. I, as a Jiva, take birth, compelled by my own vasanas. My unfulfilled desires. I take a new instrument to fulfill my vasanas which I have not fulfilled yet.\n\nIf I have no vasanas, no desires, there is no reason for me to take birth. In other words, there is no action required if there is no desire. I don't need to buy a car if I am never going to travel. People in New York City, most of them don't buy car because they are not going to use car. It's not economical for them to bike. They don't need that equipment.\n\nPeople like us, we need that equipment. Because there is only way we can travel from one place to another. We have desire to travel. The equipment needed is a car. Therefore, I'll buy a car. In the same way you are driven by your own vasanas, take another birth.\n\nBut in my case, there is no need for me. But I take birth by my own free will because I have a desire. And that is what Bhagavan has basically said. Why he takes that divine birth. He said, yada yada hi dharmasyagnanir Bhavati Bharata abyuthanam adharmashya tad atmanam srujami ham. The desire may be noble, it may be good or bad.\n\nBut unless there is desire, there cannot be any action swimming in Bhagavan's part also from Ishwara's point of view also he has a desire to set the creation right. When he sees that the Dharma is declining in his own creation, as we have seen in Vedantic discussions, then Bhagavan creates this universe out of his own self. The Creator is the efficient cause, knows how to create. He also knows how to maintain it. But the material he used to create this universe, his own self, he has created this universe out of his own self. So he is all pervading in this universe.\n\nAnd he has created this universe out of his own will. Maya when he sees that his own creation, there is a decay of Dharma. Dharma we have seen in several discussions before is the law of being. That which makes a thing or a being what it is is its Dharma. If that Dharma is declining, a thing or being is not functioning as it should be, then it needs to be corrected. So here Bhagavan said, when in the society, just as an individual has a Dharma, the society also has a Dharma.\n\nHuman beings have their own Dharma. At the basic core level, a human being is a rational animal. He is differentiated from all other animals by his reasoning power. So he can act rationally, he can think rationally. If human beings stop acting rationally, then Dharma is decayed. If they start acting irrationally, I will say Dharma is decayed for human beings, for that society.\n\nSo it's been current condition, the Dharma of democracy is that everyone has the right to vote or right to give opinion. When that Dharma is violated, then democracy is decayed and somebody has to come and correct it. So in this case, Bhagavan said, whenever there is a decay of Dharma, when I see that things are not performing as per Dharma, then it has to be replaced, corrected, and the order should be restored. To give you an example from my own observation: the Dharma of a steel beam under a bridge is to provide the tensile strength to that bridge. Because that beam can bend and come back to its own position -- that is the Dharma of steel. When the steel is corroded, it's still steel, but it's corroded steel.\n\nThat steel does not have the tensile strength which was required by that beam, and therefore it needs to be either repaired or replaced. Whoever is responsible for that bridge may be paying no attention to that beam. But now that he has observed the decay, there's a danger of the bridge collapsing. Well, he has to manifest himself as the corrector for that steel beam. So he said, yada yada, hi Dharma Siglanir Bhavati.\n\nWhenever Dharma has decayed, that things or beings are not acting according to their own Dharma. Abhiuthana Madharma and the rise of Adharma Adharma, which is contrary to his own Dharma. Human beings are supposed to be rational. They are not acting rationally. They are no different than any other animals. Society has to be just.\n\nIf the society is not just, obviously it is not a society. If there is a chaos in the society, whoever is responsible for their society has to restore the order in the society. It becomes a just society again. Bhagawan said, that is my desire when I take birth by my free will. So we have seen that we are under the spell of Maya. Therefore, we are deluded by ignorance.\n\nIgnorance is veiling my own self. I do not see who I am. I continue to change my vehicle from this body to another. But that's driven by my vasanas. Ishwara is in control of Maya. The whole creation is created by his own Maya out of his own self.\n\nWhen he sees this creation is not performing as per his design, he has the desire to set it right. Paritranaya Sadhunam Vinashaya Chaduskritam, Dharma, Sansthapa, Narthaya, Sambhavami, Yuge Yuge. Time and again I manifest myself as one of my own creation and then set the order correct so that the things which are working as per Dharma are protected, and those which are not acting according to Dharma either need to be corrected, rehabilitated, or replaced. So in the same example of my steel beam under a bridge, there are several steel beams under that bridge. Those are providing the tensile strength to that bridge.\n\nPeople don't pay much attention. Corroded beams we see all the time. When we see extensive corrosion under that bridge, then whoever is in charge says, \"We need to do something.\" Well, let's figure out which beams we can restore and which we have to replace, so that the overall strength of that bridge is restored back to where it should have been.\n\nDharmasansthapa Narthaya -- for society to function as it was supposed to have functioned, as a just society, then I have to come and restore order: remove those who are poisonous and cannot be rehabilitated, rehabilitate those who can be rehabilitated, so that those who are practicing Dharma are protected and society functions as it was supposed to before the decay started. In verse nine, he says, Arjuna.\n\nHere is another method Bhagavan gives us to achieve that state of knowledge. Right now I am under the spell of Maya and my knowledge is veiled by my ignorance. There are several methods. We have seen Gnana Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Karma Yoga. He said that in Karma Yoga, you can perform your actions as we have discussed. Or you can just observe a divine person acting in this world selflessly, recognize how he does it in his divine manifestation, and then find the same divinity within you. You will establish yourself in your own real self, which is your own atma, your own consciousness. As we have discussed, there is nothing in this world which is not a manifestation of Bhagavan, of Brahman.\n\nAnd therefore you and I cannot be different from Avatara. In our culture we have this Dasha Avatara, but actually that's just the popular version of it. Some Puranas have 24 Avataras, some have 36. There are numerous descriptions of Avatara, because Avatara means \"the one who descends\" -- Avatarati ITI Avatara. You and I also have descended from our highest position of all-knowing self to very limited knowing self.\n\nFrom these limitations, I want liberation. Bhagavan said, even by observing others, so we create role models in our life, from them we learn. And if I can create the highest role model which has demonstrated how a person established in his own self acts in this world. Bhagawan said, you can also get liberated just by recognizing how a divine incarnation functions. Janma, Karma, Chame Divyam Evam yo Vittita tv. One who knows in essence what is the purpose of a divine Avatara and how that divine being functions in this world.\n\nTherefore we learn Ramayana, therefore we recite Bhagavad Gita. We are trying to learn from them how Lord Rama acted in his life. If we can understand that, Bhagavan says, then when you give up this body -- if I understood in my life how Rama functioned, what was his motivation to act the way he acted, what was Krishna's motivation -- then I will also find that same self in me through my own contemplation, my own observation of my own self: that this is not me. The demands of my body, my mind, intellect are not really me. I am something other than that.\n\nHaving understood this by learning from my own role models, when I give up this body, I don't have to take the birth again. So Swamiji explains here that in previous descriptions in scriptures, the idea was deathlessness. But then the later portion of our scriptures describes birthlessness instead. Death is obviously something to be afraid of -- therefore don't get infected by coronavirus, social distancing, all of that. Death is the one thing you are worried about.\n\nBut somehow we are going to die anyway, coronavirus or no coronavirus. The very thought that I will start all over again -- I have come all this far, from learning ABCD to whatever, went through kindergarten, then high school, then college -- and I have to start all over again.",
      "reflection": "These verses contain the famous promise of divine intervention: \"Yada yada hi dharmasya glanir bhavati\" - whenever Dharma declines and Adharma rises, the Lord manifests to protect the righteous, destroy wickedness, and re-establish Dharma. This is not merely about cosmic events but applies to our inner life as well. Just as a gardener tolerates a few weeds but eventually must restore order, the divine principle within us rises to correct imbalance when we stray too far from our essential nature.\n\nDharma here means the law of being - that which makes a thing what it is. When a steel beam loses its tensile strength through corrosion, it has lost its dharma and must be repaired or replaced. Similarly, when we deviate from our own authentic nature, life itself creates situations that call us back to alignment. The teaching also reveals that one who truly understands the divine birth and actions (janma karma cha me divyam) becomes free from the cycle of rebirth. This is not mere intellectual understanding but a profound recognition that transforms one's entire being.\n\nToday, examine where in your life Dharma may be declining - where are you not functioning according to your true nature? What corrective forces have appeared to guide you back? Also reflect: Bhagavan says He comes \"paritranaya sadhunam\" - to protect those practicing Dharma. What good thoughts or intentions within you need protection from being overwhelmed by negative tendencies? Trust that when you sincerely seek to follow Dharma, the inner voice of guidance will strengthen and rise to support you. The goal is birthlessness (aja) - to exhaust all desires so completely that no new birth is needed."

      "commentary": "Chapter 4 Gnana Karma Sannyasi Yoga of Ending Karma in Knowledge. We all want to retire, but there is no real practical way to retire. You always do something. You can only retire mentally. So when you don't take your actions to be work, you retire, then you enjoy this. So when we change our mental attitude about our actions, then you retire from the actions.\n\nSo the only way Bhagavan says to end your actions because these actions are binding and I want to get out of this bondage. He said, you have to get rid of your actions. You have to retire from your actions. And the only way to retire is in the knowledge of who you are and what actions are all about. So in chapter three we have seen Karma Yoga and see how to gradually liberate yourself from your actions by changing your attitude towards actions. And now you say, well, how can I then completely relieve myself of this burden is to realize who I am.\n\nSo this chapter talks about what is the nature of the self. Ajaha Pisan Avya Yatman. I yourself, Ajaha Unborn, Avyatma, immutable, imperishable. That's the real nature of mind. Bhutanam Isvaropisan. I am the lord of all beings.\n\nAll beings are beings because of my presence in them. I am who I am and you are who you are. And the donkey is who donkey is. Because that life which is pulsating through them, the presence of that omnipresent self makes people who they are and beings who they are. That's why he is the lord of all the beings. Lordship is someone who has a control over my life is my lord in feudal system.\n\nThe guy who owned the estate was a lord. Even today he's a landlord and a renter. He has the control over your property. Therefore he's a landlord. So he is the Bhutana Mishurabeesan. Prakrutin swam this tyre.\n\nYou and I come into existence because of the Self. But because of the Maya we think we are individual egos, we are the individuals. But someone who has a complete identification with himself, he realizes this is just an appearance. It's just an illusion that I have taken a limited form. So the difference between us and the Avatar is we think we are limited. Avatar knows all the time.\n\nHis role in this life is limited. So Krishna can say, I am unlimited. He knew his role in this life, but he never bound himself with his role. He said that presiding over my prakriti, I come time and again to regulate Dharma. Hi Dharma Siglanir Bhavati. Dharma itself is a self regulating principle.\n\nYou don't really need to do anything about Dharma water. You don't have to train water to seek its own level because it's self regulating. My Dharma is also self regulating. So when I get out of my Dharma, I cease to be what I was. I'll become something else. When I came to this country, there were no jobs for architecture because I came in 82 and there was a recess in time.\n\nSo there were no jobs. So people said, Neil, the best thing you can do. And I was in Houston at the time, so the oil economy was still tail end of it. The best thing, if you can become a pipe designer, pipe drafting, pipe drafting. Pipe drafting is a lot of money. So compared to architecture, you do pipe drafting, all those pipes for the oil company, you will make more money.\n\nAnd I said, no matter how much money there is, I won't be able to do it. That's my Dharma to design building. I can't design pipes. I may have to suffer through unemployment. As long as I don't get a job, I'll do something else. But by very nature, I'm an architect.\n\nI have to design buildings. And then I finally somewhere I worked for some contractor. I think you will do very well if you continue in the contracting. I left the job right away. He is going to deviate me from my Dharma. So what is your Dharma if I stop being an architect or stop designing buildings?\n\nI'm not an architect. It's as simple as that. So Dharma is a self regulating principle. To remain who I am, I have to remain in that Dharma. As soon as I deviate from that Dharma, Dharma itself, eliminate me from that existence, stop practicing architecture, I'll be eliminated from architectural societies, architectural communities, all the architectural duties and responsibilities. I'm not something else.\n\nSo Bhagwan says, yada yada, Hi Dharma Seglani R. Bhavati. In this world, a role is assigned to each thing and being. If they deviate from the Dharma, I will eliminate them. As the regulating principle, to be the agency that does this, I will take Avatara. I will be a catalyst to make the change for those who are deviating from the Dharma. To eliminate from that society, that community, that part of this universe.\n\nAbyutthanam, adharmasyatadhatmanam sujam. When there is a rise of Adharma, a lot of people are thinking that this is Dharma, but actually it's Adharma. So when that happens, when Dharma is misunderstood by beings and people, as the last time we have discussed, it's only for human beings because we have free will that we can deviate from our Dharma. We can be vegetarians and also can be non vegetarians. We don't know whether we were designed as vegetarians or not. Elephant knows he is designed as vegetarian.\n\nLion knows he is designed as carnivore. Because of our free will, we deviate from our Dharma when it becomes unbearable for the society. Swamiji used to say that you also, you know, surjami aham. During springtime, you see, when there are few weeds in your garden, you see, it's okay. You don't pay much attention to it. Then gradually your yard becomes filled with weeds.\n\nThen less grass and more weeds. Then one Sunday, you put on your yard work clothes and say, I need to take care of this. You will tolerate it to a point. Let the weeds have good time. And then one Sunday you say, no, this is it or the protection of the grass. Vina Sahaja duskritam all the way.\n\nSo time and again you, as the Lord will come and set your yard right. Bhagawan said this, in my yard, I have to do the same thing. Paritra Naya Sadhunam Vinasaya. Somebody asked Swamijuman. They say, but if that's the case, why Bhagavan is not coming now? He said, Bhagavan clearly says Paritra Naya, Sadhuna.\n\nIf lesser evil is fighting with greater evil, Bhagavan has nothing to do with it. Let them figure it out how to kill each other. They will eliminate each other automatically. Bhagavan doesn't have to interfere. It is only that evil is not letting the good practice good. Then only Bhagavan comes.\n\nIn our case, it's a lesser evil fighting greater evil. It's still evil in the end. Therefore, he said, Bhagavan doesn't have to come yet. Dharma Sasthapanaarthaya. To establish Dharma again. As I said, it's a self regulating principle.\n\nIt will time and again it will reset Dharma so that the cycle will continue as it was designed. We take our car once in a while for tune up and wheel alignment. We tolerate it to a point. When it starts making noise while you're driving, I need to take it to the garage and calibrate it. So that is a self regulating principle to calibrate itself. Because time and again it gets out of its alignment.\n\nAnd Bhagawan said, I as the self. I created this universe out of my own self, out of my own Maya. And I let it run through its own laws. The laws of nature are self regulating. So we don't have to control whatever the law of gravity and all that. We don't want to get up in the morning.\n\nLet's make sure the law of gravity is working. Otherwise how I'm going to go down to the staircase. Because suddenly if I try to go down, I start flying into the ceiling. So I have to be very conscious that law of gravity is working every day. No, we don't have to. But my own behavior I have to regulate.\n\nBecause I have free will. I can be doing right. I also can be doing wrong. My free will is guided my mind and intellect and my mind and intellect can deceive me in doing something which is not right. I say I should not be doing this. But the mind will put an argument and say no.\n\nOther people are doing it. So what's wrong in it then? Everybody's doing it. Cheating on 1040 because other people are doing it. I come to think that it's okay. But my conscience tell me it's not right.\n\nBut my mind and intellect will say that's okay. And that's what I suffer. So Bhagawan says, that's why I have to time and again rise in your own heart as your own inner voice. If I have few good thoughts which are still trying to direct me toward the right path, but many bad thoughts are avoiding me to exercise my right to follow the good thoughts, then that voice will rise in my heart. Because at least those good thoughts were propelling me to find what is right. So that's what Bhagawan said.\n\nI will rise in your heart as your avatar. And that will redeem you from the Wrong that you are going to do, when will that happen? Janma Karma Chame Divyam evam yo Vidya Takvatah -- when you will realize that in its essence, I am the divine being, that this life is divine, given to me for learning to rise out of limitations. Once I realize what is the real truth, what is my real nature, then when I get out of this existence, when I exhaust all the vasanas and karmas of this existence, I will not take a new birth. If last time I experienced something and that was not really enjoyable, I somehow suffered through that experience. But then what will I do next?\n\nI don't want to go there again ever. Because I realized that this is a painful existence. It is when we go back and forth I enjoyed some but suffer some. So let me go for the enjoyment in the bargain I also suffer. So that's why we have Punarabi Janamam Punarapi Maranam because our attachments are taking us back to that existence Even though we suffered through it we forget at times that there will be sufferings also attached to this pleasures. But once I realize my divine nature is omnipresence and omnipotence, I will get out of this Punarjanma.\n\nSo Tektvadeham Punarjunmati Saharjuna -- he comes to being my own self. The technique is now given, and we have discussed before that the root cause is attachment, and its byproducts are Raga, Bhaya and Krodha. Raga (attachment) is the root cause; Bhaya (fear) and Krodha (anger) are the byproducts. Once I realize that's the root cause, if I start getting out of attachment, fear and anger will not be there.\n\nHe said therefore the goal is to get rid of attachment. But I can't get rid of attachment unless I take refuge in something higher. Maam Upa Sri Tah -- one who takes refuge in \"me.\" Then that \"me\" is the \"I\" that I keep reciting all my life.\n\nIf I take refuge in my \"I\" and do not rely on my body, mind and intellect to give me the peace and happiness which I am seeking, then I will be liberated. Liberated from attachment. Once I am liberated from attachment, I will be liberated from fear and anger. Bahavogna Tapasa Puta Madbhavam Agatha -- again we have to be reminded: you are not the guinea pig.",
      "reflection": "These verses reveal the path to liberation through the purification of attachment, fear, and anger (vita-raga-bhaya-krodha). Many have attained the divine state by taking refuge in the Lord and becoming purified by the fire of knowledge (jnana-tapasa puta). The root cause is attachment (raga), with fear and anger being its byproducts. Krishna teaches that by releasing attachment and taking refuge in the higher Self (mam upashritah), one becomes free from these binding emotions.\n\nThe beautiful verse \"ye yatha mam prapadyante tams tathaiva bhajamy aham\" reveals the universal nature of grace: however people approach the Divine, in that very manner does the Divine respond. All paths ultimately lead to the same destination. However, those seeking quick, measurable results in this world worship various powers and deities, because worldly success is easily visible and attainable. The challenge is that attachment to these results creates further bondage.\n\nFor daily practice, identify the primary attachments driving your actions today. Are you pursuing something because of genuine dharma or because you seek quick, visible results? Notice when fear or anger arise - trace them back to the underlying attachment. Practice the teaching \"mam upashritah\" - taking refuge in your own higher Self rather than in external outcomes. Ask yourself: Can I remain in my authentic nature (like an architect who refuses to design pipes because it is not his dharma) even when external pressures push me otherwise? When you find yourself attached to outcomes, remind yourself that the Self within is actionless, unborn, and Lord of all beings (bhutanam ishvaro'pi san)."

      "commentary": "What is my purpose and destiny? We had been discussing chapter four, Jnana Karma Sannyasa Yoga, Yoga of Renunciation of actions in Knowledge. This is all about knowledge, all about what the real I is. So far in chapters two and three, Bhagavan has been saying that what I consider to be \"I\" is not the real I, but that which is permanent, that which is Ajaha (unborn), that which is immortal -- that is me. Chapter three talked about Karma Yoga: how do I act in this world and not get bound by those actions? Chapter four continues that same theme: how do I act in this world but not get bound by my actions?\n\nSo the first thing Bhagavan says, Ajaha PI, I am unborn. He clarifies first that let's keep in mind that what's the theme of our discussion? Our theme of our discussion is from chapter two onward is I am unborn. Avya Yatma Immutable. There is no change ever takes place in the self. The supreme self which is all pervading.\n\nSwamiji gives a commentary here that in the early part of Vedic literature there was a great emphasis on immortality. No death, deathlessness. He said that in the later part of this Vedic literature they switched on to Aja. Unbornness, birthlessness. So all of our stories about the Devas are looking for nectar Amrit. There is always a fear of death.\n\nOver a period of time they realized it's not the death you should be worried about, it is the birth you should be worried about. As long as there is birth, there will be death. Only way you can overcome death is by not having birth. That's where it all started, because of my birth that I am now afraid of death. If I achieve the birthlessness, deathlessness I already achieved. So therefore Bhagavan clarifies very first declaration in this chapter is Ajaha Apisan, I am unborn.\n\nNo mutation ever takes place in myself. Now obviously Bhagavan is speaking from the highest perspective of the all pervading self. But we have also seen that our own self is no different than his self. This room space is no different than the space outside. Before this building was built, this space was nothing but the continuation of the space outside. I created this conditioning called walls, floor and ceiling.\n\nNow this same space is part of the universal space, but I consider it to be a separate room space. So all the qualities of the space outside still remain intact in the room space. But in my perception, they're conditioned by the walls, floor and ceiling. In my own existence, it is something similar. The self which is all pervading in my own self are exactly same.\n\nThe qualities attributed to the Supreme Self are also valid for my own self. So the first thing is Ajahapi son. I am unborn as the Supreme Self. Therefore my own self is also unborn. No mutation ever took place. Space never get contaminated by or affected by bad designs.\n\nWe design buildings, not all of them are good. So we jokingly say the doctors bury their mistakes. What do we architects do? We put it out there for the world to see every time we pass it. Who the heck designed this thing? But the space in a good building or a bad building are not affected by an architect's design.\n\nIt remains immutable, imperishable. This place was not brought from Hanover County. It will never be transported back to Hanover County. So he said, I am unborn. Therefore you are unborn. No mutation ever took place.\n\nBut Bhutanam Isvaropi son. But I am still the Lord of all the beings. Beings are beings because of my presence. And they are created out of my Maya. It is my Maya which created this universe out of my own self. There was no other material available to Bhagavan when he created this universe other than his own self.\n\nBut if you say there are other material existing, he is limited. He is no more unlimited. So if he is unlimited, you have to accept that there was no other material ever available to him to create this universe. And therefore the material he used to create this universe is nothing but his own self. That self, he says, is immutable. No change ever took place in it.\n\nOnly in your perception. Out of your ignorance. Out of my ignorance, I create my world and identify with this body, mind and intellectual. Just as we walk into this room, we identify this space with this room and say, this room is too low, Ceiling is not too good. Neeli should have made some ceiling or higher. Because we are affected by the conditioning, our perception affected by the conditioning.\n\nSame way Bhagavan said that Bhutana mi swopishan. All beings are who they are because of my presence. This room exists because of room space. Just walls, floor and ceiling does not make the room. The heart of this room is the space in the room. Without space, there is no room.\n\nWithout self, there is no being. So Bhagavan said, I am Isvar. I am the Lord of all beings. However, this universe I have put forth according to its own dharma. Maya has its own Dharma. Sattvarajas and Tamas, those gunas and Dharmas are inherent in this universe.\n\nAnd when there is a decay of this Dharma, when those Dharmas decline, I as the Creator, will set it back. I will participate actively in the creation. To set the creation back to as I design, time and again, we renovated my building. I designed something. After a while it gets deteriorated. We just change carpet in my front room.\n\nBecause when I designed in 2004, I had a perception what the room looks like. Over time, the carpet got soiled. I have to the architect again and say, change the carpet. Now it looks the way I have thought in my mind before. So Bhagawan said the same way, I come back again. Yadayadahi Dharma seglanir Bhavati.\n\nWhen the essential Dharma of this universe gets out of line, then I take active participation. Just as I took active participation in creating this universe. I'll set the universe back to its Dharma. Paritra naya Sadhunam, Vina saya chaduskritam. Whatever went out of Dharma, I will eliminate. And then whatever is in line with Dharma and protect it.\n\nSo the Dharma principle will be restored. And as I said, Dharma is a self regulating principle. As soon as you get out of your Dharma, you lost your existence. As soon as sugar loses its sweetness. If you put sugar on frying pan and it becomes black, and now you put in your mouth, it's not sweet. It lost its existence because it's lost its Dharma.\n\nYou won't call it sugar anymore. So Bhagavan says, as soon as the Dharma gets out of line, the thing or being loses its existence. I destroy them by very fact that the Dharma is lost. So he said, therefore I come back again and again, every time. So I assure you that my creation will always remain as I have designed. The will of Dharma makes it function.\n\nAnd then he said that every being still has to continue working. All beings who are working, they're working in my path alone. No matter what I am doing or you are doing, she is doing, he is doing -- everybody is functioning because of that consciousness in them. They are living beings. Dead, Einstein cannot invent anything. As long as they are alive, they create.\n\nAnd whether I am going in the right direction or wrong direction in terms of my goals in life, as long as I take the support of my consciousness, it will allow me to go in the direction which I think is appropriate. That is because of the equipment that I have.\n\nThe equipment which I have will decide what direction I will take. My mind, my intellect, my body will determine what actions I am taking and what direction I will take. Whatever my desires are. Therefore Kanksutta Karmanam Siddhi Ijanti IHA Devataha. Because we want success in this life. We want success which is miserable success.\n\nSomething which I can show people and say this is what I did in last 4 years, 5 years, 10 years. So what we'll do is something. If say this is some pie in the sky type of a goal, I don't really pursue it. I want to pursue something which is I can show the result to the world. In this world getting results of your actions are easy and measurable and showable. Therefore Bhagavan says Kangsadha Karmanam Siddhi Ijanti Ihadvattaha.\n\nTherefore we pursue those senses. Because I think I will get the results which I can enjoy. The whole goal I have is to enjoy the fruits of my actions. I do not want to perform any action which I already know. There is no result for it. If I know that I can keep working in this company and they won't ever promote me or will ever recognize my work.\n\nWhat is the normal advice? You better leave this company or find someplace else where you work and get results. So my fruits of actions are driving me. Therefore people are pursuing different paths based on what they think will give them those results. My field is different than yours, and your field is different than hers. Next verse says Chaturvarnam Mayasrishtam Guna Karmaha Vibhagashah Kartaram Aphima Vidhi Kartaram Avyam.\n\nThis is not a social commentary on Indian caste system. This book was not written to have a commentary on whether a caste system is right or wrong. This book is a commentary about yourself. It's a self development book. Gita was not written for you to learn and then teach other people. Gita was designed for you to learn yourself and make progress.\n\nNow I don't know why I am putting these efforts in this field and not Going in. Why did I go to architecture school? I should have been smart enough to figure out that time that I should be there. Medical or maybe some business or Wall street type of commerce. Nobody wanted to go in commerce. In my days, MBA wasn't even invented.\n\nI think it was there but nobody knew. Nobody ever told me, Neil, you can be mba. So only three options. I had you become a doctor. That's your first choice. Second was a chemical engineer, the second choice.\n\nAnd third, either electrical or civil engineering. After that, no choice really. After that, BA, BA, BCom -- no value. Nobody told me that if you go to Commerce, Neil, and become a Wall Street banker, you'll be much better off than becoming an architect. Why did you follow what you followed?\n\nChaturvananyamaya Sristam Guna Karma Vibhaga Saha. Looking at the mental moods of people, you can say that the entire human race can be divided into four classifications.\n\nAnd Bhagwan says I created them. I'm taking full responsibility. Don't think that it was by accident that people are different from each other. Guna Karma Vibhaga Sah. They need to be complementary. This society cannot function.\n\nIf all want to be architects, there won't be any clients. If I want to play a cop and robber game, somebody has to be the cop and somebody the robber, right? To play the game, I have to have both characters. To make this universe function, I need all the ingredients needed for this universe. To make the human race function, I need all types of people to make human society possible.",
      "reflection": "Krishna declares that the four-fold order of society was created by Him according to the natural distribution of qualities (gunas) and actions (karma). Yet immediately He adds: \"Though I am the author of this, know Me as the non-doer, immutable\" (tasya kartaram api mam viddhy akartaram avyayam). This is a profound teaching on the nature of the Self - actions take place, creation happens, yet the Self remains actionless. Just as space is not affected by good or bad architecture within it, the Self remains untainted by whatever occurs in body, mind, and intellect.\n\nThe key to freedom lies in understanding \"na mam karmani limpanti na me karma-phale spriha\" - actions do not taint Me, nor do I have desire for their fruits. Without desire for results, there can be no attachment, and without attachment, no bondage. This is not about the four castes of Indian society but about the four types of mental temperaments found in every society and within each individual. We each have qualities suited for different roles, and living according to our natural disposition (svadharma) is the path to harmony.\n\nToday, reflect on your own natural temperament and tendencies. What type of work aligns with your inherent qualities? Are you forcing yourself into roles that contradict your nature, like trying to make a lecture hall into a concert hall? Practice viewing your actions as Krishna describes His own: you are the apparent author, yet at your core, you remain the actionless witness. When you catch yourself anxious about results, remember that the sufferer and enjoyer is only the ego - the body, mind, and intellect. The Self within you, like space within a room, remains forever free and unchanged."

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter four, Gnana Karma Sannyasa Yoga -- Yoga of Renouncing Actions in Knowledge. It's all about knowledge. It's all about Karma. So the first thing we have seen in this chapter is where Bhagavan gave his identity: my nature is that I'm unborn. And because his nature is Ajaha, the nature of myself is also Ajaha -- unborn.\n\nBut as long as I am in this life, that will continue performing actions. So also I need to understand actions. Bhagavan said that this world is created by me and it is regulated by Dharma. It is regulated by the laws of nature that we know. The laws of nature have no exceptions and therefore they're self regulated. Nobody has to vouch over law of gravitation.\n\nNobody vouch over the laws of thermodynamics. And you can rely on them. Only time the people deviate from the Dharma is when they have free will. The human beings are the only one who have free will. So when they deviate from that Dharma, Bhagavan said, I manifest to make that Dharma aligned again. So we can say at the micro level, when I will deviate from my Dharma, the situation will teach me to come back to my Dharma.\n\nYou learn a lesson by your own actions, by your own situations. And then as long as there are good thoughts, as we have seen, it says Paritranaya Sadhunam Vinasaacha Duskrita. At the macro level, you can say the whole human society in micro level, when there are good thoughts, are overwhelmed by the bad thoughts in my mind. But one thing, as long as you hang on to the good thoughts, I will manifest in your mind and take care of all the bad thoughts so that the good thoughts will thrive and then you will be able to do what is right for you. Well, then the question obviously occurred: why can't everyone understand what is right and wrong? Bhagavan said, because in this world it is easier for us to find the results of our actions, so we pursue our senses and pursue the deities of our senses.\n\nIn other words, we try to get success out of our actions. And that's miserable and enjoyable. I can see that I have done something and I got these results. So then we get more and more attached to those actions. That's where the problem starts. So the whole chapter is all about how to detach yourself from your own actions.\n\nTherefore he said that this yoga I have taught to Vivaswan. And then he taught to Manu and the Manu taught to Eswaku. And thus all those Rajasis knew what is right, how to act in this world. So you are liberated. So you're not bound by your actions. But over a period of time that is lost.\n\nSo people are all got then attached to the actions. Everybody is trying to put more importance in what I have accomplished and achieved. And that's how you are judged by the society, by yourself. And they say that's what the problem is. So I'm teaching you this yoga which will liberate you from that. And then he said, obviously all people are not made equal.\n\nChatharuvanyam Maya Guna Karma, vi Pagisah that in any given society the people are four types. And as we discussed last time, no matter how hard you try, you will not be able to justify that. Bhagavan meant the four caste system universified. There are not four types of colors, Chatruvand. Four types of people of different colors I have created. So these were about the skin colors.\n\nObviously there are no four types of skin colors in our society. Or you can look at it this way. The colors are associated with Satvaraja and Tamas as white, red and black. And then they have added the yellow as the Vaishya. Then it's one of the commentary I have read says, okay, if that's the case, if it was a skin color, all whites are Brahmins, all red Indians are Kshatriyas, all Mongolis. People who are yellowish are Vaishyas and all dark people are Shudras.\n\nThat's not true either. So these are the colors of your mind. These are the colors of one's mental textures. See, the people in this world come with four different mental textures. And depending on the Guna and karma, they are divided into the four classification. Any given society at any given time that I am the author of them.\n\nIn other words, they exist because of me. But I'm not involved in. I didn't create them. They are by themselves have their own gunas and karmas. So even though I Act, I do not participate in that. As this self, as the supreme Self, there is no creation.\n\nAll exists is himself as one single entity. And therefore what is created is in perception only. So he said, even though I am the author of Jatir Vraniam, I am not the responsible party. And then we have seen that he said the Namaam Karmani limpanti Namay karmafulasproha. Why I am not attached to that? Because I am not Karma Falas proha.\n\nYou only get attached when you have Karma falasproha. From the self's perspective, he does not have anything to gain. So at macro level, the Bhagavan has nothing to achieve and therefore he has no desire. As long as you have no desire, you cannot be bound by it. At a micro level, all the desires are at my intellectual and mental level only myself is not participating in it. As the self, I'm completely detached from my actions.\n\nSo the actions are performed at the body level, are taught as the mind level desired at the intellectual and mental level. So these sufferers are also mind, body and intellect only. My actions are not right physical level, I suffer through physical level. At a mental level, I suffer through mind and suffer through intellect when they are wrong. But the self is not attached. Therefore the Namam Karmani Limpanti self is not affected by any actions, good, bad or ugly.\n\nJust as our analogy of space, the quality of the space inside the room is exactly the same as outside the room. This space, no matter how I try to contaminate it, will not be affected and will not change its characteristics. Because it remains exactly same as the universal space outside. So myself in me is also in the same manner is not getting affected by my actions. Ithima yo Vijayanarti Karma Vihen NASA badhya. The one who knows this then my accents are only binding my body, mind and intellect.\n\nTherefore the enjoyers and sufferers are nothing but the body, mind and intellect. At the ego level only, the self is not participating and not suffering. One who knows that Karma bhi NASA Badhyate actions do not bind them. Many people in the past, your ancestors knew this. And they continue to perform actions as required by their duties and the roles they've taken. But knowing that core of their being is not affected by these actions.\n\nThey lived very successful life and liberated themselves. And therefore I'm now advising you that you should also do this. Because one thing is clear. You cannot live without actions. Action is a signature of life. As long as you're alive, you have to perform actions.\n\nWhen actions stop that's your death. Only in death you will be actionless. Action you must perform. But you need to change the attitude towards action. So you become actionless. You as the core of your being is not participating in these actions.\n\nSo you align yourself with the one which is not participating. Not align one which is fighting this battle. That's how you will become actionless. Goal is to become liberated from actions. One way to liberate from action is to become actionless. If I don't drive, Meena and I always argue you have a lot of traffic tickets.\n\nLook at me, I've only got one or two. Compare the amount of miles I drive and compare the mile you drive. Then put a probability on every hundred thousand miles you drive or 10,000 how many tickets you got and how many tickets I got. So one way to not get a ticket is what? But you can avoid that. Because you can't come from your home to the class without driving.\n\nSo driving is unavoidable. So somehow you have to avoid getting tickets of other means. So action is unavoidable in life. So getting bound by the action is also unavoidable. But there may be other means to not getting attached is not identifying with the one who is acting. Then when you disown your relative who is doing something bad, you are no more attached to the actions.\n\nAs long as you are relating to that. I am part of that organization which is doing something wrong. You are bound by that. You detach yourself from that. You are just a witness now. So there must be another way of detaching ourselves from actions.\n\nOur Sastra says there is a way. The concept Saksi Chaitanya. Just as when I am watching other people witnessing what other people are doing, I am not getting affected. Because I am just witness. You are doing some two people are fighting. I cannot be blamed for that fight the same.\n\nIf I start seeing my actions as a third party then I will not be bound by my actions. It's called Saksichaitanya. So the next verse says Kim Karma Kim Akarma IDHI kavayo ABHI atramo hita ha. And as Swami explains, even in our day to day life we call Kavi a poet as a Kavi in our vernacular languages. But Kavi with the name of a Rishi was a great Rishi who has written so many of these. You know Richas in Vedas.\n\nSo after that, even the other Rishis, other people who were wise, were also called Kavis. The word Kavi became a connotation for a very wise person. A wise person is supposed to know what is right and what is wrong. But he says karmas are so complex that even wise people do not know what is action and what is inaction. They get confused, deluded by that.\n\nSee, in this world, if we look at the relationship of cause and effect, everything in our universe works on cause and effect. So this universe is a very predictable universe.\n\nThere is nothing in this universe which cannot be predicted as long as you know all the factors which are acting on that action. So when you send the Mars, whatever the Yan as long as you calculate all the forces and act on that correctly and perfectly, it will land exactly as you plan. If you don't know one factor which is affecting it, you will not be able to predict where it is going to land. So if you know everything about how the world reacts to actions, you will be able to predict what the results would be. Not very difficult in theory. But it is difficult to know how many things will affect my actions in this world.\n\nI submit a proposal and I think I have done everything I know. So the result should be this. What I don't know is what the other people are doing, what their proposals would be like and therefore I cannot predict. Therefore I shouldn't be worried about what will come out of that. Therefore I said the nature of action in action is so complex because so many factors affect the result. They even get confused when they try to predict what will happen.\n\nTate Karma Pravakshami -- therefore I am going to tell you what Karma is, not what Karma Phala (the fruits of action) will be, but what the nature of action itself is.",
      "reflection": "These verses address one of the most profound puzzles of spiritual life: \"Kim karma kim akarma iti kavayo 'py atra mohitah\" - even the wise are confused about what is action and what is inaction. Krishna promises to explain this mysterious subject, for understanding it liberates one from all evil. The teaching culminates in verse 18: one who sees inaction in action and action in inaction is the wisest among people, a true yogi who has accomplished all actions (kritsnakarmakrit).\n\nWhat does it mean to see inaction in action? When you become so skilled at something that your mind and intellect are no longer effortfully engaged, the action becomes automatic - like driving a car after years of practice. The deeper teaching is that the Self is always inactive; only the body, mind, and intellect act. Conversely, apparent inaction can be the most powerful action - like a supervisor whose mere presence makes workers productive, or a political leader whose decision not to act shapes history. By not acting, you are still doing something with consequences.\n\nToday, observe your actions throughout the day. Notice which activities engage your full mental effort and which flow naturally without strain. When driving, walking, or doing routine tasks, recognize that \"you\" (the witnessing Self) are not truly acting - it is the conditioned body-mind operating. Also notice where you are not acting - and what effect that inaction is having. Are there good intentions being overwhelmed by neglect? The wise person understands that the nature of action is gahana - deep and mysterious. Results depend on countless factors beyond your knowledge or control. Focus on performing right action with the understanding that the Self is always the non-participant witness (sakshi chaitanya), and you will find freedom even while engaged in intense activity."

      "commentary": "What is my purpose and destiny? So we had been discussing chapter four, Gnana Karma Sannyasa Yoga -- Yoga of renouncing actions in knowledge. Not physically renouncing actions, but renouncing attachment to them through knowledge. How to not identify with your actions. So far we have seen that Bhagavan said Ajaha -- I am Ajaha, I'm unborn.\n\nTherefore he is also Amara. Therefore he is deathless. One who has no birth cannot have any death. So because he is Ajaha, he is also Amara. And not only that, but he says, I am a Karmaha, I am actionless, I am birthless, I am deathless, also actionless. So at the macro level he says, I'm not participating in anything that you consider is happening.\n\nIt is only happening because of my presence. But I am not actively participating in it because I don't have any desire to get anything out of it. There is no desire for Karma Phala of these actions, therefore I am not involved in it. Even the action is taking place because of his presence. But because he is not involved in it, with any desire to gain anything out of it, he is actionless. Same thing applies at a micro level to our self, which we constantly call it I that I am, I am.\n\nBut then everything we say after that I am, that I is not involved in it. I am working, I am speaking. So all the words which we attach to I and am that existence, I is not involved in it. So Bhagwan says, who is involved in that action? Then the one who consider that to be the actor is involved in it. That I, when I say I am eating, that's a physical act, so the body is involved.\n\nThen when I say I like what I eat, my mind is involved. And then my intellect says, this is pretty nutritious, so I'm going to get some benefit out of it. My intellect is involved. Whatever gets involved, that's the one which is bound by its results. So once the I is not involved as the actor and therefore remains Actionless. That which gets involved will be bound by the actions and therefore has to receive the results.\n\nSo my body is involved in my physical act. So more exercise I do or less exercise I do, more I eat or less I eat will show up in my body. When I go to my doctor, he figures out that you may not have been doing this or you may not be watching your diet. Because my lab results tell him exactly. All that tells him what I had been doing. So the body is bound by its own actions.\n\nWhatever the grudges and complexes I carry, they will show up in my mental attitude. So the mind is bound by what mind does. Then what I learn or not learn will show up at my intellectual level. So this body, mind and intellect are bound by these actions. Till I get attached to that body, mind and intellect, I am not involved and actionless. But as soon as I identify with this body, mind and intellect, I become the doer.\n\nAnd that doer is, aham, the ego. Once the ego is formed, that ego becomes the enjoyer and sufferer of these actions. So now who are we trying to really liberate right now? Not the body, not the mind, not the intellect. Ego is the sufferer and enjoyer. That ego is trying very hard to redeem itself.\n\nAchieving a state where there is no unhappiness, there is no sorrow and there is no death. So that ego is trying very hard to achieve that by actions. Because it can only attach itself to the body, mind and intellect. And therefore it says, let me achieve this. I can achieve security by accomplishing things and acquiring things. Or I can achieve deathlessness by finding all the latest cures about or anti aging drugs, whatever that is.\n\nAnd it's failing miserably. No matter how hard I try, I think I'm not aging. But other people say, Neil, you look little old now. My nephews and nieces. Kaka, now you look a little tired. And what do you mean?\n\nWe are trying very hard to achieve what we are trying to achieve through the means available to us right now. But we are not getting there. So Bhagavan said, the only one way to achieve is you disassociate yourself from actions. But actions cannot stop. So say that you have to achieve that knowledge where you start seeing inaction in actions. Actions are being performed.\n\nThe only entity which is inactive in this is my self. My self is not taking any part; my consciousness, just because it is there, makes all three function -- the body, mind and intellect. Swamiji uses the example that a supervisor really doesn't do anything. On a factory floor, the supervisor is not operating machines, but his presence makes all the work go on. If he's not there, work will be all over the place.\n\nI give my real life example a lot of times. I used to work in India in an architect's firm, and my boss used to come to the United States every two years or so to renew his green card. During those four to six weeks he was here, we would have a complete vacation. We all go to work every morning just as when he was there. We try very hard to work for about half an hour. And then somebody will say, \"You know, Neil, did you know this?\"\n\nAnd he will start a topic and then everybody get involved. We have about six, seven people in the same room. That topic will go on till lunchtime. Then we realize, oh God, we haven't done anything. Well, let's have lunch. And then after that we can work something.\n\nAnd that will go on till about four weeks. And when we realize that one week my boss is going to come back, we start suddenly putting something on a paper which looks like we had done some work. In the end, there was no real work done when he was not there. And as soon as he comes, everything goes back to normal. We are working, just as the supervisor's presence makes all the workers work. But the supervisor really doesn't do the work himself.\n\nHe doesn't sit down and start doing what he was supposed to do. His presence make it work. But he is not participating in your activities the same way the self is not participating, but the very presence of the self, the consciousness make people work. But because right now my identification is with the workers, all the drawbacks and the quality of the workers become my qualities. But if I identify with that self who is actionless, then I'll see myself as actionless too. Karmani Akarma Yahya Pashet -- one who sees inaction.\n\nAction only takes place when my ego gets involved. When I was in Zambia, it was so difficult to get a driver's license because the test was about 20 times more difficult than what you go through here. And without a driver's license you can't do anything. So you are so keen on getting a driver's license, you work so hard, and your mind and intellect are both involved in driving so intensely. Last week I told somebody, \"You know, I'm trying very hard to remember everybody's name.\"\n\nAnd she said, don't try too hard. That was the problem -- I was putting too much mental effort into it. So when I'm trying too hard to drive the car, it's very difficult. But now when I drive, I don't consider that as a real action requiring effort because my mind and intellect are not intensely involved while I'm driving -- it has become automatic. So Bhagavan said, when you do that, you reach a level where all your actions you see just as what you see, you're driving, you are literally removed. You have your mind and intellect are free to think about other things. Karmaniya, Karmaiya, Pashet, Karmani, Chakarma Yaha.\n\nNot only that, but even though it seems inaction, but action is taking place. By not acting also you are doing something which is affecting you. Sabuddhiman, Manusheshu. Out of all these people who consider themselves intellectuals, such a person is a wise one. Sabuddhima and Manish Yeshu, he is a Buddhiman. He is a true intelligent person who figured out that actions are taking place at the level of body, mind and intelligence, not at my self level.\n\nSahayuktaha, Such a person is Yogi. He is connected Yogi, one who is connected with the self. As we have seen at a macro level, the supreme self, the God is everywhere, is omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent. At micro level, myself is omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent. In my this body, mind and intellect. When I see that is myself, I'm connected with that self.\n\nSo Sai Yuktah, Krishna Karmakrit and such a person knows how to act. In this world we are all acting but at a very lesser capacity. I think they say you are only using the 1/10 of the capacity of your brain. Our brain has so much capacity, but we are only using it at a very micro level. Bhagwan said, if you then think about how capable you are when you connect to your higher self, then when you act, your actions will be perfect. Krishna, Karma, Krita, Such a person know how to perform real actions.\n\nIt actually says how to become efficient in life by connecting with your higher self. And then the next few verses actually give the prescription for how to connect to that higher self. So now we have learned what the issue is. The issue is that I consider myself to be a mortal being who has birth, who is acting in this world and suffering. Bhagavan said, no, no, you're birthless, you're deathless and you have all the capacity to work in this world -- you just have a wrong identification. So yes, we hear this word Samaram in our vernacular language.\n\nWhen there is some event taking place -- Samaram. For whom are all events taking place in his life? Kama Sankalpa Varjita -- there should be Kama Sankalpa Varjita. Kama means desire. Sankalpa is translated here as planning; I would say determination. What are we determining?\n\nI want to do this and I want to get out of this. So first I have a desire. I want to make million dollar, then make a plan. How am I going to make a million dollar? That plan is based on what I'll get a million dollar out of it. So all my actions are first starts with the desire, then I have a plan to achieve that particular results out of that action.\n\nAnd therefore I'm bound to fail. Because first of all I have not figured out whether what I desire is really appropriate for my capability. And secondly, whether the plan I'm putting together action I'm putting together or capable of achieving it. Because only thing available to me as I said in this world is knowledge of my actions. I do not have knowledge about how the world is going to react to these actions but I'm still determining what the results would be. Therefore there are more unknowns than knowns in my actions. There are more chances of failure than success.\n\nSo: do not have any desire and do not have any plan to get something out of it. Kama Sankalpa Varjita. Gnana Agni Dagda Karmanam -- I am acting in this world, but all my actions are burnt with the fire of knowledge. The knowledge that this body, mind and intellect are limited in their capabilities. But the self which is involved in these actions is only a Sakshi Chaitanya -- a witness -- and he is not affected by any of these actions.",
      "reflection": "These verses describe the qualities of a true sage (pandita): one whose every undertaking is free from desire and selfish planning (kama-sankalpa-varjita), whose actions are burned in the fire of knowledge (jnanagni-dagdha-karmanam). Such a person, though apparently acting, does nothing at all (naiva kinchit karoti sah), because they have surrendered attachment to results and remain ever content and independent (nitya-tripto nirasrayah). The culmination is verse 21: expecting nothing, with controlled mind, abandoning all possessiveness, performing only bodily actions, one incurs no sin (kilbisham).\n\nThe teaching here addresses the fundamental error: we identify with the doer and therefore become bound by results. The ego is the sufferer and enjoyer, not the Self. When we act from desire (kama) and planning for specific outcomes (sankalpa), we plant seeds that must bear fruit. But when actions arise spontaneously from our nature without personal agenda, they leave no karmic residue. It is like the difference between a new employee desperate to impress versus a master craftsman who simply does excellent work because that is who they are.\n\nFor today's practice, before each significant action, pause and ask: What desire is driving this? What outcome am I planning and attached to? Practice \"tyaktva karma-phalasangam\" - releasing attachment to results before you begin. Notice how this changes the quality of your engagement. When you finish an action, practice letting it go like a post-it note that leaves no mark. The sage acts only at the bodily level (shariram kevalam karma) - meaning the deeper Self is uninvolved. Can you act today with your body and skills fully engaged while your inner witness remains detached, content, and free?"

      ],
      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter four, Gnana Karma Sannyasi Yoga. Yoga of Renouncing actions in Knowledge. So far we have seen that actions are necessary, but actions are also binding. My ultimate goal is to get happiness only way I feel happiness. I'm completely liberated from my limitations and here I am acting in this world and actions are binding. So what is the prescription?\n\nWhat is that one yoga which will liberate me from these limitations? So in the beginning Bhagavan said, this is the yoga which I taught from time immemorial to people. And people have been benefited by this by practicing this yoga to release themselves from these bondages. So I'm going to teach you again and see, the technique is very, very simple. You have to end all your actions in knowledge that you are not the actor. It is as simple as that.\n\nRight now we are taking burden upon ourselves of something which does not belong to us, a responsibility which does not belong to me. I'm taking upon myself which is to control the Karmaphala. My constant goal in life is to get the desired results. That's why we plan five year plan, three year plan. People ask me all the time, Neil, what's your plan? I say, what do you mean what's my plan?\n\nI'm talking about retirement. What's your plan for retirement? You have to plan out retirement in a particular manner so that then I can enjoy the retirement. So we plan our actions, keeping the final results in mind, which is Karma Phala. Karma Phala by very nature is not in my hand because I'm not the Karma Falada. The rest of the world is the Karma Falada.\n\nI act and the world react and that burden on me is binding me. Bhagawan said, once you realize that you are not the actor, the one who you think you are. This body, mind and intellect is not the one who you try to satisfy. The one which is seeking happiness is someone other than your body, mind and intellect. One who wants to be liberated is someone other than your body, mind and intellect. So he starts out by giving his identity, say Ajaha, a peace on Abhyatma.\n\nI myself is unborn, deathless, immutable, and also do not take part in any actions. And therefore the karmas don't bind me. The actions which I don't take part in, they cannot bind me. Bhagavan said, at the macrocosm I am the all pervading Brahman who is infinite, unborn, deathless. And at the micro level Atman has the exact same quality. So at the macro level he is Brahmandu, all pervading, Almighty, all potent, omniscient God.\n\nAt a macro level is Myself which I constantly refer. I is nothing but his own Self. We have logically deducted in our discussion that this world cannot be separate from Him. Because when he created this universe, the cosmos, the Brahman, no other material available to him other than his own Self created out of his own Self. And therefore you and I and this world cannot be any separate from Him. But that understanding when it takes place that this room space is no different than the space outside, then all the limitations of the room space will be gone.\n\nSo right now the room space thinks it's limited by its wall, floor and ceiling, and it is suffering from its limitation. \"I want this room to have a higher ceiling.\" These limitations are also nothing but his own manifestation. If God is omnipresent, where is my body, my intellect, my mind? They are also part of Him. There is only one material available to him to create this universe, which is his own self.\n\nSo he created out of his own self. And now I'm trying to liberate his self from these limitations which are also part of his self. It is like a cup which is made up of ice is immersed into water. So the water outside the cup is also water. Water inside the cup is also water. And the cup itself is nothing but water.\n\nBut the crystallization creates identification of name and form and shape. The ego is that crystallization of the shape of a cup. When it melts, it will be all water. So Bhagavan said, once you start realizing that the self you are trying to liberate is already liberated, it is not taking part in any of your actions and therefore it is not bound by it. But you are now identifying this self with this limited body, mind and intellect, with his name, forms and colors. And therefore you are reflecting all its limitations.\n\nSo he said, now you start contemplating on it and then live your life. We have seen that how to live life is Vitaraga Bhayakrodha -- without any attachment, without any particular desired fruits of actions which I had been trying to achieve, which are not in my hand.\n\nAccording to your swadharma. We have learned Swadharma. This body has its own Swadharma. Mind has its own swadharma. Intellect own swadharma. Just go with that flow.\n\nIf I try to make this hall into a concert hall, I'll be disappointed. It does not have any of the qualities of a concert hall. I try to have a music party and then I say I don't sound good here. Because the hall does not have the quality to have the acoustics of a concert hall. As long as I live with the limitations of this room, I'll be happy with this room. As soon as I get out of my expectations of what this hall can do.\n\nI'll be disappointed. Bhagavan said, follow your Svadharma and do actions without any attachment, without any particular expectation of the fruits of actions. So the last verse, the 22nd, describes the state you should be achieving to be perfectly happy.\n\nThe stage which you have to achieve is Yadruchanthusthaha. Content with whatever comes to you without effort. That sounds a little tricky to understand. It does not mean that you didn't put in your efforts. But it means: without conniving and manipulating to control the results, without scheming so that everything will fall in place exactly as you want.\n\nThat's not going to happen. The results are not in your hand, no matter how smart you are. Therefore, you act according to your dharma. Then whatever comes -- without manipulating outcomes -- you accept contentedly. You put your efforts.\n\nYou realize that was according to my efforts. Move on to the next step. Yadruchala va santoshta Dvanda Athitaha. Of course we know that there are times that will be conducive. At time the fruits will be not conducive. I expected something.\n\nI was targeting to achieve this. But I end up getting this. So that's going to happen. That's a given that the law of nature that things will be different every time, same effort. You put two different times, get two different results. Last time I said this and everybody was very excited.\n\nAnd this time I said let's do this. And nobody is excited. So the world will be like that. Therefore, you will be buffeted between hope and dejection. Vimatsaraha without envy. Now this sounds very difficult.\n\nBut it is the only way you can be happy, because as you have seen in our analogies, somebody will always be a little better than me no matter how high I go. I saw on CNBC someplace that the most difficult group of people to plan retirement for is millionaires. It's easier for someone in the hundred thousand range. They can project how many times your current income you need for retirement. It's easy for a guy making $60,000 a year. Guys making $10 million a year -- they're very difficult.\n\nYou see, it's very difficult as you go higher and higher to achieve that perfection. Bill Gates -- if you tell him he needs an income seven times his current income to retire, he will never be able to retire. So Bhagavan said, Vimatsarah: do not judge your situation by comparing with the other person. You do not know his situation. Every time I see Facebook, I get very depressed because everybody else in the world seems so happy.\n\nI'm the only one who has all these responsibilities and problems. Do not compare your situation with others. That's where the envy comes. I stopped reading Fortune and Bloomberg and Newsweek because it depresses me. Vimatsaraha -- Bhagwan said, the only way to be happy is not to compare your situation with others.\n\nSama Siddhava Siddha, we know success and failure. It's a relative term. But you decided what success is and you did what failure is. You remember that whatever really came is what you really deserved. Swamiji used to say, you don't get what you desire, you get what you deserve. Sama Siddha ashidhav krutvapi nani badhyata.\n\nHe never gets bound by any actions he performs, good, bad or ugly. Because once you perform actions you're done with, there's nothing you can do about it. So whatever comes back, you say, okay, next move, let's go to the next one. So you see, that's the state you need to achieve. And it seems very difficult, but it is truly, I'll tell you, it is the only way you will be happy. When you get closer to that state, it may not be exactly as you imagine in your mind what yogi should be.\n\nBut at some level, you have to achieve this to be happy. So next verse says, gatha sangasya muktasya gnana avasthi da cha yajnaya acharataha Karma Samagram Praviliyate. Our goal right from the beginning was not to be bound by my actions. My actions should be always pristine and come with the results which are complete. So I will never have to be reacting to it. So I don't want to be bound by my actions.\n\nSo the first goal we have said is Gata Sangasya. Attachment to your actions. Whose actions will be as perfect as they need to be to achieve the goal which we established in previous verse. One who is not attached to his actions. See, once I'm attached to my actions -- I had an interview, I thought I did the best in my interview.\n\nThen this happens all the time. When we go for an interview, we come back and they select us. How can they select him? I think we were the best team. Give us the feedback. All of them are qualified.\n\nBut what did we not do? You did everything right. But we thought the other day I was a little better than you are a little more appropriate for this project. But we are so attached to our actions. We think that our actions are the most appropriate. Should get the result I am looking for.\n\nBut once I perform action, I should not be attached to Gata Sangasya. We are detached to your actions. Once you perform actions and move on, you are liberated from it. You feel free because you are not thinking about it. Gnana Avasthita Cheta Saha. But this thing only came because I'm established in knowledge.\n\nI have learned over and over and over again. The results are not in my hand. Once that knowledge takes place that no matter how better I do, results will never be in my hand. Same presentation you make one time and you are the best. And next time they will say you are the lowest. Gnana Vastyatchiyata Saha.\n\nHis intellect is established in the knowledge that only control I have is on my own actions and not on the results. Yajnaya Acharataha Karma. Therefore he is acting for only one reason.",
      "reflection": "Verse 22 presents the state we must achieve for perfect happiness: content with what comes without scheming (yadriccha-labha-santushtah), beyond the pairs of opposites (dvandvatitah), free from envy (vimatsarah), balanced in success and failure (samah siddhav asiddhau). Such a person, though acting, is not bound. Verse 23 shows the method: being free from attachment (gata-sangasya), liberated (muktasya), with mind established in knowledge (jnanaavasthita-chetasah), acting only for yajna - such a person's karma completely dissolves (samagram praviliyate).\n\nThe profound verse 24 reveals the ultimate vision: \"Brahmarpanam brahma havir brahmagnau brahmana hutam\" - the offering is Brahman, what is offered is Brahman, the fire is Brahman, the offerer is Brahman. When one sees this unity, even while acting, one remains united with God (brahmaiva tena gantavyam). This is like ice immersed in water - the cup, the water inside, and the water outside are all the same substance. The crystallization creates apparent separation, but upon melting, all is revealed as one.\n\nToday, practice contentment with whatever comes naturally from your efforts, without manipulating results. When comparing yourself to others (a major source of suffering), remember \"vimatsarah\" - you do not know their full situation. What looks like success on social media hides struggles you cannot see. In your actions today, practice the Brahman vision: see the instrument of action (your body), the effort expended, the field of action, and the actor as expressions of one reality. When you fail or succeed, maintain \"samah siddhav asiddhau\" - equal-mindedness. Ask: If I truly believed that everything involved in my action is Brahman, how would I approach this task differently?"

      "commentary": "What is my purpose and destiny? We had been discussing chapter four, Gnana Karma Sannyasa Yoga, Yoga of Enunciation of action in Knowledge. So far we have seen that chapter two defined what Yoga is and then told Arjuna that Yogastha Guru Karmani, you perform actions rooted in Yoga. And then Bhagavan defined what yoga is. Samatam Yoga Uchate, equanimity is Yoga. That was the simple but very powerful definition Bhagavan gives it.\n\nSamatam Yoga Uchate, equanimity of mind is Yoga if your mind is balanced in all situations, whether conducive or unconducive. Bhagwante Dutch Yoga. But then how do I translate that into my daily life? So Bhagavan said Yoga Karmasu Kavushalam, dexterity in your actions is Yoga. If you are performing action without any anxiety, then obviously there will be effective actions. And if this anxiety about the fruits of actions is not there, then your actions will be effective.\n\nBhagavan says that's the sign of you being establishing Yoga. Bhagawan dedicated chapter three for defining Karma Yoga. So we have seen in chapter three what Karma Yoga is. Karmas are binding because they are bound by the law of causation. It is bound by the law of cause and effect that if I perform an action that will be the cause and there will be effect which is a reaction from the world and I'll be bound by their reaction. How to mitigate that causation is Karma Yoga.\n\nSo chapter three Bhagavan dedicated to define what Karma Yoga is. And in a simple term in verse nine, he said Yajnarthaat Karmano Anyatra Loko Ayam Karma Bandanah. Any action which is not performed for Yajna is binding in this world. So the simple definition of Karma Yoga is when I perform action for Yajna, then it is Karma Yoga. And we have then defined Yajna. Yajna is any action which is performed for the greater good is Yajna, any action which is performed for my selfish gain.\n\nIs binding action, Karma. Any action which is performed for the greater good is Yajna. Yajna, Loko, Ayam, Karma, Bandanah. Any action which is performed for the selfish motives, if I am at the center of the result, it is for me that's a selfish motive. And therefore Bhagavan said, you're bound by that action. Whatever the reaction comes from the world of your action, you're bound by that.\n\nYou have to enjoy it or suffer it. But if it is performed with a greater good, then you are not bound by it. You perform action and your story ends there. Whatever results come out, the world will suffer or enjoy. So we have defined Karma Yoga in chapter three. Chapter four is now centered on the word Yajna.\n\nSo in chapter three, we have learned what Karma Yoga is, is to perform actions in the spirit of Yajna. But what yajna is is now defined in chapter four. And then chapter five will take that a step further. And what sannyasa is, this chapter is labeled Renunciation of Action in Knowledge. So I'm now renouncing my actions and not mine by thorough understanding that I'm not the doer. In other words, I'm not capable of doing anything unless I'm enabled by all others.\n\nAll others in this world have to do so many things for me to do even the smallest act of drinking tea. When I come to understand that I am not the sole one in charge of my action, then my ego will diminish. And then I come to understand that the ego actually has no real part in the consciousness which is enabling it to perform action. So Bhagavan said, that is how I renounce my action in knowledge. When I renounce my actions completely, I become a sannyasi. When I have no sense of agency, I am a sannyasi.\n\nSo this concept of Karma Yoga is defined in three chapters. First, define Karma Yoga. And then we will learn what is Sannyasa. So far in chapter four, we have learned what is action, what is inaction. One who sees inaction in action and action in inaction. He's the person who sees things as they are.\n\nThere are times when I'm acting, but it's of no consequence. And there are times I'm not acting, but there are great consequences of my not acting. That itself is a great action. We have seen last time that Mitch McConnell not bringing legislation to the floor is inaction. But it's the greatest action he performs -- by not doing anything. Similarly, there are times we don't do anything.\n\nIf we don't perform our duty, it's an inaction. But that's a great action performed by us which will have the consequences. So you'll learn what is inaction? The one who sees through inaction and action. He knows what actions are. And then we have seen the characteristics of a sage.\n\nWe have seen similar Characteristics in Chapter 2 in Sthita Prajna Lakshana. The last section of Chapter 2 define what a man of perfect wisdom is. So the last verse we have seen. Yadruchalabhasantustaha Dhwandvati Taha Matsyara Sama Siddha asiddhavcha Krustva nani badyate. Who does not get bound by the action? A man of perfect wisdom.\n\nWhat is perfect wisdom? What is action and what is inaction? One who has learned this art of action. Such a person is from our perspective. He is acting feverishly. Swami Chinmayananda was the most dynamic person I knew.\n\nHe was acting all the time. But none of his actions ever bound him. Because Sama Siddhi Asiddhavcha same in success and failure. You take a project and you have great goals. Sometimes you succeed and sometimes you don't. But if you don't take the success and failure to your heart then you are a yogi.\n\nBut therefore those actions do not bind you. He is happy with whatever comes naturally. I perform my actions. What comes to me, I accept as Prasad. I do not question why me and why not me. I am not getting result.\n\nOther people are not doing anything but getting all the credits. But once a one who does not think in those terms, he is happy. Yadrucha Lava Santustha. He gets whatever without any anxiety. He is happy with that Dvandvati Tah. He is beyond the pairs of opposites.\n\nIn other words, he is not affected by the pairs of opposites. Pairs of opposites are very much in this world. There are days which are cold and there are days which will be very hot. But if I know how to deal with both of them then I am a happy person. How do I compare myself whether I am successful or not? By comparing myself to others.\n\nIf I see others are not as successful as I am then I consider myself successful. But I think I am not as successful others. Then I consider myself a failure. That's how we judge ourselves. Our gauge is not inside. Our gauge is outside.\n\nI don't judge by my own height, I judge by other side. Other people are taller than me, therefore I'm short. Other people are shorter than me then I'm tall. When we change who I am Bhagawan said V Matsyara There is no envy. Everybody is who that person is. Such a person Sama Siddha, Siddhav, Krustvapin Nani Badyate he does not get bound.\n\nSo we have seen the definition of perfect person in the verse 23 really ties all that together in half a line. What a person of perfect wisdom is Gatha Sanghasya whose attachment is gone devoid of attachment that the first quality of a sage that he has no attachment to anything. He lives in the present environment, in India, in Egypt, in Iran Wherever I find myself, I find myself comfortable. Bhagawan says that's because no attachment. Gatha Sanghas is devoid of attachment in any situation. If I feel comfortable, that means the word of attachment Muktasya this liberation only comes if I have no attachment.\n\nOne with no attachment is always free. We are bound by our own attachments. The bondage which I feel in this world is my own creation. I myself decided that I am a tattoo. My family, my children, my profession, my possessions I'm bound by them. I feel myself incomplete without them.\n\nI have bound myself and only I have the capability to liberate myself. When I liberate myself from these attachments, I avoid these attachments. Muktasya he becomes Mukta liberated. But this is only possible if Gnana Avasthita Cheta Saha whose mind, whose Chetana whose Chitta is established in knowledge Knowledge about who I am and who I am not. If I know my true self that I am not this body, mind and intellect, the limited being, this body and intellect are my equipment. But I am something other than this.\n\nAll the attachments of the body, all the likes and dislikes of the body, of the mind, of the intellect belong to them only and not to me the self. Such a person will be devoid of attachment. Because he is devoid of attachment he will be liberated. So what is important is the knowledge. Knowledge about your own self. So I may get this glimpse of my true self in meditation.\n\nBut it's not going to last forever. I'll come back to my day to day life and have to work in this world. River Bhagawan said Yajna Acharatah Karma Samagram Praviliyate Then I'll still be working in this world. But for Yajna Going back to the verse in chapter three, Yajna tat Karmanu annytra lokoyam Karmabandana. Now that I have no attachment, I will be working, but only for the Yajna for the purpose of helping the community, helping the society, helping everyone around me. All his Karma will be dissolved.\n\nIn other words, there is no after effect, there is no rebound effect, there is no cause and effect relationship to his actions. He is not performing for himself. The next verse defines what Yajna is. Brahmarpanam Brahmahavehi Brahmagna Brahmanahutam Brahma Eva Tena Gantavyam Brahma Karma Samadhinaha we have seen that everything in this world, if it is manifestation of the same entity, the Brahman, then obviously you and I cannot be any different from Brahman himself itself, herself. Brahman is the reality. Everything else is just a projection on the Brahman.\n\nI cannot be different from my own Lord. Because if God created this universe out of his own self, there is nothing in the universe which is other than Bhagavan God Ishwara Brahman. Therefore he says any action that liberated sage of perfect wisdom performed, he sees that it's happening in the Brahman by the Brahman, in the self, by the self. Very famous metaphor of Yajna used here to explain Yajna. In the Vedic time the Yajna was very central ritual. So in that central ritual you, you have fire invoked.\n\nA deity is invoked and something is offered to the deity through that fire in the fire by the devotee. So Brahma Arpanam, Brahman is the instrument of offering the ladle which is used in the Yajna to pour the ghee, the ladle itself in nothing but Brahman alone. It is the manifestation of the same reality. So Brahma Arpanam, the means to act is Brahman. In my case, the means to act is my body, my organs of actions. They are nothing but the manifestation or the representation of Brahman only Brahma Havihi.\n\nWhat I am offering in that fire, what I am offering is my efforts performing actions that's only enabled by Brahman only. So Brahma Havi, the instrument is Brahman. What is offered is also Brahman. Brahma Agna in the fire of Brahman. So in my case the body which enables me to act in this world is expression of Brahman. My efforts to act in this world is also Brahman.\n\nThe field of action in which I am putting my efforts is also Brahman. All is Brahman.",
      "reflection": "These verses introduce various forms of yajna (sacrifice) that yogis practice. Some worship the devas (divine powers), offering sense objects to the senses while remaining detached witnesses. Others perform Brahma Yajna, offering the limited self into the fire of the higher Self. Verse 26 describes sense-control yajna - either restraining the senses from their objects, or restraining the mind from being affected by sensory input. Verse 27 speaks of offering all sense activities and vital energies in the fire of self-restraint, kindled by wisdom (jnana-dipite).\n\nThe teaching builds on what Chapter 3 established: \"Yajnarthat karmano anyatra loko yam karma-bandanah\" - any action not performed for yajna is binding. The purpose of all these yajnas is antahkarana shuddhi - purification of the inner instrument (mind and intellect). We cannot directly control our spiritual awakening, but we can prepare the vessel. As the teaching says, one who is devoid of attachment is always free (gata-sangasya muktasya), and such a person sees all beings as residing within their own Self.\n\nFor daily practice, choose one form of yajna to focus on today. For Deva Yajna: practice witnessing your sense experiences without getting involved - let the world offer itself to your senses without you grasping. For Brahma Yajna: before acting, remember that your limited self is an expression of the unlimited Self, and offer your effort to that higher reality. For sense-control yajna: pick one sense (perhaps sight or taste) and practice restraint - not harsh suppression, but mindful non-attachment. Notice throughout the day: are you the one going to experiences, or are experiences coming to you? The sage sees the world offering itself to the senses while they remain the uninvolved witness."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter four, Gnana Karma Sannyasiyog Yoga of Renunciation of Action in Knowledge. So we had been discussing Karma Yoga in last chapter and in chapter two, Bhagavan says the Karmani Eva Adhi ka Rasthi Mafula that your right is only to act, but you have no right for your fruits of actions. So for us to understand that concept, we have to understand what action is. So we have learnt in this chapter what action is, which then relates to what we learned about Karma Yoga. In the last chapter where we have seen that Bhagavan said Yogastha Kuro Karmani Sangam tyaktvadhananjaya. That's the essence of Karma Yoga.\n\nDo not expect any fruits of your action. Establish yourself in yoga and then without any attachment perform actions in this world is Karma Yoga action I must perform, but I must perform in this manner and for what I should perform action. This chapter in verse nine says Yajnar Tat Karmano anyatra Loko Yam Karma Bandanaha. All actions other than those performed for Yajna are binding Tadartam Karma Kanthya. Therefore, perform actions for Yajna alone, Mukta Sangha Samacharaha without any attachment, with equanimity of mind. So the final advice we have seen is perform actions for Yajna.\n\nWe learnt in verse 24 then that Yajna is to understand that everything that is involved in my action is nothing but Brahman alone. There is no difference between the hunter and hunted. It's all manifestation of Brahman alone. Say Brahmarpanam Brahma have Brahma Agna Brahma hutam. Using this metaphor of Yajna, we have learned that everything involved in this Yajna, the four things involved the instrument, the offerer, the deity and the offering itself. So these four items Bhagavan said, that is nothing but Brahman alone Brahma Eva Samadhi Nah, it's only going to the Brahman alone.\n\nThis is the renunciation of action, in knowledge. Having this knowledge that all actions are performed because in and by Brahman, by the power of Brahman, Bhagawan said that's Yajna. So then next few verses we learn the 12 types of yajnas we have seen so far 10 of them from verse 25 onward. So in verse 25 we say deva Yajna and Brahma Yajna. Deva Yajna is that when I see that all that is happening in my experience all the sense perceptions are only happening. The offerings of the sense object to the senses, the devas.\n\nTherefore I remain detached from those experiences. Every experience I see is only happening between the sense objects and the senses. I am just a witness of what's happening that Deva Yajna. Then we say Brahm Yajna. When I offer my limited self to my higher self. When I realized that my limited self is nothing but the expression of the higher self, it was never separated from its higher self.\n\nAs we have seen, the room space and outer space is always one and the same. Remove the room space remains where it is. My conditioned self remained where it is after my death. It was here before my birth. So that's Brahm Yajna. That understanding firm in your mind, constantly keeping at the back of your mind in all your action.\n\nThen sense control, that's another type of Yajna. Either control your senses so that they don't wander around or mind control. Senses may bring any information but mind does not get attached to it. That's the mind control. Self restraint by controlling all the senses it's self restraint. So that's another Yajna we have seen.\n\nAnd in the last verse which we have discussed there are five Yajnas we have seen. Dravya, Yajna, Tapa Yajna Yoga Yajna, Swadhya Yajna and Jnana Yajna. So the life of charity. Everything that I have is for charity. Dravyajna is not just giving you one check every year during tax time. But it is something which I offer that everything I have is for the greater good.\n\nNothing belongs to me. What I have acquired from this world, this Prakriti, I have to give it back to the Prakriti. What I have borrowed from this Prakriti, this body, mind and intellect, they also don't belong to me. They are just lended to Me for my experiences, that type of attitude, Dravya Yajna then Tapa Yajna austerities for the self control. When I perform certain disciplines, that's tapa Yajna then yoga Yajna, various upasanas and sadhanas. All these Yajnas are for the purification of my mind and intellect for the Antakarana Shuddhi.\n\nAs a seeker of happiness, my job is only to purify my internal instrument. Rest will happen automatically by God's grace. The Bhagavan is partial to his Bhakta. Oh now he's praising me all the time. It is the very nature of yourself. Just like I think that Yogi Berahur said the the more I practice, the luckier I get.\n\nMy preparation made me worthy of getting that opportunity. So here yoga is the upasana I prepare myself. Then the next one is swadhyaya. Reflecting on your own self introspection. Who I am is this body me, this mind me, the intellect me, the accomplishments me. That's basically is the swadhya Yajna.\n\nAnd then we said Gnana Yajna, Yoga of knowledge, offering your ignorance, consciously trying to get out of the veiling of this mind is Gnani Yajna. Our learning Bhagavad Gita falls into the Gnani Yajna. The last two yajnas, the Pranayama and Pratyahara. These come from Patanjali's Yoga sutra, Ashtanga Yoga, eight parts, the Yama Niyama Asana, Pranayama Pratyaha, fourth and fifth steps of Ashtang Yoga, Pranayama Pratyah. So verse 29 says Apane Jhuvati Pranam Pranay Apanam Tatha Apare Prana Apana Gati Ruddhwa Pranayama Prayanaha. Those who are expert, they are engaged in pranayama.\n\nThey perform this pranayama in various ways. There is not one method; there are various ways. It says Apane Jhuvati Pranam. So Apana is the outgoing breath -- and even this book says outgoing breath.\n\nI read Bhagavan Sankaracharya's Bhashya and it says Apana is the incoming breath, which contradicts some other sources. I checked some other books and some agreed with Sankaracharya's Bhashya: Apana is incoming breath (Ap-Anaha is incoming) and Pra-Anaha is outgoing. But whichever interpretation you follow, the essential meaning of the verse does not change -- it's about controlling the breath. Let's say Apane Jhuvati Pranam -- some offer outgoing breath into the incoming breath, and Prana Apanam Tadapara -- some offer the incoming breath into the outgoing breath.\n\nIn other words, two diametrically opposite practices in pranayama. Pranayama, as we have seen, is the control of all the vital energies. But at the core of it is the control of breath, which is actually the word Svasa. If you read Patanjali's Yoga Sutra, he does not use the word Prana here. He says Svasa (incoming) and Prasvasa (outgoing). But the overall technique is also called Pranayama.\n\nBy controlling your breath, you control your pranas. All the other functions of the pranas which right now I have no control over. So even when I am in a deep sleep, all my organs are functioning properly. My heart, my brain, my liver, my kidneys. Because the conscious mind has no control over this organ. You can imagine if the conscious mind has to control these organs, then we will all be in lots of trouble.\n\nBut conscious mind has no control over these organs or they are free of conscious mind. And therefore it functions all three states of my existence. That waking, dream and deep sleep. But the yogis have found ways to control these functions by the conscious mind. This is called pranayama. Their observation was that as the state of my mind change, my breathing changes.\n\nSo if I can control my breathing, I may be able to control all my pranas and all my mental thoughts. So the techniques devised was to control breath. Panditji used to say that we have finite number of breaths to take in this life. If you take faster breathing, you have a shorter life. If you have slower breathing, then you have a longer life. So people who are calm, normally quiet, and have control over their breathing -- they live longer lives. People who are very excitable and constantly get agitated and excited, their breathing goes faster and they live shorter lives. I have no knowledge about that. But this is what the Yoga Sutra basically says: control your breath so that you are regulating your breath.\n\nMany, many years ago when we were in Dallas, Texas, we took a course in Pranayama and Raja Yoga. One of my friend's father, Mr. Haris Raja, was a disciple of Swami Muktananda, and he gave us pranayama training.\n\nWe used to have that in early morning at 6:00. And that's a part of Raja Yoga. So the yogas which we have seen, the pranayama, are performed in three different types of tradition. One is the Shiva Yoga. Vignana Bhairav is the book from the Kashmir Saivites. And you see on TV this Shiva yogicant and he said that by controlling the breath, you can control all your systems.\n\nThere is no need for any medication. We can control everything by controlling breathing. Then, popularly, what we know about yoga in this country is Hatha Yoga. Hatha Yoga is basically the first three sections of Ashtanga Yoga: Yama, Niyama and Asana. We focus more on the third step, which is Asana. But the Yoga Sutra says you should not start Pranayama until you have mastered Asanas.\n\nSo Asanas are very important, and once you master the Asanas, then you do Pranayama. Many teachers I have come across say Hatha Yoga is very good, but it can also be dangerous if you are not under the guidance of a trained teacher. Be careful, have a good teacher, then you can practice. Raja Yoga, on the other hand, is considered safer and subtler. What Pandit Ji used to teach is also Raja Yoga.\n\nAnd what we learned many, many years ago, that's also Raja Yoga where basically the breathing is controlled by nine mudras. They call it remote controls. Now obviously there is no scientific study done on why that works or does it work. But all the yogis have said that they do work. So it's a apana jhuvati panam prana apanam tatha apare prana apana gatirandhwa pranayama prayanaha. Those who are expert, they engage in this pranayama.\n\nAnd in Bhagavan Sankaracharya's Bhashya, I learned that the first technique of apane jhuvati pranam is called purak. We often talk about purak, Rechak and Kumbhak. Sankaracharya said these three are described here. The first one is called purak -- when you are offering incoming breath into the outgoing. Then another is called rechak -- offering outgoing breath into incoming breath.\n\nAnd then pranapana gati ruddhva -- restricting the flow of air is called kumbhak. This has to be practiced in a serial manner. So Mr. Raja used to write articles in Times of India. Those articles were published into a book. In that he said that the goal of pranayama is our normal breathing is about 16 breaths in a minute.\n\nThe goal is to reduce them to four. So in one minute there are only four breaths. He recommends in his book -- and what he taught us back in the '80s -- 5 seconds for inhalation, then 2 seconds of inner Kumbhak (retention), then 7 seconds of exhalation. Because, he said, the air has expanded due to body temperature, so it takes longer to exhale than inhale. That makes 14 seconds.\n\nThen you hold the breath for one second outside before taking the next breath, and you start the cycle again. That makes 15 seconds. So there are four breaths in a minute.",
      "reflection": "These verses enumerate additional forms of yajna: Dravya Yajna (offering wealth/possessions), Tapo Yajna (austerities for self-control), Yoga Yajna (various spiritual practices and upasanas), Swadhyaya Yajna (self-study and introspection), and Jnana Yajna (the sacrifice of ignorance through knowledge). Verses 29-30 describe Pranayama - the control of vital energies through breath regulation - and Pratyahara - control of diet and withdrawal of senses. All these practitioners understand the principle of yajna, and through it their impurities are washed away (yajna-kshapita-kalmashah).\n\nThe teaching emphasizes that there is no single path that fits everyone. Human beings come in various combinations of sattva, rajas, and tamas, so numerous methods exist - \"scattered at the mouth of Brahman\" as Krishna says later. Dravya Yajna is not merely writing an annual charity check but cultivating the attitude that nothing truly belongs to you. What you borrowed from Prakriti must return to Prakriti. The discussion of Pranayama (control of breath) shows how controlling the subtle can affect the gross - by regulating breath, one can influence all pranas and mental states.\n\nFor today's practice, honestly assess which yajna suits your current temperament. If you are naturally generous, practice Dravya Yajna with awareness. If you are disciplined, try Tapo Yajna. If intellectual, focus on Swadhyaya and Jnana Yajna. If you have time, practice simple pranayama: try breathing with a rhythm of 5 seconds inhalation, 2 seconds retention, 7 seconds exhalation, 1 second pause before the next breath - this slows breathing to about 4 breaths per minute, calming the mind. Whatever practice you choose, remember the purpose: purification of the inner instrument so that knowledge may dawn. The method matters less than sincere, sustained effort aligned with your nature."

      "commentary": " Shri Purohit Swami did not comment on this sloka\n\nWe had been discussing chapter four, Gnana Karma Sanyasa Yoga for renouncing actions in knowledge. So far we have seen that Bhagavan said that I am going to tell you a secret knowledge, having known which you will not have to know anything else. And this is nothing new. I had been teaching this from the beginning of time how to end your actions. That's the goal, to end my actions. But right now I'm not finding any means to end these actions.\n\nBhagavan said that one who develops the knowledge that the self is not the doer can get out of this cycle of actions and reactions. The cycle continues: I act, the world reacts, that becomes actions for the world. When I react to that reaction, it becomes my actions, and the action-reaction cycle continues. He said, once you get out of this notion that I am the doer, you will be out of this cycle of doing and reacting, suffering and enjoying.\n\nSo in verse 14 he says namaam karmani lin panthi Namay karmafulesh prahaha ithimam yo vijayanathi karma bihin NASA badhyadhya. He is not bound by any actions. One who knows me as Namam Karmani limpanti Karmas do not bind me, they do not attach to me. I don't get attached to the karma in Namay Karmafula. I do not have any desire for the Karma Phala that I is the self in me. I think I have all these desires.\n\nWell, that I does not have any desires. My mind has desires, my intellect has desires, and also my body has desires. It feels a little hot. My body tells me, let's make it comfortable. So all these things which I think I have karma falas pruha or the desire to enjoy is at either the body level, at the mind level or the intellect level. At the self level there is no desire.\n\nThe one who knows himself as the one has no attachment to action. Self never gets attached to any action. Neither that self has any karma falas pruha. One who knows this as his own self in this manner he does not get bound by any actions. Another question is how do we get to that point? So in verse 23rd, the technique is Gatha Sangasya.\n\nHe has given up all attachments. He works in this world but does not get attached. He said the attachment to the world is like a post it notes. As long as it is there, it is attached, you remove it. It does not leave any mark on their wall. Gatha Sangha says no attachment.\n\nYou can take it from here and put it here. And take it from here, put it here. It will get attached to whatever but not leave any mark. Gnana Vasthidha Saha. So he's free, he's not attached. And his intellect is organized by the knowledge that the self is not having desire for any fruits of actions, neither it is taking part in any actions.\n\nYajnaya Charathaha Karmaha. And therefore he is constantly acting in the spirit of Yajna for the greater good. All the actions which are taking place are only taking place for the greater good, not just for my selfish desires. Karma sama Grim pravely. That's how all the karmas will get destroyed for that person. He's not having any sense of identity with his actions.\n\nThen we have seen that this Yajna can be performed in various ways. But what should be the Yogi, the one who has mastered this art of performing actions in Yajna, his attitude. There are two ways he said. The first one he says is Devam Evapare, Yajnam Yogi, Nahapariupa Sataya. Some yogis will perform all their actions working in this world, experiencing this world as the world is offering its objects for the perception of his senses. World's offering to the senses.\n\nIt's not him going to the world, world coming to him. That's how he never gets attached to him. Because he is not really going out to the world. World is coming to him for his perception. So all the perception comes and goes, but he never gets attached to any one of them. That's the one way other.\n\nBrahma Agnavare Yagnam Yagne Eva Upa Jihuvati. Others will sacrifice the self by the self. And the next verse is Brahmarpanam Brahmavi. Everything that is happening is happening by the self alone. So now that when I'm working in this world, I'm offering myself which I consider to be myself right now is my sense of perception. Sense organs of actions in the service of the self, the greater self.\n\nSo now everything which I'm doing is offering to the self by myself. The limited self offering its own self for the service of the self. In this attitude, when he works in this world, he's also not getting attached to any actions because he obviously is not really performing any actions for himself. So both are the various ways the Yogi sees this world. Either this way where the world is offering to himself, or he is offering himself to the greater self. Both are the techniques with which he can continue working in this world, but not getting attached to the actions.\n\nAnd then we have seen that the agnas can be performed in 12 different ways. The fire you have to kindle for this yajna is not the physical fire, but the fire of your self restraint. So Samyama Agni, he's going to start with kindling first his fire of restraint. That restraint first can be at this sense level, sensual perceptions he limits to a point where he does not get attached to them. So restraining the senses is the first method we use it. The second method is the mental restraining the perception.\n\nSo whatever the perception comes, he obviously restrain its impression, does not let that perception leave any impression on his mind. So it's a mental level. And the next level of yajnas we have seen is the intellectual level, Swadhyaya Yajna. I constantly reflect on what is the truth about myself. Constantly asking question, who is it that tells me that I am doing this? So that's swadhya yajna at the intellectual level, which is we call gnana yajna.\n\nThen Bhagavan also enumerated that there are other yajnas as well. But all of them we have seen is performing yajnas in the mental level. By kindling the fire of restraint, restraining of the senses, restraining of the mind, or restraining the intellect into the inquiry of what is the self. We have seen there are other methods available. There is not really one method fits all we know because human beings are made in various different permutations and combinations. Sattva, rajas and Tamas, whichever is most conducive for me, I should be practicing.\n\nBut the goal is to perform actions in Yajna spirit. That's basically the goal. Evam, Bahvida, Yajna, Vitatha, Brahmana, mukhe. Thus there are many yajnas lying at the mouth of Brahman. These are not the only yajnas that can be practiced. But there's a limitation for the poet -- he cannot enumerate a list of thousands of Yajnas.\n\nThere are many methods available to you. Vitatha Brahmanamukha -- they are scattered at the mouth of Brahman, at the gate leading to Brahman, at the threshold of perception of the Brahman. There are many paths which are leading towards that that will open the door for you. So any of that, whatever path I take, as long as I have taken the correct path towards my goal, that goal will be available to me. Karma Janaan Vidhi Taan, Sarvaan Evam Gnatva Vimoksha Se.\n\nBut know that all those paths are born out of actions. In other words, you cannot sit back and relax and say things will be done and someday I will have a realization. It requires your self-effort. No matter which path you take, there is no easy shortcut. All of them require you to put your own self-effort to get there. Karma Jan Viddhi -- there is not a single path where you just stay relaxed and it comes to you.\n\nActions are very much essential in each part. Actions are the binding force right now and I'm trying to get out of it. Actions are the only means available to me to get to Brahman. As long as I put my self efforts on a right path. Bhagavan says Vimoksha Se you will achieve the moksha. As long as I take the right route to go to New York.\n\nWhether I take 95 north through the New Jersey Turnpike or go via Route 95 through Philadelphia -- as long as I know that this path is leading towards my goal. Just sitting down here thinking about it, I will never go to New York. But putting my efforts into it -- Tan Sarvan Evam Ganatwa Vimoksha Sey -- they're all going to take you to the same goal as long as you put your self-effort in a diligent and honest manner.\n\nSo the next verse says Sreyan Dravyam Yagnath Gnana Yajnaha Parantabah Sarva Karma Ahilam Partha Gnane Parisamarpiate -- which path should I take? He said the Gnana Yajna is clearly better than the Dravya Yajna.\n\nThis is not an indication that this all the various paths which are described as one is better than other. All paths are gonna lead you. As long as you put your self efforts in a clear understanding what my goal is will get you there. However, the culture in the environment may mislead me. Me just writing a check to the Hindu Center -- I think that I have earned some punyas. Bhagavan says that Dravya Yajna will get you very little, because the whole intention behind writing the check makes that check what it is worth to you, not to the Hindu Center.\n\nThe Hindu Center gets the same value. I write a check for $101 -- the $101 they can cash. But whether that gives me value is all about my intentions. What efforts did I put in, with what intentions, with what understanding -- that will determine my reward. Therefore he says Sreyan Dravyam Yagnath Gnana Yajnah Paramta.\n\nWhatever your perception of that offering, as long as the knowledge does not take place, that offering does not get you much. Therefore knowledge is superior to the physical act of performing Yajna. I may be exercising, but not with a clear understanding of what I'm trying to get out of it. Then obviously it won't have the same result as exercising with a clear goal. Disciplined actions with a clear plan, clear knowledge of what this action should yield -- that will get you much greater results.\n\nAnd you go to American Fitness. Do you have a trainer? I don't have a trainer. Why do I need a trainer? That trainer will give you this gnana. Which exercise will be better for you?\n\nI may be putting lot of efforts but in a wrong direction. Yesterday we were at somebody's house and somebody took out of the list of what food does not goes with what. In the end we said if you follow this, we will not be able to eat anything. He said parotta should not be eaten with dahi yogurt. So Punjabis are all gone! See, even that knowledge, if it is put in the right context, may have some value.\n\nObviously the whole of our Ayurveda is about parhej. You have to regulate your diet, and then you don't need other medication. But just doing upavas without thinking may actually make me sick.",
      "reflection": "Verse 31 declares that those who partake of the nectar remaining from yajna attain the eternal Brahman, while those who perform no yajna find no happiness even in this world, let alone the next. Verse 32 reveals that many types of yajna are spread before Brahman's gate, and all are born of action (karmajan). Knowing this, one becomes liberated. Verse 33 makes a crucial distinction: \"Shreyan dravyamayad yajnat jnana-yajnah\" - the sacrifice of knowledge is superior to material sacrifice, for all actions in their entirety culminate in knowledge (sarvam karmakhilam partha jnane parisamapyate).\n\nThis teaching clarifies that while many paths exist, knowledge (jnana) is the ultimate goal toward which all other practices lead. Writing a charity check has value, but the intention and understanding behind it determines its true worth. The same external action performed with different levels of awareness produces vastly different results. Like having a trainer at the gym who guides your efforts optimally, knowledge directs and elevates all other practices. Without understanding why you are doing something, even sincere effort may be misdirected.\n\nFor daily practice, evaluate not just what you do but the knowledge underlying it. Before any spiritual practice - whether charity, discipline, or study - ask: What am I trying to achieve? How does this lead toward self-knowledge? Just as the teaching says all paths are \"karma-jan\" (born of action), your own efforts are indispensable. There is no shortcut where things happen without your participation. Today, choose one practice and examine the knowledge component: What do you understand about why this works? What are you still confused about? \"Evam jnatva vimokshyase\" - knowing thus, you shall be liberated. Make your practice conscious, not mechanical."

      "commentary": "What is my purpose and destiny? We have been discussing chapter four, Gnana Karma Sannyasa Yoga Yoga of renouncing action in knowledge. So we have seen in the beginning of chapter three, Bhagavan had said that there are two paths always available for a seeker to seek the ultimate knowledge. The Gnana Yogi in a Sankhyana Karma Yoga yogina. For the yogis, the Karma Yoga and for the Gnani, the Gnana Yoga. So chapter three we discussed Karma Yoga.\n\nThis is where one needs to start. Bhagavan Saha that if you are engaged in this world of activities, in this rajasic world of activities, then it will start with Karma Yoga. And Karma Yoga simply says act with the balanced mind without expecting any particular fruits of your action and act efficiently. That's basically Karma Yoga. Remain balanced in any situation. Do not react overly in any situation.\n\nBhagawan said, you start with that. Purpose of that is to purify your mind and intellectual so that you can function very efficiently in this world. But what type of action I should be performing in that manner was described in chapter four. In the beginning, Bhagawan said, you should know what is karma and what is akarma. You should know what is vikarma, what is akarma. So you should have some basic gauge to decide actions are appropriate or not appropriate there.\n\nBhagavan said that when you reach a point where action seems inaction and inaction seems action, you now come to understand what action is all about. And how do I get to that point? Bhagavan said, Yajnaar Thaat Karmano Anyatra Lokwayam Karma Bandana. You get bondage from your action in this world because you are acting in this world as an individual trying to compete with the rest of the world. It's creating sorrows and unhappiness and fears and greed and jealousy. That's because this concept of duality that I am an island by myself, the world is out there to get me.\n\nBhagwan said that you overcome by performing your Actions in the field of Yajna. Yajna is something you're not doing for yourself. You're sacrificing something for greater good. So if you go to Hindu temple and Panditji is doing Havana, every mantra start with Idhamna Mama, this is not mine. Up till now I thought this is mine. But right now I'm offering it for the greater good in the holy fire.\n\nSomething I always thought is mine -- I offer it as no longer belonging to me. That is what we call charity. The money which I thought is mine, I write a check and send it to a non-profit organization. I say, \"Now it is not mine, it is yours. You do whatever you need to do.\" So that's the act of Yajna.\n\nYajna is to sacrifice something which you thought is yours. But you came to the conclusion that really does not belong to me. I heard one of the CNN executive retiring and he said learn, earn and then return. Learn the knowledge, how the business works. Then earn, make money and then return. Return back to the community.\n\nAnd that's what most of us one way or other do. Because we have seen that when a person dies, he cannot take anything with him. He acquires things, thinks they are his own, and then eventually gives up, leaves everything here and goes away. So Bhagavan said that you have to understand this concept even while acting in this world. Therefore you have to act in the spirit of Yajna so that you come to realize the oneness. Once you perform this, you will get the Brahmajnana. I have this translation of Gnaneshwar Maharaj's Gnaneshwari.\n\nThis chapter is actually titled in Gnaneshwari as Brahma Yajna Prasantsa Brahmajna Prasansa Nama Chaturtha Dhyayah. So here we say Gnana Karma Sanyasi Yogana. There are books I have seen which simply says Gnani Yoga. So chapter four is about knowledge. Knowledge about your own self and how to get it. So the two paths which Bhagavan had initially described that is always available right from the beginning of this universe for a seeker to realize the truth is Karma Yoga.\n\nAnd then Gnana Yoga, Karma Yoga. When you are not ready yet, very Rajasic, perform Karma Yoga. But then ultimately you have to have Gnana. The knowledge, what it is all about, why my actions are not my actions. And when I come to realize, it becomes inaction. It's no longer any action which is belonging to me.\n\nSo in verse 33 we say, Sarvam karma akhilam Partha gnane parisamapyate. Bhagavan came to that final statement saying, O Partha. All the actions, good, bad and ugly that you had been performing or you think you had been performing once you know the knowledge, they get all dissolved once you achieve their knowledge. What is their knowledge? He said we would learn that. Brahma arpanam Brahmahavihi Brahma agno Brahmahutam.\n\nEverything that I perceive in this world that I consider to be something other than me is also not different than me. The same entity which makes me who I am, the very same entity makes the world of plurality what it is. Once I come to that conclusion, Bhagavan said, Sarvam karma akhilam grana parishama pyyade. All actions which I am either very proud of or very afraid of that I may have to pay for them. Those actions all will get resolved. So in last verse 34, Bhagavan said, the only way to get it is to someone who has realized this knowledge.\n\nI can only learn something from someone who has experienced it. If I am dreaming and suffering in my dream, only other waker can see that I may be going through a nightmare and awake me. Are you having a nightmare? Another dreamer cannot do that. Another dreamer who is also dreaming his own dream. He cannot wake me up from my dream.\n\nOnly a waker who is not dreaming can see that I am having a nightmare and can wake me up. So Bhagavan said, go to a guru. You may not call them a guru -- you may give them another title. But go to someone who has experienced this knowledge, someone who has experienced this truth that there is no duality in this world. The world is the manifestation of the same reality.\n\nThat duality is created out of my own ignorance about the nature of this universe. In Prakriti there is multiplicity. Prakriti itself is one entity. But in that there is multiplicity. Just as I as one person. But I have multiple limbs which has different parts and different functions.\n\nBut I know that all these limbs are nothing but me. And therefore there is no conflict ever. My right hand is not fighting with left hand and left hand is not fighting with my right hand. Because there is a unity of thinking. And that knowledge, you can only get it from a great person who has realized this Tadviddhi Prani pati ne pari prasnayana sevaya. You have to put your own efforts.\n\nYou can't really get it just by thinking about it. You have to put your own efforts with that humility that you do not know. Right now, what I know is creating more conflict for me, creating sorrows, unhappiness, fears, jealousy, greed -- all of that. Because I think the world is out there to get me and I need to take care of myself. So once you know -- Tadviddhi Prani Patena Pari Prashnena -- by inquiring what is real and what is unreal, what is my true self and what is not my true self.\n\nSevayah -- by serving the teacher. Upadekshyanti Tegnanam Gnaninah Tattvadarsinah. And if you find that person -- if you are sincere, you will find such a person -- that teacher will point you in the right direction, will give you the direction on how to find your own self. You have to find yourself, but you will find a guide to get to your destination. Now, is this something I'll know one time and then forget?\n\nThere are a lot of things I have learnt before but have now forgotten -- that is of no great value. \"Neil, do you know calculus?\" I learned it in my college days but I know nothing about it anymore. Bhagawan said no, this knowledge is different. Once you know it, you will never get confused like this again. You are right now confused about whether to fight or not to fight this battle.\n\nKnowing that knowledge, you will never get confused again. Bhutani Ashena Drashasi Atmani Athomai. That is because right now my problem is that I see that world is competing with me and therefore I'm getting confused about how to protect myself. And that's what is creating confusion. In Arjuna's case, his own people are there and he has to kill them. He has no problem killing others, only his own people.\n\nHe's worried about killing them. But once this sense of \"I and mine\" is dissolved, you will not have any problem. Two people facing each other in a dark alley are afraid of each other because one doesn't know who the other one is. So they hide from each other because they think the other person is out there to rob me. But once they realize that other person is my friend then all the fears are gone. So that identification is the unifying factor.\n\nBhagawan said, once that identification takes place -- Atmani Athomai -- you will see that all beings are in your own self. The self which I consider my own self is not limited to this body, mind and intellect. It is all-pervading and encompassing everything. That teacher will make you realize that your self is that supreme self where everything is contained. And you will see that in me -- \"me,\" Bhagavan said, meaning Krishna himself.\n\nYou will see in God all the beings. That's nothing but your own self. When this takes place, all the fears will be dissolved, all the negative tendencies of your mind will dissolve, and you will be free from all the problems that belong to you.\n\nSo Bhagavan said Apiched -- now I come to the point of gauging my own capability. Am I capable of achieving this? And 99 times out of 100 we come to the conclusion: that's for the sannyasis, that's for somebody else, not for me.\n\nIt may be, but I don't know whether I'm going to get it in this lifetime or not. Don't worry about the lifetime. Because you do not know what your lifetime is. This life is not the only existence you have. Bahuni, me, Vyatitani, Janmani, Tawachaljani. You and I have spent many, many lives before we never perished and we will be there forever.\n\nSo therefore time is not of any consequence here. Neither your own qualification. If you consider yourself the best among sinners -- even criminals have categories, the best and the worst, from a stupid criminal to the most intelligent criminal. All the jewel thief movies I used to love in my younger days.\n\nBecause jewel thief is not an ordinary person, he is so intelligent. If you consider that you are the worst of sinners, then also it does not exclude you. Because sin is nothing but the other aspect of karma. If it is utilized in a proper field, it becomes merit. If it is in a wrong field with a wrong attitude, it becomes sin. So all you are doing up till now is what you consider your sins is you're applying your ability to act with a wrong attitude.\n\nThose attitudes and the consequent experiences are creating negative impressions on your mind. Therefore you consider yourself a sinner. But you cannot be a sinner, because you are part of that pristine reality.",
      "reflection": "Verse 34 prescribes the method for gaining knowledge: \"Tadviddhi pranipatena pariprashnena sevaya\" - learn it through prostration (humility), questioning, and service to those wise ones who have realized the truth (jnaninas tattva-darshinah). Verse 35 promises that having known this, you will never again fall into confusion, for you will see all beings in your own Self and in Me. The powerful verse 36 offers hope even to the greatest sinner: \"Api ched asi papebhyah sarvebhyah papa-krittamah\" - even if you are the worst of sinners, the boat of knowledge will carry you across all evil.\n\nThe teaching emphasizes that spiritual knowledge cannot be gained through intellect alone - it requires a relationship with a realized teacher and one's own sincere effort. Just as only a waking person can awaken someone from a nightmare (another dreamer cannot help), only one who has realized the truth can guide us out of our confusion. The three elements - prostration (humility), questioning (sincere inquiry), and service (devoted practice) - form the complete approach. Once this knowledge dawns, duality dissolves; you see all beings as your own Self because they truly are.\n\nFor today's practice, cultivate the three elements of learning. Practice humility by acknowledging what you do not know - your current knowledge is creating your confusion and suffering. Formulate genuine questions about what is real and unreal, what is your true Self and what is not. Serve the teaching through dedicated practice, not just intellectual study. Reflect on verse 35's promise: if you truly knew that all beings are in your Self and in God, how would you treat the people you encounter today? And take heart from verse 36 - whatever you consider your \"sins\" are merely actions performed with wrong attitudes. Your true Self, part of pristine reality, cannot be a sinner. The boat of knowledge can carry you across any ocean of past mistakes."

You get bondage from your action in this world because you are acting in this world as an individual trying to compete with the rest of the world. It's creating sorrows and unhappiness and fears and greed and jealousy. That's because this concept of duality that I am an island by myself, the world is out there to get me.\n\nBhagwan said that you overcome by performing your Actions in the field of Yajna. Yajna is something you're not doing for yourself. You're sacrificing something for greater good. So if you go to Hindu temple and Panditji is doing Havana, every mantra start with Idhamna Mama, this is not mine. Up till now I thought this is mine. But right now I'm offering it for the greater good in the holy fire.\n\nSomething I always thought is mine -- I offer it as no longer belonging to me. That is what we call charity. The money which I thought is mine, I write a check and send it to a non-profit organization. I say, \"Now it is not mine, it is yours. You do whatever you need to do.\" So that's the act of Yajna.\n\nYajna is to sacrifice something which you thought is yours. But you came to the conclusion that really does not belong to me. I heard one of the CNN executive retiring and he said learn, earn and then return. Learn the knowledge, how the business works. Then earn, make money and then return. Return back to the community.\n\nAnd that's what most of us one way or other do. Because we have seen that when a person dies, he cannot take anything with him. He acquires things, thinks they are his own, and then eventually gives up, leaves everything here and goes away. So Bhagavan said that you have to understand this concept even while acting in this world. Therefore you have to act in the spirit of Yajna so that you come to realize the oneness. Once you perform this, you will get the Brahmajnana. I have this translation of Gnaneshwar Maharaj's Gnaneshwari.\n\nThis chapter is actually titled in Gnaneshwari as Brahma Yajna Prasantsa Brahmajna Prasansa Nama Chaturtha Dhyayah. So here we say Gnana Karma Sanyasi Yogana. There are books I have seen which simply says Gnani Yoga. So chapter four is about knowledge. Knowledge about your own self and how to get it. So the two paths which Bhagavan had initially described that is always available right from the beginning of this universe for a seeker to realize the truth is Karma Yoga.\n\nAnd then Gnana Yoga, Karma Yoga. When you are not ready yet, very Rajasic, perform Karma Yoga. But then ultimately you have to have Gnana. The knowledge, what it is all about, why my actions are not my actions. And when I come to realize, it becomes inaction. It's no longer any action which is belonging to me.\n\nSo in verse 33 we say, Sarvam karma akhilam Partha gnane parisamapyate. Bhagavan came to that final statement saying, O Partha. All the actions, good, bad and ugly that you had been performing or you think you had been performing once you know the knowledge, they get all dissolved once you achieve their knowledge. What is their knowledge? He said we would learn that. Brahma arpanam Brahmahavihi Brahma agno Brahmahutam.\n\nEverything that I perceive in this world that I consider to be something other than me is also not different than me. The same entity which makes me who I am, the very same entity makes the world of plurality what it is. Once I come to that conclusion, Bhagavan said, Sarvam karma akhilam grana parishama pyyade. All actions which I am either very proud of or very afraid of that I may have to pay for them. Those actions all will get resolved. So in last verse 34, Bhagavan said, the only way to get it is to someone who has realized this knowledge.\n\nI can only learn something from someone who has experienced it. If I am dreaming and suffering in my dream, only other waker can see that I may be going through a nightmare and awake me. Are you having a nightmare? Another dreamer cannot do that. Another dreamer who is also dreaming his own dream. He cannot wake me up from my dream.\n\nOnly a waker who is not dreaming can see that I am having a nightmare and can wake me up. So Bhagavan said, go to a guru. You may not call him a guru. You may give him another title. But go to someone who has experienced this knowledge, experienced this truth that there is no duality in this world. The world is the manifestation of the same reality.\n\nThat duality is created out of my own ignorance about the nature of this universe. In Prakriti there is multiplicity. Prakriti itself is one entity. But in that there is multiplicity. Just as I as one person. But I have multiple limbs which has different parts and different functions.\n\nBut I know that all these limbs are nothing but me. And therefore there is no conflict ever. My right hand is not fighting with left hand and left hand is not fighting with my right hand. Because there is a unity of thinking. And that knowledge, you can only get it from a great person who has realized this Tadviddhi Prani pati ne pari prasnayana sevaya. You have to put your own efforts.\n\nYou can't really get it just by thinking about it. You have to put your own efforts with that humility that you do not know. Right now, what I know is creating more conflict for me, creating sorrows, unhappiness, fears, jealousy, greed -- all of that. Because I think the world is out there to get me and I need to take care of myself. So once you know -- Tadviddhi Prani Patena Pari Prashnena -- by inquiring what is real and what is unreal, what is my true self and what is not my true self.\n\nSevayah -- by serving the teacher. Upadekshyanti Tegnanam Gnaninah Tattvadarsinah. And if you find that person -- if you are sincere, you will find such a person -- that teacher will point you in the right direction, will give you the direction on how to find your own self. You have to find yourself, but you will find a guide to get to your destination. Now, is this something I'll know one time and then forget?\n\nThere are a lot of things I have learnt before but have now forgotten -- that is of no great value. \"Neil, do you know calculus?\" I learned it in my college days but I know nothing about it anymore. Bhagawan said no, this knowledge is different. Once you know it, you will never get confused like this again. You are right now confused about whether to fight or not to fight this battle.\n\nKnowing that knowledge, you will never get confused again. Bhutani Ashena Drashasi Atmani Athomai. That is because right now my problem is that I see that world is competing with me and therefore I'm getting confused about how to protect myself. And that's what is creating confusion. In Arjuna's case my people are there and I have to kill them. I have no problem killing others, only my people.\n\nI'm worried about killing them. But once in this I and mind, once dissolved, you will not have any problem. Two people facing each other in a dark alley are afraid of each other because one doesn't know who the other one is. So they hide from each other because they think the other person is out there to rob me. But once they realize that other person is my friend then all the fears are gone. So that identification is the unifying factor.\n\nBhagawan said, once that identification takes place -- Atmani Athomai -- you will see that all beings are in your own self. The self which I consider my own self is not limited to this body, mind and intellect. It is all-pervading and encompassing everything. That teacher will make you realize that your self is that supreme self where everything is contained. And you will see that in me -- \"me,\" Bhagavan said, meaning Krishna himself.\n\nYou will see in God all the beings. That's nothing but your own self. When this takes place, all the fears will be dissolved, all the negative tendencies of your mind will dissolve, and you will be free from all the problems that belong to you.\n\nSo Bhagavan said Apiched -- now I come to the point of gauging my own capability. Am I capable of achieving this? And 99 times out of 100 we come to the conclusion: that's for the sannyasis, that's for somebody else, not for me.\n\nIt may be, but I don't know whether I'm going to get it in this lifetime or not. Don't worry about the lifetime. Because you do not know what your lifetime is. This life is not the only existence you have. Bahuni, me, Vyatitani, Janmani, Tawachaljani. You and I have spent many, many lives before we never perished and we will be there forever.\n\nSo therefore time is not of any consequence here. Neither your own qualification. If you consider yourself the best among sinners -- even criminals have categories, the best and the worst, from a stupid criminal to the most intelligent criminal. All the jewel thief movies I used to love in my younger days.\n\nBecause jewel thief is not an ordinary person, he is so intelligent. If you consider that you are the worst of sinners, then also it does not exclude you. Because sin is nothing but the other aspect of karma. If it is utilized in a proper field, it becomes merit. If it is in a wrong field with a wrong attitude, it becomes sin. So all you are doing up till now is what you consider your sins is you're applying your ability to act with a wrong attitude.\n\nThose attitudes and the consequent experiences are creating negative impressions on your mind. Therefore you consider yourself a sinner. But you cannot be a sinner, because you are part of that pristine reality.",
      "reflection": "Verse 37 uses the powerful metaphor of fire: \"Yathaidhamsi samiddho 'gnir bhasmasat kurute\" - as a blazing fire reduces fuel to ashes, so does the fire of knowledge burn all karma to ashes. When different materials are burned, they all become one undifferentiated ash; similarly, knowledge dissolves the distinctions between \"good\" and \"bad\" karma into the unity of Brahman. Verse 38 declares nothing is as purifying as knowledge (na hi jnanena sadrisham pavitram iha vidyate), and the one perfected in yoga finds it within their own Self in time. Verse 39 gives the three requirements: faith (shraddha), devotion to the goal (tatparah), and sense-control (samyatendriyah). With these, one attains knowledge and quickly reaches supreme peace.\n\nThe teaching addresses both the power of knowledge and the practical requirements for gaining it. Faith (shraddha) means trust that the destination exists - like trusting that Hawaii exists before saving for the trip. Tatparah means burning desire - like the fire in the belly that makes one champion prevail over another equally skilled competitor. Samyatendriyah means discipline - the controlled, sustained effort that transforms aspiration into attainment. Without all three, the journey stalls.\n\nFor daily practice, assess honestly where you stand on these three requirements. Do you truly have faith that a state of lasting peace exists and is attainable for you, not just for sannyasis and saints? Do you have the burning desire (tatparah) to reach it, or is it just an interesting intellectual idea? Are you exercising the discipline (samyatendriyah) that moves you toward the goal, or do desires constantly pull you off course? Remember that the timing is not entirely in your hands - \"kalena atmani vindati\" - in time, one finds it in the Self. Your job is to keep marching on the path, trusting that the purifying fire of knowledge will eventually burn away all that obscures your true nature."

      "commentary": "So far in Bhagavad Gita and in our discussion about Vedantic philosophy, we have learnt that Brahman is pristine, imperishable, immutable and without any attributes. That Brahman, which is all pervading, nothing exists outside Brahman. So there is no good or evil which is beyond Brahman, outside of Brahman. And if Brahman is all pervading, then obviously the good and evil, as I perceive, must be residing within the realm of Brahman. But these are two contradictory assertions. One, Brahman is all pervading, pristine, and there is no good and evil.\n\nThere is no happiness and sorrows in Brahman. At the same token, if the happiness and sorrows do exist in my life, then this happiness and sorrows must be existing outside of Brahman. When I make that assertion, I make Brahman limited. Because now that realm of happiness and sorrow is outside the realm of Brahman, which makes Brahman limited. Either there is happiness and sorrow in Brahman, or there is no happiness and sorrows. And Brahman remains pristine, unborn, imperishable, untainted.\n\nSo that is the quest of our life. So then we have looked at how I experience my life and what is my relationship to Brahman. So we have seen that Brahman expresses as Purusha and Prakriti, matter and energy, mind and matter, consciousness and matter. When I think about consciousness, I'm conscious of everything, but not about my own self. So this Purusha remains untainted. The Prakriti, it seems, goes through changes.\n\nThis Prakriti, which is the manifest world, has plurality. And that's where we see changes. World, as I knew yesterday, does not exist today. It has already changed. So it seems Prakruti is going through changes. So we have learned that Prakruti has three Gunas, Sattva, Rajas and Tamas.\n\nThese three Gunas, when they are in equilibrium, there is no phenomenal world. When my three Gunas in my self at a micro level, are in equilibrium, there is no experience which I call deep Sleep. In deep sleep there is no Sattva, there is no Rajas, pure Tamas and everything is in equilibrium. And therefore I do not experience anything. So there is no phenomenal world when these three gunas are in equilibrium. It is only the touch of consciousness when I wake up from my deep sleep that the world of phenomena comes in place.\n\nSo I must make a journey from that world of Brahman which is pristine to the world of phenomena which I experience. So the world of my happiness and sorrows are within the phenomenal world. So Bhagavan in Sankhya Yoga told, you will experience this bliss if you lose your identification with this individual being that you consider yourself to be. And for that he said, you have to purify your internal instrument. The instrument which you have to experience the world outside is mind and intellect. I am experiencing the world outside through my mind and intellect supported by my senses.\n\nRiver Bhagavan in chapter three gave us a simple method of Karma Yoga to purify your mind and intellect. Right now has come to the conclusion that my happiness outside in this world and I need to acquire it. That notion is creating this conflict with this world. And therefore I'm working hard in this world. Actions are motivated by my desire to achieve that state of perfect happiness. All my actions right now are either to get happiness or avoid unhappiness.\n\nSo Bhagawan said, you are motivated by your quest for happiness. All you have to do now is find out where your happiness is. He said that the happiness lies within yourself and you need to find it. The senses are creating sense experiences, as we have discussed, and my mind gets deluded by Moha -- attachment. When I see something which I like, I get attached to it, then I want to acquire it.\n\nAnd if I can't acquire it, then I get angry. So Bhagavan said, you have to purify your mind and intellect, and therefore start with Karma Yoga. Perform your actions because you're motivated to act in this world. But just change your attitude towards your actions. Your actions should expand your identity. Your problem on one side is that your identity is so limited -- to yourself, to your body, to your mind, to intellect. You need to expand it more and more.\n\nIf you come to the conclusion that everything that is happening in this world is perfect, then you have less complaint about this world. If Brahman is perfect, then Purusha has to be perfect. And if Purusha is perfect, Prakriti has to be perfect, because Purusha and Prakriti are nothing but the expression of the same Brahman. One cannot be imperfect while another remains perfect. If Brahman is perfect, his creation also has to be perfect.\n\nSo Brahman plus Maya, as we have discussed is Ishvara. If Ishvara is perfect, his creation also has to be perfect. If I take that notion that this world is perfect then the imperfections which I see has to be because of my own ignorance. My complaint about this world is about its imperfection. It is not as perfect as I would like it to be to make me perfectly happy. Bhagavan said, when you change your vision, your drishti, then you will be able to see that this world is perfect.\n\nEverything is in this world is the necessity. Without that the world will not function. The world will function perfectly for you if you start seeing it as perfect. So that journey was Karma Yoga, Yoga of Action. To expand my identity, more I work for the greater good, more I identify with that greater good. Then achieve that sense of belonging to that greater self.\n\nSo Bhagavan said, you perform Karma Yoga. To perform Karma Yoga, Bhagavan has given us Yajna. And Bhagavan says, once you perform this Yajna diligently, you will achieve knowledge. That knowledge is not outside of you but within you. You already know yourself, but right now it is veiled by your identification with your limited self and your sense of duality between the world and you. That knowledge will remove that veil.\n\nSo what we have seen in last few verses is it says Yatha e Dhansi, Samidha, Agnihi Basma Sat Gurute. Just as blazing fire burns everything to ashes, now there is no duality left in that fuel. If you put fire in different things, the wood and something else and paper, all that has duality before. Once it becomes ashes, they all become one. Gnana Agnihi, Sarvakarmani, Basma Saat Kurute Datta. The knowledge about yourself will burn all your actions which you consider either good or evil.\n\nAll of that will merge into one. In this world there is nothing but the same entity. And therefore there cannot be too many different things. Everything has to be the expression of the same entity. I don't identify myself as my mind is separate and I am separate. So at my level I say my mind and body are one and the same.\n\nMy present is nothing but an imaginary line between my past and future. Past and future are not two separate entities but continuum of my own self. So Bhagavan said that knowledge will burn all your Actions just as when I wake up from the dream, all the actions in the dream are resolved. No consequences of any bad, good or ugly actions in my dream. So Bhagavan said, in your understanding all actions will burn to ashes. Nahi Gnane Sadrusam Pavitram Iha Vidyate -- there is no greater purifier of your own actions than the knowledge that you are not the doer.\n\nThis world is functioning as Bhagavan has designed. Once you know that everything in this world is perfect, that it is as it must be and I am a part of it, then this knowledge will purify all the impurities in your mind which are creating this confusion. There is no greater purifier. I try my best to purify my experience, make it all good, but it is not really working. Once you know this knowledge -- that your self is nothing but an expression of the supreme self -- all your actions will be dissolved and you will be purified of all your sins.\n\nTatsvayam Yogasansiddha Kalena Atmani Vindhati -- the person who is established in Yoga (and we have seen the definition of Yoga before) is one whose mind is completely balanced, who does not get affected by any situation. Why? Because he has stopped seeing the world as good and evil, has stopped seeing the world as \"I versus the world.\" His mind is completely balanced. Yoga Sansiddha Tatsvayam -- he himself will recognize this truth in his own self in time to come. It will not happen overnight, not because, as Swamiji says, \"some guru put his hand on me.\" But it will happen because I made the effort to purify my mind and intellect by gaining the knowledge about who I am.\n\nThat journey may take time. But it will happen. Is it a year from now? We don't know. But it will happen. Your job is to keep marching on the path of Karma. Use the methods which are available in Sastra.\n\nAll these yagnas which we have seen. Bhavan said, at the mouth of Brahman, there are many such yajnas are available. In other words, there are so many paths. Whichever path is the most conducive for your own situation, you should take that. But your responsibility is to walk that path and not just know about it. So Bhagawan said, Saddhavan Lavateghnana now for that to take that path, first of all you have to have faith that there is something which I can achieve.\n\nThat destination is available. If I want to go to some fictional place, there is no chance that I will ever reach there no matter how hard I try. A fictional city created in some fictional novel -- I think people have tried to find Sherlock Holmes' home. We all know Sherlock Holmes is a fictional character and therefore everything described is somewhat fictional.\n\nBut people still go to London to find Sherlock Holmes' home. That's a fictional destination. If I know Sherlock Holmes did not exist, then his home cannot exist, and there is no chance for me to find where he lived. But if I know the destination I'm looking for exists -- there is Hawaii on this planet, and I can go to Hawaii if I make efforts and save enough money and take my journey. If I have that faith, that Shraddha -- Bhagawan Sankaracharya says, Guru Vedanta Vakya Adisu Vishwasah -- if I have trust in what my teachers have told me, that H2O makes water, then someday I can go into the laboratory, make it happen, and experience it myself.\n\nBut if I think this formula is wrong, that what my teacher is teaching me is wrong, then I will never get there. That Shraddha is trust in what I have learned from others through their experience. I trust that there is a destination where pure happiness lies.\n\nTatparaha Sanyat Indriyaha Labhate Gnanam -- one who is Tatparaha, who is anxious, who wants to go there. Not only do I know about Hawaii, but I have an intense desire to go there. We have heard that in Wimbledon, both players are equally prepared and equally capable.\n\nOne who wins is the one who has the fire in his belly: \"I need to win this match.\" That anxiousness, that burning desire to achieve it. Tatparaha. Sanyat Indriyaha -- I may have faith that there is a destination, and I may also have this great desire, but I am not disciplined. I want to be a great athlete but I have no discipline. So these three -- if I cultivate them, I have faith that there is a state where I can be perfectly happy, and I want to get there.",
      "reflection": "The closing verses of Chapter 4 issue both a warning and a call to action. Verse 40 warns: the ignorant, the faithless, and the doubter are destroyed (ajnas cha ashraddadhanas cha samshayatma vinashyati). For the one who doubts, there is no happiness in this world or the next. Verse 41 contrasts this with the liberated one: who has renounced action through yoga, whose doubts have been severed by knowledge, who is self-possessed (atmavantam) - such a person is not bound by action. The chapter culminates in verse 42's stirring command: \"Tasmad ajnana-sambhutam hritstham jnanasina atmanah chittvainam samshayam yogam atishthottishtha Bharata\" - therefore, with the sword of knowledge, cut asunder this doubt born of ignorance dwelling in your heart. Take refuge in yoga. Arise!\n\nThe three enemies named - ignorance (ajna), faithlessness (ashraddhah), and doubt (samshaya) - are interconnected. Ignorance breeds doubt; doubt undermines faith; and without faith, no sustained effort is possible. The \"doubt dwelling in the heart\" (hritstham samshayam) is the fundamental uncertainty about whether liberation is real and attainable. Krishna's solution is dramatic: take up the sword of knowledge and cut it away. This is not passive acceptance but active, decisive action.\n\nFor your closing practice with Chapter 4, examine the doubts dwelling in your own heart. What fundamental uncertainties prevent you from wholehearted commitment to the spiritual path? Write them down. Then consider: are these doubts born of genuine inquiry or from ignorance and lack of experience? Recognize that doubt itself is not the enemy - samshaya that leads to inquiry is healthy. But chronic, paralyzing doubt that prevents action is destructive. Today, take one concrete step to \"arise\" (uttishtha) - whether through study, practice, or service. The chapter's teaching is complete: through Karma Yoga purify the mind; through Jnana Yoga understand who you truly are; through Yajna act for the greater good. Now, armed with the sword of knowledge, arise and fulfill your dharma!"

      "commentary": "We completed chapter four and started discussing chapter five. Chapter four was Gnana Karma Sannyasa Yoga, Yoga of Liberation of actions in Knowledge. Now chapter five is called Karma Sannyasa Yoga, Yoga of Renunciation of Actions. Some of the books only title it Sannyasa Yoga -- basically, Yoga for renunciation or true renunciation. And the word \"true\" is very meaningful here, because renunciation can be of many types.\n\nAnd we have been discussing what is true renunciation. Chapters one and two give us the background and the insight into the nature of the self. Chapters three and four talked about Karma Yoga, Yoga of action. So our journey is from inertness, which is the true nature of this body. In Prakriti everything is inert, and our body is nothing but part of this Prakriti. So the very nature of our self is inert.\n\nGiven a choice, what we want to do is nothing. So what are you doing this weekend, Neil? And my answer is nothing. I really don't plan anything. The real joy is not doing anything. So that's our basic nature is inertia, inertness.\n\nSo inertia is our nature, and therefore the danger is that we may fall into tamas. The first quest is to whip yourself up into rajas, to start doing activity. You can't do activity unless there is motivation. What is the motivation? My desires, my goals. To acquire and accomplish -- that is the motivation. It is very, very important to have motivation.\n\nSo all my activities are driven by my motivation, which is desires. From inertia I have to go to desire-prompted activities. That's where I do things, accomplish, and achieve. But then I have to rise above those, because I realize that's not the end -- that's the means to go to the end. So the next goal is to have desireless activities, which is the Yoga. We have seen that Yoga is activity performed keeping the greater good in mind. The Yajnas -- twelve different types of Yajnas described in the last chapters -- are meant to prompt ourselves into a level of activity which will purify our mind and intellect.\n\nAnd why are we purifying our mind and intellect? To get to the next stage where we can realize who we are -- the self. So that's meditation, Dhyana, contemplating on your own self. It's a journey from inertia to realizing yourself. Chapters three and four prepared us for desireless activities, Yajna. As we said, the definition of Yajna is activity which I do for the greater good.\n\nKeeping the good of the entire society, the community, the cosmos, the universe, humanity in mind -- that is my Yajna. There are twelve different methods we have learned. Now, once I have learned the art of action, I have to go beyond actions. The next two chapters, five and six, focus on how to transcend actions. As we have seen, when I drop attachment to something, I transcend that. The standard example is when I was a child, I was attached to my toys.\n\nAnd as I grow, the attachment to those toys drop. You can't give a 12 year old a balloon on their birthday like you gave them at age three. With my little Maida, I can see the difference between what I could give her six months ago and now -- she's constantly changing, saying \"oh no, I don't want that. That's a baby's toy.\" Just six months ago she was playing with it, now she's outgrown it. So you transcend as you attach to higher and higher things.\n\nSo if you attach to the higher, then the lower drops off. When we attach to the activity, Tamas drops off. When I attach to the desireless activities, the desires drops off. And now I have to go beyond that. So the next two chapters. Chapter five makes a bridge between contemplation, the Dhyana and the yoga which is activity actions.\n\nSo therefore it's called Karma Sannyasa Yoga -- renouncing actions. The first few verses start with Arjuna's question. Now this confusion is not really anything unique. Even the most ardent students of Bhagavad Gita constantly get confused about the goal of life -- whether Sannyasa is good or Yoga is good. Let me clarify the two terms we have defined before: egoless action, giving up the sense of doership, is Sannyasa. If I give up the agency -- the \"I am the doer\" -- it's Sannyasa.\n\nBut if I give up the enjoyership -- that I am the enjoyer of the fruits of my actions -- then I am a Yogi. So Yoga requires Tyaga, giving up the fruits of actions. Sannyasa requires complete renunciation of myself as this limited being, as the doer. But this is not very clear to most of us. So Bhagavan puts this question in Arjuna's mouth, which we have all universally asked. Sanyasam Karmanam Krishna punar yogam Chasansashi Yat shreya etayoho ekam tanme bruhi sunis chitam. We go and ask this question all over.\n\nTell me one thing that I can practice. Don't confuse me with all this elaborate discussion about what is right and what is wrong. Just tell me should I go and do this or not? Sanyasam Karmanam Krishna punar yogam chasansi. You are praising Sannyasa because we have seen several verses in last four chapters which says offer everything to me, just do actions for me. All of that basically means I have to renounce actions.\n\nSo it says Sanyasam Karmana sansasi. You are praising renunciation of action, giving up actions at the same time. And also you are praising Yoga. You spent the whole chapter describing what Yoga is. So now you tell me what is good for me. Yat sreya ethayaha ekam tanmi bruhisoneshitam.\n\nDon't give me two options. As I told you before, options really create confusion. When I was in Nairobi to buy a car, I had to register your name, just like in India it used to be. I think they changed it since, but I'm talking about the 80s. In India also, to get a car you had to register yourself, and after two or three years your number comes. Nairobi was the same way.\n\nMy boss told me that Neil go and buy a new car. The company used to give me a car and an old car. I was so excited I went and told my friends. My boss told me buy a new car. They all started laughing. I said why are you guys laughing?\n\nHe said new car means next couple of years then you may get it. I said no, no no, I need it now. He said there is no way you're going to get a new car. You register then a number will come. But I was so determined I need a new car. My boss told me you can get a new car, I'm going to get it.\n\nSo I used all my influences -- told all my friends, all my networking contacts, all the business people I knew. They finally found one car from a remote-area agency where there was one car available. You know, they allocate quotas to different agencies, and in the remote area there was no one to buy cars, so it was available. We bought the car from the remote area and drove it back to Nairobi. And I was so proud that I got a car. There was not even a question of which car it is -- whatever it is! It was actually called the Ford Laser.\n\nNone of you may have ever heard here Ford Laser. It is actually Mazda Trivanti, made in Japan for Ford company. I didn't even ask them what does that mean. They actually told me it's actually Mazda but it's Ford. New car, that's all I need. And I was so proud and happy.\n\nAnd after about eight months we decided to come to United States. I had to sell the car. So my boss said, you go and sell the car. I said, are you sure? Yeah, you sell it to whoever there. I realized why he wanted me to have a new car.\n\nSelling a car fetches more money than what I paid for, because cars are scarce. Somebody has a new car, people are going to pay a premium. So I sold that car for probably one and a half times what I bought it for. The company made a profit on me in eight months. I used the car and gave a profit to it. Then I come here, and the very first week I realized I can't survive in this country without a car.\n\nSo I told my brother in law, we need to go and buy a car, let's go and register it. You don't need to register. I said when can we go and buy a car? He said, over the weekend we will go. I said are you sure that we're going to wait till the weekend? He said, yeah, yeah, that's right, over the weekend.\n\nThe weekend comes and he tells me, let's go. So we first go to one dealership -- a Ford dealership -- and there are cars as far as my eyes can see. And he said, you can take any car from here. I said, are you serious? Tell me which one I should take. He said, this is just one dealer. We're going to then go to Chrysler, then we will go to GM, and then we will go to all the Japanese cars.\n\nYou tell me which car to buy and I'll buy it. But I'm not used to this. If you don't have a choice, that's the best situation you are in. When I started my firm, I did not have too many choices -- that was the best situation. When I had choices, I could never decide. So Arjuna is in the same situation.\n\nHe said, with all these choices, can you tell me what is good for me? So at least now we know that Arjuna has come from not doing anything. He wanted to run away from his actions. He is now ready to do actions. He realized that doing right action is what is necessary here. But he does not know what the right action is.\n\nThat's where we are all. We all want to do right things in life. It's just that we sometimes don't know what the right thing is. Therefore now Bhagavan says, Sanyasaha, Karma Yogastha, Nistreyaha Sakarao Ubhav -- both Sannyasa and Karma Yoga are good. Both lead to Sreyas, the bliss which I'm seeking, the peace which I'm seeking in life constantly.\n\nIf I do this, then all my life will be peaceful -- that's what we think. And so I continue to work towards my goals, and in the process I actually create more agitations. As I told you before, probably in this class, when I started going to Chinmaya Mission many, many years ago -- since I was a teenager -- we took Bhajans, and there is one verse that comes: Baalahatavat Krida Sakthah, Taruna Hatawat Taruni Sakthaha, Bruddha Tawat Chinta Saktha. I never understood it fully. Bala Tawat Krida Saktha -- easy.\n\nWhen I was a little child I was engaged in toys, you know and plays. No problem understanding. I understood it clearly. Mine is a love marriage so I understood the Taruna Tawat part -- being engrossed in romance. I thought to myself, by the time I'm 50 and my son is 25, I should be completely at peace, right? Since I have only one son, all my family responsibilities will be over. So why this Vriddha Tava Chinta Saktha -- why would old age be filled with worry? I now understand -- at my age, my Sansar has grown so large since I was in my 20s that I have too many sources of Chinta.",
      "reflection": "Arjuna's question in verse 1 mirrors our own confusion: should I renounce actions or engage in them? Krishna's answer reveals a profound truth - both paths lead to the same goal, but Karma Yoga is more accessible for most of us. Today, notice when you feel torn between \"doing\" and \"not doing.\" Are you seeking to escape responsibility, or are you genuinely ready to transcend action? The true sannyasi described in verse 3 is one who \"neither hates nor desires\" and is \"free from the pairs of opposites.\" This freedom comes not from avoiding life, but from engaging fully without attachment.\n\nConsider this practice: Choose one routine task today - cooking, commuting, or working - and perform it with complete presence, without mentally labeling it as pleasant or unpleasant. When you notice yourself wishing the task were different, or congratulating yourself for doing it well, gently return to the action itself. Ask yourself: \"Can I do this without needing it to be over? Can I act without becoming the 'doer'?\" This is the essence of what Krishna calls Karma Yoga being superior - it transforms every moment into spiritual practice, preparing the mind for the deeper renunciation that comes naturally with purification."

      "commentary": "We completed chapter four and started discussing chapter five. Chapter four was Gnana Karma Sannyasa Yoga, Yoga of Liberation of actions in Knowledge. Now chapter five is called Karma Sannyasa Yoga, Yoga of Renunciation of Actions. Some of the books only title it Sannyasa Yoga -- basically, Yoga for renunciation or true renunciation. And the word \"true\" is very meaningful here, because renunciation can be of many types.\n\nAnd we have been discussing what is true renunciation. Chapters one and two give us the background and the insight into the nature of the self. Chapters three and four talked about Karma Yoga, Yoga of action. So our journey is from inertness, which is the true nature of this body. In Prakriti everything is inert, and our body is nothing but part of this Prakriti. So the very nature of our self is inert.\n\nGiven a choice, what we want to do is nothing. So what are you doing this weekend, Neil? And my answer is nothing. I really don't plan anything. The real joy is not doing anything. So that's our basic nature is inertia, inertness.\n\nSo inertia is our nature, and therefore the danger is that we may fall into tamas. The first quest is to whip yourself up into rajas, to start doing activity. You can't do activity unless there is motivation. What is the motivation? My desires, my goals. To acquire and accomplish -- that is the motivation. It is very, very important to have motivation.\n\nSo all my activities are driven by my motivation, which is desires. From inertia I have to go to desire-prompted activities. That's where I do things, accomplish, and achieve. But then I have to rise above those, because I realize that's not the end -- that's the means to go to the end. So the next goal is to have desireless activities, which is the Yoga. We have seen that Yoga is activity performed keeping the greater good in mind. The Yajnas -- twelve different types of Yajnas described in the last chapters -- are meant to prompt ourselves into a level of activity which will purify our mind and intellect.\n\nAnd why are we purifying our mind and intellect? To get to the next stage where we can realize who we are -- the self. So that's meditation, Dhyana, contemplating on your own self. It's a journey from inertia to realizing yourself. Chapters three and four prepared us for desireless activities, Yajna. As we said, the definition of Yajna is activity which I do for the greater good.\n\nKeeping the good of the entire society, the community, the cosmos, the universe, humanity in mind -- that is my Yajna. There are twelve different methods we have learned. Now, once I have learned the art of action, I have to go beyond actions. The next two chapters, five and six, focus on how to transcend actions. As we have seen, when I drop attachment to something, I transcend that. The standard example is when I was a child, I was attached to my toys.\n\nAnd as I grow, the attachment to those toys drop. You can't give a 12 year old a balloon on their birthday like you gave them at age three. With my little Maida, I can see the difference between what I could give her six months ago and now -- she's constantly changing, saying \"oh no, I don't want that. That's a baby's toy.\" Just six months ago she was playing with it, now she's outgrown it. So you transcend as you attach to higher and higher things.\n\nSo if you attach to the higher, then the lower drops off. When we attach to the activity, Tamas drops off. When I attach to the desireless activities, the desires drops off. And now I have to go beyond that. So the next two chapters. Chapter five makes a bridge between contemplation, the Dhyana and the yoga which is activity actions.\n\nSo therefore it's called Karma Sannyasa Yoga -- renouncing actions. The first few verses start with Arjuna's question. Now this confusion is not really anything unique. Even the most ardent students of Bhagavad Gita constantly get confused about the goal of life -- whether Sannyasa is good or Yoga is good. Let me clarify the two terms we have defined before: egoless action, giving up the sense of doership, is Sannyasa. If I give up the agency -- the \"I am the doer\" -- it's Sannyasa.\n\nBut if I give up the enjoyership -- that I am the enjoyer of the fruits of my actions -- then I am a Yogi. So Yoga requires Tyaga, giving up the fruits of actions. Sannyasa requires complete renunciation of myself as this limited being, as the doer. But this is not very clear to most of us. So Bhagavan puts this question in Arjuna's mouth, which we have all universally asked. Sanyasam Karmanam Krishna punar yogam Chasansashi Yat shreya etayoho ekam tanme bruhi sunis chitam. We go and ask this question all over.\n\nTell me one thing that I can practice. Don't confuse me with all this elaborate discussion about what is right and what is wrong. Just tell me should I go and do this or not? Sanyasam Karmanam Krishna punar yogam chasansi. You are praising Sannyasa because we have seen several verses in last four chapters which says offer everything to me, just do actions for me. All of that basically means I have to renounce actions.\n\nSo it says Sanyasam Karmana sansasi. You are praising renunciation of action, giving up actions at the same time. And also you are praising Yoga. You spent the whole chapter describing what Yoga is. So now you tell me what is good for me. Yat sreya ethayaha ekam tanmi bruhisoneshitam.\n\nDon't give me two options. As I told you before, options really create confusion. When I was in Nairobi to buy a car, I had to register your name, just like in India it used to be. I think they changed it since, but I'm talking about the 80s. In India also, to get a car you had to register yourself, and after two or three years your number comes. Nairobi was the same way.\n\nMy boss told me that Neil go and buy a new car. The company used to give me a car and an old car. I was so excited I went and told my friends. My boss told me buy a new car. They all started laughing. I said why are you guys laughing?\n\nHe said new car means next couple of years then you may get it. I said no, no no, I need it now. He said there is no way you're going to get a new car. You register then a number will come. But I was so determined I need a new car. My boss told me you can get a new car, I'm going to get it.\n\nSo I used all my influences -- told all my friends, all my networking contacts, all the business people I knew.

I used the car and gave a profit to it. Then I come here, and the very first week I realized I can't survive in this country without a car.\n\nSo I told my brother in law, we need to go and buy a car, let's go and register it. You don't need to register. I said when can we go and buy a car? He said, over the weekend we will go. I said are you sure that we're going to wait till the weekend? He said, yeah, yeah, that's right, over the weekend.\n\nThe weekend comes and he tells me, let's go. So we first go to one dealership -- a Ford dealership -- and there are cars as far as my eyes can see. And he said, you can take any car from here. I said, are you serious? Tell me which one I should take. He said, this is just one dealer. We're going to then go to Chrysler, then we will go to GM, and then we will go to all the Japanese cars.\n\nYou tell me which car to buy and I'll buy it. But I'm not used to this. If you don't have a choice, that's the best situation you are in. When I started my firm, I did not have too many choices -- that was the best situation. When I had choices, I could never decide. So Arjuna is in the same situation.\n\nHe said, with all these choices, can you tell me what is good for me? So at least now we know that Arjuna has come from not doing anything. He wanted to run away from his actions. He is now ready to do actions. He realized that doing right action is what is necessary here. But he does not know what the right action is.\n\nThat's where we are all. We all want to do right things in life. It's just that we sometimes don't know what the right thing is. Therefore now Bhagavan says, Sanyasaha, Karma Yogastha, Nistreyaha Sakarao Ubhav -- both Sannyasa and Karma Yoga are good. Both lead to Sreyas, the bliss which I'm seeking, the peace which I'm seeking in life constantly.\n\nIf I do this, then all my life will be peaceful -- that's what we think. And so I continue to work towards my goals, and in the process I actually create more agitations. As I told you before, probably in this class, when I started going to Chinmaya Mission many, many years ago -- since I was a teenager -- we took Bhajans, and there is one verse that comes: Baalahatavat Krida Sakthah, Taruna Hatawat Taruni Sakthaha, Bruddha Tawat Chinta Saktha.

Mine is a love marriage so I understood the Taruna Tawat part -- being engrossed in romance. I thought to myself, by the time I'm 50 and my son is 25, I should be completely at peace, right? Since I have only one son, all my family responsibilities will be over. So why this Vriddha Tava Chinta Saktha -- why would old age be filled with worry? I now understand -- at my age, my Sansar has grown so large since I was in my 20s that I have too many sources of Chinta.",
      "reflection": "Verse 4 delivers a striking rebuke: \"Only the unenlightened speak of wisdom and right action as separate, not the wise.\" How often do we create false divisions - spiritual life versus practical life, meditation versus work, sacred versus mundane? Krishna declares that one who truly establishes himself in either path gains the fruit of both. The division exists only in our confused minds. Verse 6 adds a crucial warning: \"Without concentration, renunciation is difficult\" - we cannot skip the preparation that Karma Yoga provides.\n\nToday, experiment with seeing your work as your spiritual practice and your spiritual practice as your work. When you sit to meditate, bring the same diligence you bring to important tasks. When you engage in daily responsibilities, bring the same awareness you cultivate in meditation. Ask yourself: \"Where am I creating artificial separations between the 'spiritual' and the 'worldly'?\" Notice if you postpone inner peace until retirement, vacation, or some future condition. The sage meditating on the Divine, as verse 6 describes, does not wait for perfect circumstances - he finds the Divine in every circumstance. Can you bring this unified vision to just one hour of your day?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter five, Karma Sannyasa Yoga, Yoga of True Renunciation. So the chapter opens with Arjuna's question, which one is better? You had been praising Sannyasa. At the same time you are asking me to engage in action. Both are reaching the same goal. Whether you start with Karma Yoga or a Sannyasa, it will take you to the goal which you are striving all your life, that is finding a permanent bliss.\n\nRight now, it seems my life is filled with agitations and unhappiness. No matter how hard I try, I can't get out of agitations. Even when I think I'm doing something with good intentions, it creates agitations. As the Rolling Stones say, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. We do think we are doing it with good intentions. We end up in a very uneasy situation.\n\nSo how do I get out of it? One side, I think if I continue working harder and harder, I'll get to the point where there will be bliss. That's our retirement plan, isn't it? I want to work hard and work hard so I can get to a blissful retirement. Or say, I'm so tired of this agitations and unhappiness, I should give up everything and not get involved in anything. That's typically what we go through in our life at various stages of our life.\n\nAnd that's basically Arjuna's question. Bhagavan said no -- intelligently engaging yourself in either Karma or renouncing Karma will get you the same goal. However, for you, Karma Yoga is clearly better. You are not at a state to renounce actions. As Swami says, I can only renounce something which I have. I can't renounce and say I have given up Hanover County.\n\nI don't own Hanover County. I can't renounce Hanover county. Or I give Hanover county donation to Chinmaya Mission can't happen. I have to have something to renounce. So if I have worked very hard in the field of my actions, then only I can retire from actions. If I never engage myself into actions, there is nothing to retire from.\n\nThe man who never worked in his life -- how can he retire? If you're not working Monday through Friday, there is no weekend. All seven days are weekend for you. So Bhagavan says the first thing is you have to engage yourself in actions. You start with Karma Yoga, apply yourself into actions. And you start out your actions in life first with desire-prompted actions: I want to achieve this, I want to accomplish this, I want to get this -- and that will get me to happiness.\n\nThen he realized that that's not getting me anywhere. Then started desire less actions. Bill Gates obviously started out with a lot of desires, built the biggest company, want to put PC on every home and build the largest company. And he did whatever is stuck to make the Microsoft the biggest company. Now what he's doing is desireless actions. He's giving up all the money he has earned.\n\nHe's engaging himself actively into his foundation to better people's lives. So I start out to get happiness through my desire-prompted actions. Then I graduate from desire-prompted actions to desireless actions. From desireless actions only can I graduate to agency-less action -- giving up the sense of \"I am the doer.\" Moving from selfish action to selfless action is a journey, and Karma Yoga is the means to achieve that.\n\nSo Bhagavan said that only the people who do not understand this journey will think that Karma Yoga is different from Sannyasa, or that Gnana Yoga is different from Karma Yoga. But one who establishes himself in one will get the result of both. Once I establish myself in Karma Yoga, my mind and intellect will purify and I will achieve that bliss. Likewise, when I realize that I'm not this limited being, that I am not the doer, then I'll achieve the same bliss. So Yat Sankhe Praapvyate Sthanam Tad Yogi API gamma te -- whatever is reached by the knowledge that I am not this limited being can also be achieved by performing Karma Yoga.\n\nSo the one who sees that this is the same path leading to the same goal -- Yapasyati Sapashyati -- such a person realizes what the true destination is. What is the true journey? Sanya Sastamaha Baha Dukham Aptama Yogatah. If I start renouncing things before achieving things, it's very painful. I haven't even gained anything -- how can I renounce anything?\n\nSo first step to make myself worthy of giving up. If I start giving up without achieving anything, I want to make a Donation of a million dollar. But I have only hundred thousand dollars in my bank. It's going to give me more pain. If I achieve the level well, I can start giving up. Bill Gates could not have given up his money before Microsoft was built, right?\n\nSo for one who wants to renounce before achieving anything, it's very painful. Therefore, don't start thinking about giving up actions before you accomplish actions. Yoga Yukta, Munihi Brahman Achiranadhi Gacha Diprama. Once you establish yourself in Karma Yoga -- which is selfless action, Niskama Karma -- moving from desire-prompted action to desireless action, it is very easy to give up after that. Then Sannyasa comes very naturally to us.\n\nSee, therefore, in the Varnashrama system, you start with Brahmacharya, which is the life of a student.\n\nThen Grihasthashram -- you have to engage yourself in activity, achieve things, produce things, do whatever it is to support society, your family, your community. Then Vanaprastham -- gradually retreat from all activity. Not suddenly, but gradually start giving up the powers to your juniors, your sons, whoever you consider. And then Sannyasa -- you have already taken yourself out of action to a point where it's very easy to exit. So you see, once you establish yourself in desireless actions, it is very easy to achieve that peace which you are looking for.\n\nYoga Yukto Visuddhatma, Vijitatma Jitendriyaha, Sarva Bhuttma Bhutatma Kurvanapi Na Lipyate.\n\nOnce I establish myself in desireless action and I want to take Sannyasa, that Sannyasa does not mean that I will not be acting in this world. Outside, I'll be working in the world. But now the actions don't bind me. Yoga Yukta -- once one has established himself in Karma Yoga and the art of action. When I was learning music, obviously it's so painful to do the Sa-Ra-Ga-Ma, the Sargam.\n\nOnce you establish in that, it's very easy. So once you master anything, it's very easy to perform that action. So to perform these actions in a right way, Bhagavan said is without desire. You perform the same action without desires. Right now it is very difficult for me. Because everything is prompted by my desire.\n\nI want to achieve this. So all this is creating agitations. Once I'm out of agitations then it is very easy for me to give up. So these are the qualifications Yoga Yuktah Once we established in how to perform actions. Visuddhaatma Vasudhatma. Your internal instrument is purified.\n\nMind and intellect is now purified. So it sees things as they are. And we are not polluted by my desires. Right now the reality is colored by my desire. If the market is going up, we are all very happy. And the interest rates are at zero level.\n\nGreat for a businessman. But the guy who is retired and relying on investment income -- he is suffering with a 0% interest rate for so long. For a person surviving on investment income, 0% interest is a disaster. For a person borrowing money to leverage his business, that's great. There's never been a better time in this country than the last few years. So it's all colored by my desire.\n\nBut the one who is not involved in both, he sees that as a normal occurring. This is how the world works and there's nothing to rejoice or regret about it. Vijay Tatma who has a control over his self in this case is ego. Who has a control over his ego. He knows that these things are happening. I'm just doing my part.\n\nJit Indriyaha -- one who has control over the senses. Indriyas are there for a purpose and they have their own reasons to be there. And I have control over what I see, what I hear, what I touch, what I taste. I have control over it, not my senses.\n\nSarva Bhuttma Bhuttatma -- now this is the real test of a Sannyasi. Once he starts seeing that the self in me is the self in all beings.\n\nMyself and yourself and his self or herself are not various selves. One self manifesting as me, you, he, she, it. When that reason comes, Bhagavan says Kurvan API na lipya dhai. He can do whatever he wants in this world but not affected by it. We are affected by our actions because we think I've done good, that means I'm going to get something out of it. I've done bad, I'm going to get punished by it.\n\nAll these things are because of my desires. But once I have transcended the desires -- see, when two children are playing and both are your children, who wins and who loses is not a problem. Serena Williams and Venus Williams -- at one time they were both in a Wimbledon final. To their father, what does it matter which daughter is going to win?\n\nGuaranteed, he is happy either way -- otherwise he is jumping up and down in his chair. Whether his daughter is going to win or not, if I start seeing myself in everything, then whoever is winning or losing is all me winning and me losing. Therefore, Bhagavan always says, you are not suffering alone -- I'm suffering with you. When I suffer, he suffers at the same time. You know, different Puranas say that somebody did this or Bhagavan had the pain. It's symbolic.\n\nBut if I pervade everywhere in my dream, even the one who is suffering and one who is enjoying, both are me. So Bhagavan said, when I start seeing that Kurvanna pina Lipyade, then whatever I do is not affecting me. So the following three verses say the attitude of a person who has achieved that level of accomplishment and seeing things as one. How that Sanyasi so is now a realized person. He has seen that the one self pervades everywhere and I am no different than it. His attitude will be Naiva kinship, Karomi Ithi, Yuktah, manyya tattvavit.\n\nHere is the qualification or the description of a self-realized master -- Tattvavit -- who knows in essence what the reality is all about. There is no plurality as we see it. The perception of plurality is because I have confined myself to this limited identification. I am one person when I identify this body as me. But when I represent a family or a company -- when I say I'm from Google -- I represent Google.\n\nThe entire Google pervades in me. The whole power of that company I exude when I say I am from Google. I remember I used to work for large companies. So when I go to Austria or someplace, I'm not Neil Bart. I'm representing wzmh, one of the largest companies. When I take out my card and say I'm Neil Bart, wzmh.\n\nI'm not presenting my qualifications -- I'm presenting the qualifications of my company. Then I left the company, started NBJ architecture with four people. Now I have to say I am who I am. It changes your perception when you expand your identification. So one who has expanded his identification to the entire universe -- for him, Naiva kinchit karomi, \"I am not doing anything.\"",
      "reflection": "These three verses paint a remarkable portrait of the liberated soul in action. Verse 7 describes one who has \"realized his highest Self as the Self of all\" - and crucially, \"even though he acts, is not bound by his acts.\" Verses 8 and 9 then enumerate the full range of human activities - seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, moving, sleeping, breathing, talking, giving, receiving, even opening and closing the eyes - and declare that the wise one knows \"it is not he who acts.\" This is not philosophical theory but a lived experience: the recognition that \"his senses are merely disporting themselves among the objects of perception.\"\n\nPractice this contemplation today: As you go through your activities, periodically pause and observe. Who is seeing? Who is hearing? Notice that the eyes see automatically, the ears hear automatically - you, the awareness behind it all, are simply witnessing. When eating lunch, notice that taste happens, chewing happens, swallowing happens. Can you locate the \"doer\"? This is the attitude of the tattvavit, the knower of Truth mentioned in verse 8. The goal is not to become passive or disconnected, but to recognize your true position as the unchanging witness while the body-mind instrument continues its natural functions. Even now, as you read these words, who is reading? Abide as that which knows."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter five, Karma Sannyasa Yoga, Yoga of Renunciation of Actions. So far we have learnt in Bhagavad Gita that the self which I consider myself is not the real self. We learnt in chapter two, Sankhya Yoga. So the entire quest in our life is to reconcile this paradox we have. We consider ourselves to be a limited being. But Bhagavad Gita says, you are not the limited being.\n\nSo how do I remove this paradox? How do I change this paradigm with which I'm functioning right now as an individual limited being, and identify with that unlimited supreme being? That's basically the goal of the rest of the teachings of Bhagavad Gita. So in chapter three, Bhagavan said, you can start with Karma Yoga, Yoga of Action. Act you must, but act in a way that does not bind you, so that you can free yourself from this conditioning. You act in this world without an expectation for the fruits, because you are not in control of the fruits.\n\nRight now I consider myself to be completely separate from this world, and I'm competing with this world. Bhagavan said, unless you give up this identity of your own, you will not be able to realize your true identity. The Upanishads tell us that the world which I see is finite, but that supreme is unlimited, infinite, Almighty, all-knowing. But for me to perceive that is very, very difficult. So therefore we chant this: Om Purnamadhah Purnamidam Purnath Purnamuddhachate Purnasya Purnamadaya Purnamavashate. It says that from that infinite came this infinite which I see as infinite.\n\nJagat, this Prakriti, is also complete and infinite. That from which it came, the supreme Brahman, is also infinite. That is infinite. This is also infinite. The world I'm identifying with is also infinite, even though it seems finite. Even though I see myself as a finite being in a world that appears finite -- it's not finite, it's infinite. And if you take this infinite out of that infinite, what remains is still infinite.\n\nIn other words, there is no separation between the world which I perceive and the real self. There is no separation between my limited self and that supreme self. But ignorance is creating this dual vision, and I need to remove that. So the first step is: when you act in this world, see this unity and don't expect any results from your actions. That will relieve you from the anxiety of the fruits of actions. And then chapter four said there are not really two separate entities. Both came from the same singular entity, and therefore act for the betterment of the entire Jagat.\n\nThe Jagat that you consider your own world -- maybe your own family, maybe your own community, maybe your own nation. Work for that without expecting that your actions will bear particular results; that will free you from anxiety. And now in this chapter, we are learning how to renounce this sense of agency -- that \"I am the doer.\"\n\nSo Bhagavan started this chapter saying you can reach that same goal by renouncing actions and also by performing actions. Renouncing actions in the knowledge that I am not the doer will take you to that place where you can identify with your supreme self. But performing actions in this world without any expectations will also lead you to that state, by purifying your internal instrument, which right now is conditioned by this limitedness that you have taken upon yourself as your own.\n\nBhagavan said both are one and the same. Yatsangkhi prapyate sthanam tadyogi apigema. That place which is reached by contemplation on the very fact we learnt in chapter two -- that I am not this mortal being, I am that immortal being. If I contemplate on that statement and come to the conclusion that that's the truth, I change my identification from this limited self to the higher self. That's the path of Sankhya -- contemplating on that great statement Tattvamasi, \"you are that.\" But if that's not in my capability right now, Bhagavan said, tat yoge API gammade.\n\nBy performing this Karma Yoga, you can also achieve that same state, the same result. And therefore you should start with Karma Yoga. Because contemplation without preparing your mind for the contemplation is pretty painful. In other words, it will not bear any good result. And then you will be frustrated. And then you will say, I don't think this has any value.\n\nSo rather than engaging yourself in Something you're not capable of, engage yourself in purifying your mind and intellect. The yogi who has achieved the state of purification, he knows that naiva kinchit karomi ITI yuktaham manyate tattvavit. One who knows the essence of the self, that that which feels like my limited self is nothing but the supreme self. It is my own ignorance that I'm identifying with the limitations and therefore I feel limited. One who has recognized that truth by establishing himself in yoga or by contemplation, he knows that naivakinchitkarami I am not doing anything. Everything is performed by indriyani indriyarthesu vartanta ITI dharayan.\n\nHe clearly sees that what I perceive as activity performed by me is nothing but senses reacting with sense objects. And we can clearly see through our normal observations that my sense of taste will indulge me into eating more sweets, and that will show up on my body. So it is the sense objects and senses reacting with each other. Or I may consider myself to be a very wise person with control over my intellect and mind, but just one substance from this world called alcohol -- if I indulge in it, all my wisdom and sanity will go away and I will act like an average idiot.\n\nSo we know that these sense objects have clear effect on my behavior, a clear effect on how I think. And therefore I have to come to the conclusion that indriyaani indriya teshu vartnantah, the senses are indulging in activity with the sense objects. So all the activities, all that which is good and how that is bad is nothing but purely the interaction between the senses and sense objects. And we have seen sabdas parsa rupa rasa gandha, the five sense objects, and kshutra thvaka chakshuhu rasana grana, the five senses we have, you remove one, then the world of that sense will go away. If you remove all five, the world of objects which I perceive will go away. So therefore Bhagavan says, Brahmani adhaya karmani sangam tyaktva karotiyah.\n\nSo now, I am not at the level of that Yogi who clearly sees \"naiva kinchit karomi\" -- I am not doing anything. He does not have this confusion that I have. I think \"I am doing this, I have done this, I have not done this\" -- he does not have that confusion. He is like the ocean which sees its own waves and sees that he, as the ocean, is not involved in the activities of the waves. The waves are the water reacting with the wind, creating these waves on the surface.\n\nBut at the bottom, the ocean is standing still. They say Brahmani Adhaya Karmani Sangam Tyaktva Karutiyah. The phrase \"Sangam Tyaktva\" comes, as Sid pointed out last time, in this verse, and then \"Karma Phalam Tyaktva\" in the third verse. This word \"Tyaktva\" is constantly coming in our discussion. Anytime we see the word Tyaktva, it clearly means we are already attached. It means \"give up, abandon.\"\n\nI can only do that if I have something which I have to give up. So this clearly says that Sangam Tyaktva I am already attached. It's given that I'm attached to this world. I'm attached to this body, I'm attached to this mind, I'm attached to my intellect. No matter how hard I try, I keep identifying with who I am. As this limited being.\n\nThe idea that I am the doer does not go away very easily. Therefore, Bhagavan said, there is a method to get rid of that. Your mind has a tendency to attach, and if you don't give it an alternate, you will never be able to give up your attachment. So the alternate: Brahmani Yadhaya Karmani -- you offer all your actions to that supreme. That supreme which is complete. There is no place for you to be there as an individual.\n\nIf that supreme is all-pervading, all-complete -- if I'm all-pervading in my chair, there's no place for somebody else to be here. If that supreme is all-pervading, there is no place for me as a little ego to be there. And therefore, offer all your actions to that supreme. Brahmani Yadhaya Karmani, Sangam Tyaktva -- first you have to detach yourself from this attachment.\n\nSo by attaching yourself to Brahman, you offer all actions to him. Right now I'm bound by all my actions. I get success and I get elated. I get failure and I get dejected. When I get dejected and disappointed, it creates a negative impression in my mind -- that is the sin I'm incurring. So now the exercise for you, Bhagavan said, is this: because you are not at that level of a Yogi, you offer all your actions to him. Continue working, but think that you are not working for yourself -- you are working for him.\n\nWhatever the results come, that will be his loss or profit, not yours. This analogy comes in our scriptures all the time. Just as lotus leaf is in the water, but does not get moistened by the water, it comes out of water, goes back into the water, decays in water, but during its lifetime it never gets moistened by the water. The same way you came in this world, you live in this world. You will die in this world. But while living, you don't get attached to the world by attaching yourself to Brahman.\n\nSo here is the technique Bhagavan has given for giving up the sense of agency, for those of us who are still at a level where we think that we are the doers. Kayana, Manasa, Buddhaya, Kaivalay, Indriyahiyapi, Yogi nahakarma, Karvanti, Sangam tyaktva atma sudaye. Again the words \"Sangam Tyaktva\" -- by giving up attachment, because right now I am attached. That fact has to be acknowledged first, and then we can say what is my next step. It is like Alcoholics Anonymous.\n\nThe first step is to admit that I'm an alcoholic. See, the first step is to admit that I am attached to this world -- to my body, my mind, my intellect, and my senses. Therefore, now I should recognize that I am not the one instigating all these activities. The activities are done by my body, because the very nature of the body is to function. Manasa -- by my mind, because the very nature of mind is to go out and get attached. Buddha -- my intellect, because the very nature of my intellect is to think what is right, what is wrong, what I have experienced, what I have not experienced. And my senses -- the very nature of the senses is to go out and get impressions from the world outside. Those impressions, now reported to the mind, create impressions on the mind.\n\nThose impressions on the mind create perceptions in my intellect, and then I become the doer of the activity. But once I detach myself from all of this -- Kaya, Mana, Buddhi, and Indriya -- they are independent of me. They are acting according to their own nature. But I, the consciousness, the self, am not involved in it. Yogi Naha, Karma, Kurvanti, Sangam tyaktva atma sudaye.\n\nSo here clearly Bhagavan gives us the goal. The goal is the purification of the internal instrument Atma.",
      "reflection": "The lotus leaf analogy in verse 10 offers a powerful image for daily life: living in the world without being stained by it, just as the lotus remains in water yet never gets wet. Verse 11 reveals the purpose of this detached engagement - \"atmasuddhaye,\" for the purification of the self. This is not passive withdrawal but active purification. Verse 12 then presents the clear choice: one who abandons the fruit of action \"wins eternal peace,\" while one driven by desire \"becomes entangled.\"\n\nToday, offer your actions to the Spirit as verse 10 instructs. Before beginning any task, silently acknowledge: \"This action is offered to the Divine. The results belong to the Divine.\" Notice how this shifts your relationship with the work. The recurring phrase \"sangam tyaktva\" (giving up attachment) appears twice in these verses - acknowledge that you are currently attached, and that is precisely why this practice is necessary. Like Alcoholics Anonymous begins with admitting the problem, spiritual growth begins with acknowledging our attachments. Track your inner state during one significant activity today: Are you performing it for purification (atmasuddhaye) or for personal gain? The quality of your inner peace will reveal the answer. Can you be like the lotus - fully present in your environment yet untouched by its turbulence?"

      "commentary": "So now we know that in my life, actions are necessary, but they're also my assets. My actions are my assets. Well, Neil, how did you accomplish what you accomplished? All that I have done -- went to architecture school, then worked for all these years for very little pay. My actions are my assets, but my actions are also a liability. So my actions are both the assets and the liabilities.\n\nAnd what we try to do is leverage the assets and renounce the liabilities. When you file bankruptcy, what are you trying to do? You're renouncing your liabilities. But at the same token, you have to renounce your assets as well. You know, a very good recent example -- HDL, a very well-respected, fastest-growing company, thousands of employees and millions of dollars of investment. They filed for bankruptcy. Not only their bad deeds and their debt they have renounced, but the assets also they had to renounce -- just got sold for like 32 or 37 million dollars.\n\nThere were probably hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of investment. Bhagavan said that when you file bankruptcy on your liabilities, you have to also renounce your assets. So if I give up this sense of agency for both my good actions and bad actions, then I'm free. No assets, no liability.\n\nSo Bhagavan said that one who takes the doership has to suffer through the merits or the sins of his actions. The Yogi, while working, realizes that he can't give up the agency, but he gives up the fruits of actions.\n\nWhatever will come out, I'll accept. Because I'm not the Karma-Phaladatta -- I'm the actor. I have the capacity to act, empowered by the Lord as my consciousness. But I have no control over what comes out from the world. The world is the Karma-Phaladatta. When I practice architecture, all the efforts I put in -- I can't give myself a project.\n\nSomebody else has to give me a project. So the Karma-Phaladatta is somebody other than myself. Now in our Puranic sense, we think that the Karma-Phaladatta is Bhagavan -- that Bhagavan is keeping score of what good deeds you have done, what bad deeds you have done. Therefore, when we go to the temple, what do we ask for? Bhagavan, maaf karna. Bhagavan, Bhagavan hoge.\n\nWe don't say, \"You remember what good deeds I have done -- I'm in control, don't worry about it, Mr. Bhagavan.\" Just \"Bhagavan, maaf karna.\" So whenever we are in trouble, we ask Bhagavan to forgive us for all of our bad actions. But when it comes to success -- \"I'm a self-made man. Came to this country with $8 in my pocket.\"\n\nWhen I left India, the only thing I could take with me was $8. That was the total foreign exchange the Indian government allowed for people who leave India. So most of us came with $8 in our pocket. Your problems, Bhagavan -- you take care of it. But Bhagavan said, look, neither can I take care of your problems, nor can I give you credit for what you have done. Because all these actions which you are performing are in the realm of Prakriti.\n\nNot in the realm of the self. Bhagavan is functioning in the realm of the self. So the verse which we will be seeing today says Nakartrutvam nakarmani lokasya srajati prabhuhu. This is completely in contrast to what we have believed all along -- that Bhagavan is the controller of all that I do. See, every time I make a mistake, I just say, what can I do?\n\nBhagavan has made me like that. Bhagavan put me in this situation. And that's a good comforting thought. That look, I'm not doing anything wrong. Bhagawan is putting me in this situation. And also we have this Puranic idea that Chitragupta is writing this book.\n\nWhen you die he will just open up your account and say look, what good deeds you did. What bad deeds you did. Well, looks like your balance is pretty good. Well, it looks like your account on the negative side so it will go to hell. So we thought that somebody is taking care of all these things. So we always have this comfort zone that Bhagavan is actively participating in my life and he is guiding me or he is maneuvering me to what I am doing.\n\nBut now this Verse says Bhagavan says, I'm not doing anything. Nakartrutvam Nakarmani not the doership or the actions are created in this world by Prabhu. One who is a Prabha is a Prabhu. The Lord, one on which my life depends, is my Lord. The Lord is the one who sustains my livelihood. So my Lord is the one on whom my life depends.\n\nSo he's the Lord of my being, my consciousness. As long as I'm alive, I am who I am. As soon as the consciousness leaves me, I'm no longer who I am. That dead body -- you won't call it Neil Bhat. You will get rid of it as quickly as you can. Because I am who I am because of the consciousness in me.\n\nSo here Bhagavan says, Nakaratrutvam Nakarmani -- nothing in this world is created by the Lord of your being, my consciousness. The self which I call myself, you call yourself, he calls himself, she calls herself -- it is not forcing you to do anything. It's not creating any actions for you. It's also not creating any sense of agency for you. It's not taking any part in anything which you're doing.\n\nThen where does this idea of me doing things come from?\n\nIt comes from your identification with the conditioning of yourself. Navadvare puree dehi naiva kinchit karomi iti -- the verse says it is the embodied one in this nine gated city who thinks \"I am doing.\" The self says, \"I am not doing anything.\" But the one who identifies with this nine gated city becomes the doer. And that identifier is my ego that says this is me.\n\nThe ego is the doer because he is the identifier with the conditioning. So Bhagavan said, the self, I, the Lord of your being is not forcing you to do anything nor am I creating any actions for you. He's also not the one who is actively sitting down with his supercomputer and saying Neil did this. He's completely out of this business. He simply says, let nature take care of it. Everything that is happening to me is happening because of the way I acted according to my nature -- the nature of my body, the nature of my mind, the nature of my intellect -- and then the nature of the world, what object I have acted upon, and at what level of physical abilities.\n\nIf I punch a guy who is 6'5\" and about 300 pounds, what do you think the reaction would be? According to his Prakriti, according to my Prakriti -- Svabhavastu Pravartate. So Bhagavan said, in this world, actions are performed by the very nature of the beings -- the very nature of my body, mind, and intellect. And the Karma Phala coming to me is also dependent on the nature of the world. I always say, I may be the best architect on this planet, but if there is no work outside, no matter how much effort I put in, will there be any result?\n\nBecause the world is completely devoid of that need. But if I put my effort into a field where there is a need compatible with my ability, then I will get results. So what is happening? The Karma and Karma Phala are not dependent on whether Bhagavan thinks I'm a good guy or a bad guy. \"Well, give Neel some projects.\"\n\nHe takes Gita class on Sundays. My clients don't care whether I take Gita class or Bible class. They only care whether I can design their buildings effectively. So Svabhavastu Pravartate -- everything in this world is guided by the laws of nature. Bhagavan says, I as the Prabhu am not involved at all.\n\nSo please don't count on me. This is a big shocker for all of us. We always thought that no matter what bad I did, as long as I go to the temple, the coconuts I offer will take care of it. So Bhagavan said, I do not take part in any of that. Na Adatte Kasyachit Papam -- I do not take sins from anybody.\n\nNo matter what bad I do, Bhagavan says, it does not affect me at all. Na chaiva Sukritam Vibhuhu -- and also I don't accept any good deeds. \"Aap khud hi karaho, Bhagavan, you don't do anything for me.\" I don't accept anything.\n\nI don't accept any of your good deeds or bad deeds. That self which is all-pervading is not affected by any good deeds or bad deeds in this universe. Myself, my consciousness, which I consider my Prabhu -- because I cannot sustain myself without him -- the same self is also Vibhu, all-pervading. So right now I'm burdened by my sins.\n\nIn a sense I'm burdened by what things I have done wrong in my life. I wish I had done this. I wish I had done this. I wish I had not put money in the market before it crashed. I wish I had bought Apple stock when it came out 25 years ago or whatever. But one said, but it's not affecting me.\n\nThe self in me is not tainted by my sins, my bad deeds, or my good merits. So with all the good deeds and bad deeds happening in this world, we constantly ask this question: Why does Bhagavan let this happen? What is this ISIS doing? And tsunami, and all these terrorists, and all these things happening.\n\nIs he sleeping at the wheel? He said, no, I really have nothing to do with it. Everything is happening as per the nature of the Prakriti. Once I have created the Prakriti, it is governed by its own laws. We know the laws -- Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas.\n\nThese laws, in their permutations and combinations, create this world of plurality. The world of plurality interacts with itself according to its own gunas and creates its own results. But I stay out of it. Once you create the laws of the game, the referee only judges the player based on the rules of the game -- not whether he thinks someone is a nice guy or a bad person. You have to play by the rules of the game.\n\nOnce I sit in my car and turn the ignition, the car does not know whether a nice person has turned the ignition or a bad person. It will go by how the laws of thermodynamics work in the engine. So Bhagavan says, I do not really accept any good deeds or bad deeds. Then why are we not seeing this? Why are we not seeing that all these things happening are very natural -- that they are happening exactly as they should? The world is perfect, as Dan used to say all the time.\n\nThe world as is is the way it should be. But I constantly think this world is not appropriate. I don't know why everything is so messed up. You know, it's a chaos. But once I know it's not a chaos, it's the cosmos, it's not a chaos. Things are exactly happening in your life as it should happen.\n\nBecause of what you did so far, things will happen in your future exactly as you build your future. But then I am completely confused about these laws of the game. I'm actually participating in a game without knowing the rules of the game. Basically, that's the problem. If I start playing football without knowing what the rules are, I'm going to be crushed. That's exactly what is happening with me right now.\n\nSo Bhagawan says, why that is happening? Agnane Abrutam Gnanam this knowledge about the self is covered by the ignorance.",
      "reflection": "Verse 13 introduces the striking image of the body as a \"city of nine gates\" - the two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, mouth, and two lower openings. The self-controlled soul \"enjoys bliss\" dwelling within this city, \"neither doing anything himself nor causing anything to be done.\" Verses 14-15 deliver perhaps the most challenging teaching: the Lord does not create our sense of doership, does not ordain our actions, and does not accept responsibility for our sins or merits. \"All this is the work of Nature.\" Our confusion arises because \"wisdom is submerged in ignorance.\"\n\nThis teaching demands deep reflection. We habitually blame God when things go wrong and take credit when things go right. Today, examine this pattern in yourself. When you succeed, notice the thought \"I did this.\" When you fail, notice the tendency to blame circumstances, others, or even the Divine. Verse 14 states clearly: \"svabhavastu pravartate\" - it is your own nature, the interplay of body, mind, intellect with the world, that creates results. The Lord is like the sun - it enables all activity without participating in it, without preference for what grows in its light. Can you take full responsibility for your life while simultaneously releasing the ego that claims ownership? Sit with this paradox today: everything is happening according to natural law, yet you are not excused from the consequences of your actions. How does this understanding change your relationship with your choices?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter five, Karma Sannyasa Yoga. So far we have seen that Bhagavan said Karma Yoga is clearly better for you, because Sannyasa may be more difficult to pursue for one who has not developed the quality of na dveshti na kankshati -- who does not hate or does not even desire. For such a person, Sannyasa is not really easy to practice.\n\nTherefore, Karma Yoga -- Yoga Yukta Bhava, become Yoga Yukta. Yoga Yukta Bhava is to develop the art of performing actions for the greater good, not for myself. And the technique given to us in this chapter says: while you are performing all your actions, constantly think that you are not doing anything. Pralapan, vishrujan, srunan, svashan -- even when you are breathing, seeing, hearing, touching, think that you are not doing that. Someone other than what you think you are is doing it.\n\nSo that's the technique given to us: constantly, while I'm acting in this world, I should see that something else is doing it. What is that something else? Well, we can clearly identify that everything we do is either my body doing it, my mind doing it, or my intellect doing it. The observer who is observing this activity is someone other than body, mind, and intellect. So constantly see yourself as the witness of your own activity. Just as when we witness other people and say, \"I know he's doing well, he's not doing well, I think he's wrong or he's right\" -- but we are not involved in it. We are constantly judging other people from our vantage point, our perspective.\n\nIf we start developing a practice where we can do the same thing for ourselves, we will clearly see what is right and wrong for us. When we do something wrong, if we step out of that activity and see it, we'll see whether that was right or wrong, and the next time we can correct it. So the technique is given to us: constantly watch yourself as a third-party observer in all the activities you do.\n\nAnd then the last few verses we had been discussing, where Bhagavan comes out and says Nakartrutvam lokasya Prabhu -- the Lord is not creating any sense of doership.\n\nThe ego which I have right now saying this is me and I am the doer. I am the enjoyer and I am the sufferer. Bhagawan said, I really have nothing to do with it. So please don't blame me. I did not create this ego for you. It is the very part of the Prakriti that these activities are going on.\n\nYour body, mind and intellect are nothing but part of the Prakriti. You identifying it created this ego. But I am not the creator of your ego. You now have the responsibility to get rid of the ego yourself. Nakartruttam na karmanis Lokas. The Lord who is the Lord of my being is not responsible or not the creator of this ego.\n\nThat sense of \"this is me, that's not me, nobody else could have done it without me, this cannot function without me\" -- Bhagavan said, I'm not putting that in your head. I'm not creating this sense of agency, nor am I creating any actions. In other words, the Lord of my being is beyond the world of activity.\n\nAnd we know this world of activity -- at the Prakriti level. Activity is taking place at the level of Prakriti, this world of plurality, the world where I exist and you exist and the world exists. For any activity to take place, you need two things.\n\nWhen there is an actor and an object of activity, then only does activity take place. If there is no duality, no activity takes place. That's why when you are alone, you get bored. By myself, what can I do? I need somebody to play with. That's why solitude is so difficult for us to practice.\n\nWe want a life where everything is going on. But Bhagavan said, in reality there is no duality when it comes down to the core of your being -- yourself, myself, his self, and her self are one. So at that level, no activity is ever taking place. Therefore he says, I am beyond this activity. I am not creating doership, and I am not creating actions.\n\nWe constantly blame Bhagavan for things not going right for us. When things go right, \"I put all the efforts and got it.\" When things go wrong, \"Bhagavan is not looking after me these days.\" He said, I am completely away from your activity. I am not in the business of marrying your actions with the fruits of actions.\n\nI'm not taking stock about what Papa I had done or Punya I had done. It's entirely up to you and the world you're working in to figure out the transactions and what is the results of the transactions. Because I created this Prakriti out of my own self by my Maya. In the previous chapter we have seen it clearly stated that I am working in this world out of my own Maya. Ajo'pi san avyayatma bhutanam ishwaro'pi san prakritim swam adhishthaya sambhavami atma-mayaya -- by my own Maya, by presiding over this Prakriti, I work in this world.\n\nSo once I created the Prakriti out of my own Maya from the Bhagavan's perspective, my work is done. I created the field of activity, the rules of the activity, the laws of nature. And we had been saying many, many times in this discussion that the laws of nature are without any exception. They apply to all of us in the Prakriti equally. It does not see that because I have done this many punyas that my papa gets wiped out. It's not a canceling each other type of activity.\n\nYou do one good, you're forgiven one bad? No. You pay for your bad and you get reward for your good. That's the rules of the game. So, one, I am a part of the Prakriti. I'm going through my life within the laws of the Prakriti. As long as I am abiding by the rules of the Prakriti, I'll be evolving in the Prakriti.\n\nThe whole game -- the Bhagavant Leela, Krishna Leela as we call it -- starts out with being the ignorant self, not knowing who I am. That's the original sin. When I forgot who I am, that is the original sin -- Avidya. From that Avidya, through my own evolutionary efforts, I evolve. When I was just a single-cell amoeba, I evolved at the lap of Mother Nature. Then I became a human being.\n\nAnd now I have to evolve with my own efforts. With this evolution, I have to get out of this identification with this body, mind and intellect to identify with the self where the game started when the Avidya started. And I have to get out of the Avidya and become Vidya again. While I'm at the Prakriti level, I still have a responsibility and activity to Perform. So in chapter three, we are given the rules of the game. If you really want to evolve in this Prakriti act for the greater good.\n\nAll your activities must be for the greater good -- for the Yajna spirit, not for you as this self, this body, mind, and intellect, but for the greater good. By acting for this greater good, I will rise above this selfish ego and purify my mind and intellect. Now, we have been given free will. And therefore, at times we will be acting in line with Dharma, and at times against Dharma. This chapter says, I am not taking any part in your activity.\n\nIt's done as per the rules of the games. When I put the key in the ignition of my car, there is no discrimination for BMW to decide whether I'm a nice guy or a bad guy, whether I'm the owner of the car or the thief who is stealing this BMW. It would work exactly as the laws of thermodynamics and electricity are in this nature. It will start the car as long as I have the right key. So you see, if he's not taking part, then who is maintaining the laws in this nature? If there are laws in this nature, there got to be law giver and law enforcer.\n\nWithout a law enforcer, no law is of any value. Because there is law enforcement, the laws are abided by. In this country or anywhere else in this world, we see the laws are very precisely followed in nature. So there has got to be a law enforcer. And if he says I'm not taking part, who is enforcing the law? Bhagavan says, that's also me.\n\nAs part of my lower nature as a Prakriti, I control the laws of Prakriti. And therefore anytime in a society when majority of the people are not following these laws, I have to take charge again and set those rules visible again for everybody, clarify the situation and make those laws again visible to people to follow. So all the bad elements are weeded out. Dharma is re established. His job as a law enforcer is to make sure that in the Prakriti laws are followed. And therefore Prakriti continues to function as it is designed.\n\nPrakriti is a self regulating entity and therefore Prakriti itself will create its own enforcement and clarification. The verse we saw in chapter four seems like a direct contradiction to this verse. It says whenever there is a decay of Dharma -- but actually Dharma itself is not decaying. Rather, people are not following Dharma. When people are not following Dharma, then \"yadaa yadaa hi dharmasya glaanir bhavati... tadatmanam srijamy aham\" -- I manifest myself to get rid of the Adharma, to restore those who are not following Dharma.\n\nSo how does that work? It's not at an individual level. Bhagavan doesn't come down and say, \"You're a bad guy, I'm going to eliminate you. You're a good guy, I'm going to help you.\" It's like the federal government.\n\nWe have this Federal Reserve Bank. This sets the monetary policy. They don't come and call me and say, neil, so what's happening in your company? You think you need some help? Can we do something with the interest rate so NBG architecture can function better? Or let me call you a next door guy, whether he's doing okay.\n\nWhat they look at is the country. Are we doing well as a country? Well, then I don't have to do much -- raise the interest rate, whatever is appropriate. We're not doing well? They have to come down and say, we're going to lower the interest rates. And at one point it was practically zero or something like that.\n\nBut it's not at an individual level. At the national level, at the global level, Bhagavan said, I see -- Yada yada hi Dharmasya glanir bhavati. When I see that overall the Dharma is decaying -- take the green building movement. We saw that Dharma is decaying on this planet. We are constantly emitting carbon dioxide. We are depleting the ozone layer.\n\nSo Bhagavan manifests himself through organizations like USGBC, the United States Green Building Council. Now there is an awareness that we need to be working towards sustainable energy, sustainable design, preserving this planet. Anytime there's a decay of Dharma in this global society, this awareness gets created again to reestablish Dharma. But at the individual level, my actions and the rewards of my actions are determined by the nature of my actions, the nature of this world, and the nature of the field in which I act. At that level I have to rely on the laws of society, the laws of nature, laws of the community.",
      "reflection": "Verse 16 uses the powerful image of the sun: \"Surely wisdom is like the sun, revealing the supreme truth.\" Just as the sun does not create light but simply is light, wisdom does not create the Self but reveals what was always present, hidden by ignorance. Verse 17 describes those who meditate on the Divine going \"whence there is no return\" - their sins \"dissolved in wisdom.\" Most remarkably, verse 18 declares that sages \"look equally upon all\" - whether a learned Brahmin, a cow, an elephant, a dog, or an outcaste. This sama-darshana (equal vision) is the hallmark of realization.\n\nToday, practice sama-darshana consciously. As you encounter different people - colleagues, service workers, family members, strangers - can you perceive the same consciousness animating each form? The verse deliberately contrasts extremes: the highest (learned Brahmin) with the lowest (outcaste), the large (elephant) with the small (dog). This is not about ignoring differences at the practical level but about recognizing the same Self wearing different costumes. When someone irritates you today, pause and remember: the same awareness that looks out through your eyes is looking out through theirs. When you admire someone, remember: that same light shines in the person you find difficult. This practice of \"equal seeing\" is not sentimental but precise - it targets the root of our judgments and preferences. Can you maintain this vision for even five minutes continuously?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter five, Karma Sannyasa Yoga. So far we have seen that Bhagavan said Karma Yoga is clearly better for you, because Sannyasa may be more difficult to pursue for one who has not developed the quality of na dveshti na kankshati -- who does not hate or does not even desire. For such a person, Sannyasa is not really easy to practice.\n\nTherefore, Karma Yoga -- Yoga Yukta Bhava, become Yoga Yukta. Yoga Yukta Bhava is to develop the art of performing actions for the greater good, not for myself. And the technique given to us in this chapter says: while you are performing all your actions, constantly think that you are not doing anything. Pralapan, vishrujan, srunan, svashan -- even when you are breathing, seeing, hearing, touching, think that you are not doing that.

The observer who is observing this activity is someone other than body, mind, and intellect. So constantly see yourself as the witness of your own activity. Just as when we witness other people and say, \"I know he's doing well, he's not doing well, I think he's wrong or he's right\" -- but we are not involved in it.

If you really want to evolve in this Prakriti act for the greater good.\n\nAll your activities must be for the greater good -- for the Yajna spirit, not for you as this self, this body, mind, and intellect, but for the greater good. By acting for this greater good, I will rise above this selfish ego and purify my mind and intellect. Now, we have been given free will.

      "reflection": "These verses describe the liberated state with increasing precision. Verse 19 declares that those \"whose minds remain always balanced\" have \"conquered their earth-life\" even while living - because \"the Supreme has neither blemish nor bias.\" Verse 20 describes one who \"is not elated by pleasure or depressed by pain.\" And verse 21 reveals the secret: \"He finds happiness in his own Self\" because his \"heart does not yearn for the contacts of earth.\" This is not suppression but genuine fulfillment - one who has found the inner spring no longer thirsts for external waters.\n\nPractice \"sthira-buddhi\" (steady intellect) from verse 20 today. When something pleasant happens - a compliment, good news, a small success - notice the tendency to become elated. When something unpleasant occurs - criticism, inconvenience, frustration - notice the tendency to become disturbed. In both cases, return to center. Ask yourself: \"Does this event add to or subtract from my essential being?\" The answer is always no - you remain the same awareness whether praised or blamed. Verse 21 points to the deeper practice: finding \"sukham\" (happiness) within the Self rather than in \"bahya-sparsha\" (external contacts). Today, set aside even five minutes to simply be - not meditating on anything, not seeking any experience, just resting as awareness itself. Notice if there is a subtle contentment that requires nothing. This is \"akshaya sukham\" - the inexhaustible happiness that depends on nothing external."

      "commentary": "We are discussing chapter 5, Sannyasa Yoga, Yoga of Renunciation. Renunciation is always about anything that we think we are possessing -- in this case, our actions. We think our actions are our own, and therefore renouncing those actions is the renunciation. So far we have learnt in Bhagavad Gita who we are as limited beings. As we had discussed many times before, the first six chapters of Bhagavad Gita describe \"tvam\" in that Mahavakya \"Tat Tvam Asi\" -- \"That Thou Art.\" \"Thou,\" the \"you,\" is what we have learned so far. In chapter one, we encountered the situation which we encounter in our daily life.\n\nA common man facing day-to-day situations which never come clean-cut as black and white, good or bad, happy or unhappy. They always have complexity which makes me confused about what is right and wrong, which action to take. So we have seen Arjuna's situation. He cannot see whether there is good in fighting the battle or running away from it. Fighting the battle is going to create some collateral damage, as we have seen recently in Afghanistan. Some people who I really respect and revere may also get hurt or killed.\n\nAnd that happens in our life all the time. So the first chapter describes our situation as we face it in life today. The second chapter told us that what we think we are is not who we are. So there is a paradigm shift for us. We consider this self to be this limited me -- this body, mind, and intellect. And at the end of my journey in this life, this self will be destroyed.\n\nBut the self that I truly am will never be destroyed. Death will be only for the body. So that's a paradigm shift for us. Now, understanding that still does not give me what to do next. So the third chapter gave us the instruction about how to work in this world in an efficient manner. Two things it told us.\n\nOne, it says Swadharma Nidhanam Shreya, Paradharma Bhayavah. Act according to your own nature, your own Prakriti, because that's where your welfare is. Your good is in acting according to your nature. Paradharma Bhayavah -- others' Dharma may seem very noble, very excellent, but you cannot follow that because that's not your Dharma. Act according to your Dharma, and act for the greater good -- not just in a selfish manner for your own good, but in a way that helps the greater community. We called it Karma Yoga.\n\nThe art of acting in this world in a way that purifies my mind and intellect is called Karma Yoga. Then chapter four says, once you have learned how to act outside in this world, now you have to renounce these actions which you consider yours. Even while I'm practicing Karma Yoga, I still think \"I'm practicing Karma Yoga.\" So there is still agency involved -- \"I am doing it.\" The fourth chapter says you have to now renounce these actions in knowledge -- knowledge which you already learned in chapter two.\n\nThat is, the self which I consider the self is not the real self. What I consider the self is actually the equipment belonging to the self -- body, mind, and intellect. So in chapter four it says: learn this knowledge about the self and renounce these actions, understanding that these actions belong to the Prakriti, to this body, mind, and intellect -- they do not belong to me, the self. That's chapter four.\n\nChapter five -- we started seeing Karma Sannyasa. Now, how to really gain this Sannyasa which we talked about in chapter four?\n\nSo we have this detailed instruction about how to think, how to adjust our attitude towards actions. And the first thing it said is, think that you are not doing anything. And then it says, Brahmani Yadhaya, Karmani, Sangam, Tyaktva Karutiyah. The person who devote all his actions to the Brahman, that universal self, not just myself as the limited self, but I am doing it for that greater self. Then he does not incur any sin. He does not incur any negative impression on his mind.\n\nOur problem is we take our actions so personally that somebody says, neel, you are not doing well. We get hurt right away. Right away it tells me that this person is not respecting me and it starts putting the negative impression. So the next time when I have to do that, I'll be thinking twice, should I be doing it? Will people appreciate it or will it not be appreciated? So that negative impression will not be on the mind of a person who is not doing it with this limited ego.\n\nBecause to him, action is an action, the result is a result. So he has no impression on his mind. So such a person will act in this world like a Padmapatra, the lotus leaf which remaining in the water coming out of the mud does not ever get tainted by any of that. Water falls on it, it rolls off. So that's the technique given to us in this chapter. In such a person who is constantly thinking about his self as the greater self will be liberated from these limitations.\n\nAnd then we have seen: how will such a Yogi behave in this world once he gets to that level? Bahyasparseshu Asaktatma -- he is unattached to the contacts outside. Sa Brahma Yoga Yuktamatma Sukham Akshayam Ashnute -- we are constantly seeking unlimited happiness. We are not seeking limited happiness, though we think we are happy if we get some limited happiness.\n\nGreen card, Green card, Green card. Once I have it I won't ask for anything more. But I know the next thing I'll ask is -- now I got the green card, maybe I need to find the right person to get married. So people say take a vacation for three weeks from your job, go to India to find a bride. And they say, \"Neel, I can't do it in three weeks because my parents have lined up so many girls to meet.\"\n\nBut I think I still need some more time. Can I get two more weeks of vacation? And then it continues. We are seeking unlimited happiness. And Bhagavan said there's only one formula that works. Sua Saktatma is unattached to the context outside in this world.\n\nSa Brahma Yogi Yuktatma -- such a person is a Yogi. He is one with the Brahman, connected with the Brahman. And all of this seems very difficult to practice. So the next verse says, remember -- what is there if I am going to avoid all these pleasures in my life? What is the fun of living life?\n\nWhen I was a teenager, we used to have this joke: when you go up to Chitragupta, he will ask what you did with your life. So we have to justify -- if you didn't experience anything, what did you do? Go back, experience all that, and then come back. So we think, if I don't experience any pleasure in this world, what is there to live this life for? They say, well, you can experience all these pleasures.\n\nRemember, Ye hi samsparshaja bhoga dukha yonaya -- these pleasures coming out of contact with the objects in the world outside have a limited capacity; they are actually a womb of unhappiness. So unless you are careful, you will realize that these pleasures are Adi and Antavanta -- they start at one point in time and will end. So you don't get Ramate, don't get engrossed in them. You experience the pleasure and move on.\n\nIt's not that it's a nice day, I'm saying no, I mean this is not good. I mean how can you have a nice day? How can I enjoy nice day? Gita tells me it's all Adiyanta Vanta. But when there's a nice day, enjoy it. But next day when there's not nice, don't complain.\n\nThat's all it says -- not that you are going to complain about why we don't have nice days, why he's not controlling the climate. We know this is the reality of life. The next three verses tell us why one should be detached from these contacts outside, and how. Shaknoteehaiva yaha sodhum prak shareera vimokshanaat, Kama krodh udbhavam vegam, sa yuktaha sa sukhi naraha.\n\nThe happy person definition is here. We are very happy, elated. I read on Facebook somewhere that may your life be as happy as it seems on Facebook. Because we know that that's not the reality, right? We are not putting all the garbage from our life on the Facebook. So Sukhi who is truly sukhi, not who appears to be happy.\n\nWe all appear to be happy from the other person's point of view. \"Neel, you're doing very well.\" Only Neel knows how he is doing, right? Bhagavan said, Shaknoti hi evaha yaha sodhum prak shareera vimokshanath -- before this body disintegrates, who can withhold the vega, the power, the udbhavam, that force which is generated in my mind by Kama (desire) and Krodha (anger)?\n\nIt did not say you will not have Kama or Krodha. Vega is the operative word here. When it is flowing peacefully in a serene manner, it is the most enjoyable thing, right? People enjoy the river. Some of our friends have houses right on the river. And we all go in envy and say James river.\n\nWhen a storm was predicted, people were preparing. But the James River, when it is flowing peacefully, there is no problem. It gives peace and happiness to anybody. Our mind is like the river. When it is flowing in a peaceful, serene manner, it takes you towards happiness. When do we think about inspired projects or inspired actions? When we feel happy. When we are calm and happy, then we say, let's do this.\n\nWhen I am upset, no matter how good an idea is put in front of me, forget about it. So the mind has to be serene and flowing in an appropriate manner towards its goal. Then only can peace and happiness come. But when this uninvited guest -- the flood -- comes, it will be manifold, uncontrollable, and anything that comes in its way will be destroyed. Bhagavan said that Kama and Krodha, when that desire is so powerful that you are rushing towards the object of desire and whatever comes in your way you want to destroy --\n\nThat's anger. That Vega should be withheld. A person who can withhold the force of Kama and Krodha in his mind is Yukta -- he is the one who is connected with his own self. He will then be happy in all situations, because he has control over the flow of his thoughts. Mind, as we have learned in Tattva Bodhi, is nothing but the flow of thoughts.\n\nOne thought does not make a mind. The second thought creates the genesis of mind. Then more and more thoughts -- the second thought gives rise to the third, the fourth, and the fifth in the same direction. Thoughts flowing in one direction create a focused mind. As long as the mind is flowing toward the right destination in a disciplined manner, it creates happiness. When my desires are all over the place -- I want to be a billionaire, and then I also want to become a wise person, and then I also want to be a sports personality -- then I'm torn all over and creating disaster.\n\nA person who develops this capacity before this body disintegrates -- because after that you don't really have any chance -- this is your chance to create discipline in your mind. Such a person is Sukhi Naraha. The verse says \"Yo Antaha Sukho\" -- one who finds happiness within.",
      "reflection": "Verse 22 delivers a sobering truth about worldly pleasures: \"The joys that spring from external associations bring pain; they have their beginning and their endings.\" This is not pessimism but precise observation - every contact-born pleasure is inherently temporary, carrying within it the seed of its own ending. Verse 23 then offers the practical challenge: master \"the promptings of desire and anger\" before death. Verse 24 reveals the reward: one who is \"happy within his Self\" and in whom \"the inner light shines\" attains \"Eternal Bliss and becomes the Spirit Itself.\"\n\nToday, observe the adi-antavanta (beginning-and-ending) nature of pleasures. When you enjoy your morning coffee, notice it begins, peaks, and ends. When a pleasant conversation lifts your mood, watch how the feeling fades. This is not to become joyless but to see clearly - as verse 22 says, \"the wise man does not rejoice in them\" because he knows their nature. The more profound practice from verse 23 is working with kama (desire) and krodha (anger). Notice that the verse says to \"surmount\" their \"promptings\" - not eliminate desire and anger, but master their vega (force). When desire arises today, can you feel its pull without being swept away? When anger flares, can you experience its heat without acting from it? This mastery, Krishna promises, leads to the state of verse 24: antah-sukha (inner happiness), antar-arama (inner rejoicing), and antar-jyoti (inner light). Even a glimpse of this inner fullness changes everything."

      "commentary": "We are discussing chapter 5, Sannyasa Yoga, Yoga of Renunciation. Renunciation is always about anything that we think we are possessing -- in this case, our actions. We think our actions are our own, and therefore renouncing those actions is the renunciation. So far we have learnt in Bhagavad Gita who we are as limited beings. As we had discussed many times before, the first six chapters of Bhagavad Gita describe \"tvam\" in that Mahavakya \"Tat Tvam Asi\" -- \"That Thou Art.\" \"Thou,\" the \"you,\" is what we have learned so far. In chapter one, we encountered the situation which we encounter in our daily life.\n\nA common man facing day-to-day situations which never come clean-cut as black and white, good or bad, happy or unhappy. They always have complexity which makes me confused about what is right and wrong, which action to take. So we have seen Arjuna's situation. He cannot see whether there is good in fighting the battle or running away from it. Fighting the battle is going to create some collateral damage, as we have seen recently in Afghanistan. Some people who I really respect and revere may also get hurt or killed.\n\nAnd that happens in our life all the time. So the first chapter describes our situation as we face it in life today. The second chapter told us that what we think we are is not who we are. So there is a paradigm shift for us. We consider this self to be this limited me -- this body, mind, and intellect. And at the end of my journey in this life, this self will be destroyed.\n\nBut the self that I truly am will never be destroyed. Death will be only for the body. So that's a paradigm shift for us. Now, understanding that still does not give me what to do next. So the third chapter gave us the instruction about how to work in this world in an efficient manner. Two things it told us.\n\nOne, it says Swadharma Nidhanam Shreya, Paradharma Bhayavah. Act according to your own nature, your own Prakriti, because that's where your welfare is. Your good is in acting according to your nature. Paradharma Bhayavah -- others' Dharma may seem very noble, very excellent, but you cannot follow that because that's not your Dharma. Act according to your Dharma, and act for the greater good -- not just in a selfish manner for your own good, but in a way that helps the greater community. We called it Karma Yoga.\n\nThe art of acting in this world in a way that purifies my mind and intellect is called Karma Yoga. Then chapter four says, once you have learned how to act outside in this world, now you have to renounce these actions which you consider yours. Even while I'm practicing Karma Yoga, I still think \"I'm practicing Karma Yoga.\" So there is still agency involved -- \"I am doing it.\" The fourth chapter says you have to now renounce these actions in knowledge -- knowledge which you already learned in chapter two.\n\nThat is, the self which I consider the self is not the real self. What I consider the self is actually the equipment belonging to the self -- body, mind, and intellect. So in chapter four it says: learn this knowledge about the self and renounce these actions, understanding that these actions belong to the Prakriti, to this body, mind, and intellect -- they do not belong to me, the self. That's chapter four.\n\nChapter five -- we started seeing Karma Sannyasa. Now, how to really gain this Sannyasa which we talked about in chapter four?\n\nSo we have this detailed instruction about how to think, how to adjust our attitude towards actions. And the first thing it said is, think that you are not doing anything. And then it says, Brahmani Yadhaya, Karmani, Sangam, Tyaktva Karutiyah. The person who devote all his actions to the Brahman, that universal self, not just myself as the limited self, but I am doing it for that greater self. Then he does not incur any sin. He does not incur any negative impression on his mind.\n\nOur problem is we take our actions so personally that somebody says, neel, you are not doing well. We get hurt right away. Right away it tells me that this person is not respecting me and it starts putting the negative impression. So the next time when I have to do that, I'll be thinking twice, should I be doing it? Will people appreciate it or will it not be appreciated? So that negative impression will not be on the mind of a person who is not doing it with this limited ego.\n\nBecause to him, action is an action, the result is a result. So he has no impression on his mind. So such a person will act in this world like a Padmapatra, the lotus leaf which remaining in the water coming out of the mud does not ever get tainted by any of that. Water falls on it, it rolls off. So that's the technique given to us in this chapter. In such a person who is constantly thinking about his self as the greater self will be liberated from these limitations.\n\nAnd then we have seen: how will such a Yogi behave in this world once he gets to that level? Bahyasparseshu Asaktatma -- he is unattached to the contacts outside. Sa Brahma Yoga Yuktamatma Sukham Akshayam Ashnute -- we are constantly seeking unlimited happiness. We are not seeking limited happiness, though we think we are happy if we get some limited happiness.\n\nGreen card, Green card, Green card. Once I have it I won't ask for anything more. But I know the next thing I'll ask is -- now I got the green card, maybe I need to find the right person to get married. So people say take a vacation for three weeks from your job, go to India to find a bride. And they say, \"Neel, I can't do it in three weeks because my parents have lined up so many girls to meet.\"\n\nBut I think I still need some more time. Can I get two more weeks of vacation? And then it continues. We are seeking unlimited happiness. And Bhagavan said there's only one formula that works. Sua Saktatma is unattached to the context outside in this world.\n\nSa Brahma Yogi Yuktatma -- such a person is a Yogi. He is one with the Brahman, connected with the Brahman. And all of this seems very difficult to practice. So the next verse says, remember -- what is there if I am going to avoid all these pleasures in my life? What is the fun of living life?\n\nWhen I was a teenager, we used to have this joke: when you go up to Chitragupta, he will ask what you did with your life. So we have to justify -- if you didn't experience anything, what did you do? Go back, experience all that, and then come back. So we think, if I don't experience any pleasure in this world, what is there to live this life for? They say, well, you can experience all these pleasures.\n\nRemember, Ye hi samsparshaja bhoga dukha yonaya -- these pleasures coming out of contact with the objects in the world outside have a limited capacity; they are actually a womb of unhappiness. So unless you are careful, you will realize that these pleasures are Adi and Antavanta -- they start at one point in time and will end. So you don't get Ramate, don't get engrossed in them. You experience the pleasure and move on.\n\nIt's not that it's a nice day, I'm saying no, I mean this is not good. I mean how can you have a nice day? How can I enjoy nice day? Gita tells me it's all Adiyanta Vanta. But when there's a nice day, enjoy it. But next day when there's not nice, don't complain.\n\nThat's all it says -- not that you are going to complain about why we don't have nice days, why he's not controlling the climate. We know this is the reality of life. The next three verses tell us why one should be detached from these contacts outside, and how. Shaknoteehaiva yaha sodhum prak shareera vimokshanaat, Kama krodh udbhavam vegam, sa yuktaha sa sukhi naraha.\n\nThe happy person definition is here. We are very happy, elated. I read on Facebook somewhere that may your life be as happy as it seems on Facebook. Because we know that that's not the reality, right? We are not putting all the garbage from our life on the Facebook. So Sukhi who is truly sukhi, not who appears to be happy.\n\nWe all appear to be happy from the other person's point of view. \"Neel, you're doing very well.\" Only Neel knows how he is doing, right? Bhagavan said, Shaknoti hi evaha yaha sodhum prak shareera vimokshanath -- before this body disintegrates, who can withhold the vega, the power, the udbhavam, that force which is generated in my mind by Kama (desire) and Krodha (anger)?\n\nIt did not say you will not have Kama or Krodha. Vega is the operative word here. When it is flowing peacefully in a serene manner, it is the most enjoyable thing, right? People enjoy the river. Some of our friends have houses right on the river. And we all go in envy and say James river.\n\nWhen a storm was predicted, people were preparing. But the James River, when it is flowing peacefully, there is no problem. It gives peace and happiness to anybody. Our mind is like the river. When it is flowing in a peaceful, serene manner, it takes you towards happiness. When do we think about inspired projects or inspired actions? When we feel happy. When we are calm and happy, then we say, let's do this.\n\nWhen I am upset, no matter how good an idea is put in front of me, forget about it. So the mind has to be serene and flowing in an appropriate manner towards its goal. Then only can peace and happiness come. But when this uninvited guest -- the flood -- comes, it will be manifold, uncontrollable, and anything that comes in its way will be destroyed. Bhagavan said that Kama and Krodha, when that desire is so powerful that you are rushing towards the object of desire and whatever comes in your way you want to destroy --\n\nThat's anger. That Vega should be withheld. A person who can withhold the force of Kama and Krodha in his mind is Yukta -- he is the one who is connected with his own self. He will then be happy in all situations, because he has control over the flow of his thoughts. Mind, as we have learned in Tattva Bodhi, is nothing but the flow of thoughts.\n\nOne thought does not make a mind. The second thought creates the genesis of mind. Then more and more thoughts -- the second thought gives rise to the third, the fourth, and the fifth in the same direction. Thoughts flowing in one direction create a focused mind.

Such a person is Sukhi Naraha. The verse says \"Yo Antaha Sukho\" -- one who finds happiness within.",
      "reflection": "Verse 25 lists the qualifications of those who attain Brahma-nirvana: \"sins washed away, sense of separateness vanished, self subdued, and seeking only the welfare of all.\" Notice especially \"chinna-dvaidha\" - the cutting away of duality, the sense that I am separate from you and from the world. Verse 26 adds that for those free from desire and anger, \"Eternal Bliss exists everywhere\" - not just in meditation but in all directions. Verse 27 then begins the technical instruction for meditation: excluding external objects, fixing the gaze between the eyebrows, and equalizing the inward and outward breath.\n\nToday, work with \"sarva-bhuta-hite ratah\" from verse 25 - being devoted to the welfare of all beings. This is not merely doing good deeds but a fundamental shift in orientation from self-centered to all-inclusive. Ask yourself: \"How would I act differently if I truly felt the wellbeing of everyone around me as my own?\" Let this inform your choices today. For a more contemplative practice, experiment with the technique in verse 27: sit quietly and bring awareness to the space between your eyebrows, the ajna chakra. Without straining the eyes, let attention rest there gently. Then notice your breath - can you make the inhalation and exhalation equal in duration and smooth in quality? This pranayama practice, equalizing prana and apana, naturally calms the mind. Even five minutes of this practice demonstrates verse 26's promise: when desire and anger subside, peace reveals itself as already present, surrounding us \"abhitah\" - on all sides."

      ],
      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 5, Karma Sannyasa Yoga, Yoga of True Renunciation of Actions. We are coming to the concluding part of chapter five -- the last three verses. We have seen previously that Bhagavan said the one who develops qualities appropriate to merge with Brahman, he merges with Brahman. Yah Antaha Sukhaha Antahramah Tatha Antah Jyotihi Evayaha, Sahayogi Brahmanirvanam, Brahma Bhutodi Gachade. These are the qualifications one must develop if he wants to attain that eternal liberation, to merge with the supreme Self.\n\nIf he wants to achieve the final goal of complete liberation, he needs to understand that this finite being is not capable of attaining that. He has to leave attachment to this finite being -- this body, mind, and intellect -- which is running outside seeking happiness. That idea, that happiness lies outside in the world, has to be renounced. And he has to develop qualities where he becomes satisfied within his own self. Yaha Antaha Sukhaha -- who finds his happiness within himself. Ya Antahramaha -- who revels in his own self. Antah Jyoti --\n\nHe reveals his own existence. I do not need anyone to convince me that I exist. Verification is required for everything else -- whether I'm smart, whether I'm powerful, whether I achieved anything, am I an architect or not. I need verification for all of that. But whether I exist? I need no verification.\n\nI know the self -- it is self-emerging knowledge. One who relies on that, one who identifies with that -- Sahayogi Brahmanirvanam -- he loses his limited self. He loses his identity in that greater identity. As we have seen in our analogy, when a small company merges with a big company, the small company's name goes away and it becomes one with the larger company. Labhante Brahma Nirvanam, Rishayah Kshina Kalmashaha. But to achieve that, you have to become Kshina Kalma -- without any impurities of mind. Those who have purified themselves of all sins, they achieve this Brahma Nirvanam.\n\nThey dissolve themselves into Brahman. And we have seen that sin is nothing but the agitations in my mind. As long as I want something out of this world, it's a desire. And as long as I don't have it, I'm incomplete -- that creates agitation. If I acquire it, I want to preserve it.\n\nThat creates another agitation. I accomplished all that. I have this bank balance in my 401k. It seems I'm set for my retirement of what happens if the market collapses and I lose everything. So there's always fear of preserving what I have and also an anxiety about what I have not accomplished. One who is without this agitation in his mind, whose mind is purified, he attains that ultimate truth.\n\nHe becomes one with that supreme self. Chinna Dvaidha -- he does not see the duality. Up till now I have lived my life as an island. The world is outside, competing with me, and I have to get my happiness out of it. So I'm constantly in battle with this world as an individual. If that individuality is dissolved, if I expand my identification -- as we have seen before, right now my ego is concentrated in my limited self which I call myself.\n\nIf I can expand my ego to include others -- my identification. At a small level, we all do that. We identify with our family, we identify with our friends, our community, our nation. Therefore, when Brazil was not doing well with coronavirus, we were not that upset. But when India is not doing well --\n\nWe are all very disturbed. Because of identification. I have expanded my identification from just me to the country where I was born and raised, and also the country where I live. Chinna Dvaidha -- they have expanded their identification to include everything. Yatatmanaha -- one who has control over this limited self. Once I identify with the world, then my purpose becomes seeking the welfare of all beings.\n\nSo these are the qualifications of the person who wants to achieve liberation -- the Mumukshu, who is desirous of Moksha. One who is happy the way he is does not need anything to do with this. But one who is not happy with the condition he is in and wants that liberation -- for him, these are the qualifications he has to achieve, that he has to strive for.\n\nAnd then the next three verses -- the last three verses -- are actually introductory verses for the next chapter. Swamiji explains that in Sanskrit literature it is very common for the author to introduce a subject at the end of a chapter so that you are ready for the next chapter. It's like in Gujarati magazines -- the story gets very interesting and then it ends and says the more interesting part will be in the next edition. Bhagavan is also using a similar technique. He's introducing meditation in these last three verses.\n\nThese verses are more like sutras, very succinct. The entire process of meditation and the goal is described. It says Sparshan krutva bahir bahyan, chakshushcha iva antare bhruvoh, prana-apanau samau krutva nasa-abhyantara charinau. Here, the entire technique of meditation is given. The first instruction is Sparshan krutva bahir bahyan -- keep all the sense objects outside, outside of your perception.\n\nSo don't let the senses bring the information from outside of the sense objects which then creates these impressions on your mind. You shut off that mechanism of bringing all those impressions from the outside. This is something like if you have an old style camera which has a Kodak film in it. If you open the shutter, whatever is inside the image will come inside to the lens. And then the film is like your mind. So the film will capture the impression on it.\n\nSo there are two ways you can avoid taking any picture. One is you don't open the lens at all. I have done it before -- forgot to remove the cap. I kept clicking but nothing appeared on the film because the lens was covered. Kathopanishad says you should fold your senses into the mind.\n\nThe senses are turned inward; they are not looking outwards. Then there is no experience from outside. Or keep the experience outside only -- don't let it influence your mind. And focus your gaze at the juncture of your eyebrows. Now that you have turned your gaze inside, you have to focus on your mind.\n\nSo now the mind is focused, laserized. There are good explanations about the scientific and medical implications of focusing between the eyes. But from a yogic perspective, we are focused on the Ajna chakra. In our bodies we have six chakras. In some traditions there is a seventh chakra, the Sahasrara chakra, also called Brahmarandra. That's your exit point when you die, if you are a Yogi.\n\nBhagavan says here, focus on your Ajna chakra. The Ajna chakra is also called the third eye. In our literature, Shiva had a third eye -- the eye of wisdom. This third eye or Ajna chakra is associated with the subtle body, the mind and intellect. So rather than focusing on the world outside, now you focus on the world inside -- on your mind and intellect -- and turn them towards this chakra, which is a connection between you and the supreme. Bhagavan said, Chakshushcha eva antare bruvaha.\n\nFocus your attention between the two eyebrows, at the Ajna chakra. It also corresponds to the pineal gland in your physiology. That is why we have a bindi in our culture at that point, and why the Yogis put Chandan tilak to keep that Ajna chakra protected.\n\nPrana Apanau Samau Krutva -- equalizing the prana and apana. We also learnt in chapter three, I think it was verse 29, which says they offer the Prana into Apana or Apana into Prana. One of the Yajnas is this Prana-Apana Yajna, which is basically Pranayama with retention and breath control.\n\nThe Rishis developed this great technique after noticing that the mind affects breathing. So if I use that knowledge -- that there is a connection between my mind and my breathing -- I can control breathing to control my mind. This whole elaborate science of Pranayama was developed based on this principle. So here it says, make Prana and Apana equal. When there is no imbalance between the two, the mind also becomes balanced and controlled.\n\nI have read Dnyaneshwar Maharaj's Dnyaneshwari, and it explains this beautifully: combine the power of Prana and Apana together and direct it towards your Sahasrara Chakra. The energy which is right now used for maintaining this body gets equalized so that the body is maintained with very minimal energy, and the rest is focused towards your Sahasrara chakra. According to yogic tradition, we have a connection with our greater self through that chakra. So Bhagavan says, balance your Prana and Apana -- Nasabhyantara Charinau -- which flow through your nostrils.\n\nYat Indriyaha Manaha Buddhi Munihi Moksha Parayanaha. If you are desirous of liberation, if the goal is to achieve liberation, then you have to make this preparation throughout your life. It is not something where you get up one morning and start meditating. Bhagavan Buddha did not get up that morning under a Bodhi tree and say, \"I need to meditate and achieve enlightenment.\" He had to work all his life to achieve that enlightenment. This is the practice that controls my organs, my senses, my Manas (mind), and my Buddhi (intellect).\n\nThis cannot happen overnight, as we know. It is also not going to happen just because you decided to do so. It's a constant practice without any gap. Eknathi Swaran used to say that if you miss a day in meditation, it takes a week to make up. If you miss a week of meditation, it takes a month to make it up. If you miss a month, it takes a year to make it up.\n\nSo it's a constant practice to control your organs, control your mind, control intellect. Now we are all doing it. So it's not something which is not in our control. We control over organs in a sense. We don't behave in an inappropriate manner in the public. We also control our mind.\n\nSometimes we feel like doing something, but we realize it's not the right thing to do. So we control our mind. We control intellect too. Sometimes we get fancy ideas, but then we think, no, that's not the right thing. We do have capabilities. Except our goal is different in using that capability.\n\nWe're trying to achieve something from this world. Here it says Moksha Parayanaha -- those who are Mumukshu, those who are desirous of liberation, they use this capability to control mind, intellect, and body in achieving that liberation. Vigata Icchha Bhaya Krodhaha -- this is only possible if you're without desire, fear, and anger. We know that our life is basically nothing but a permutation and combination of these three. Either we are desirous of getting something, or we are fearful that we may not get it, or we are angry.\n\nThat's because my mind is right now turned outside, seeking happiness. If I realize that happiness does not lie outside -- the world of objects has no capability to give me happiness. As we have seen, every object which gives me happiness has equal capability to give me unhappiness. If that's true, they actually cancel each other out. It is like particles which have a negative and positive charge -- they cancel each other out and disappear.\n\nThese objects are illusory. They do not have the essential thing which I am seeking -- happiness.",
      "reflection": "The final two verses of Chapter 5 bring the teaching to its culmination. Verse 28 describes the sage who is \"governing sense, mind and intellect\" and is \"free from desire, fear and anger\" - such a one is \"forever free.\" Verse 29 then reveals the key to eternal peace: knowing the Divine as the receiver of all sacrifices and austerities, as the \"Mighty Ruler of all the Worlds,\" and most beautifully, as \"the Friend of all beings\" (suhridam sarva-bhutanam). This friendship of the Divine is not a sentimental notion but a recognition that the deepest reality is not indifferent to us but intimately connected.\n\nToday, contemplate the three aspects of the Divine in verse 29. First, \"bhoktaram yajna-tapasam\" - the Divine receives all our efforts, sacrifices, and disciplines. Nothing is wasted; every sincere effort is received. Can you offer your day's work with this understanding? Second, \"sarva-loka-maheshvaram\" - the Divine is the sovereign of all worlds. This removes the burden of trying to control outcomes. Third, and most transformative, \"suhridam sarva-bhutanam\" - the Divine is the friend of all beings, including you. Meditate on this: the ultimate Reality is not a cold, impersonal force but a presence that wishes you well. How would you live differently if you truly felt befriended by existence itself? The chapter concludes with the promise: knowing this, one \"passes to Eternal Peace.\" Today, let this friendship be your foundation - approach each moment knowing you are supported by the deepest reality, that the universe is not hostile but hospitable to your awakening."

      "commentary": "We have completed chapter five. Now we'll be discussing chapter six. Swami Chinmayananda says meditation is not a verb, it's a noun. It is a state to be achieved, not something you do. What you do is actually called contemplation. So what we have seen in Bhagavad Gita so far is the conclusion of the first set of chapters, and we are coming to this culminating chapter, Dhyana Yoga, which will indicate the state we have to achieve.\n\nSo we have discussed many times that Bhagavad Gita is divided into three distinct sections, each having six chapters. According to Anandagiri, who was a 13th century head of Dwarka Mutt, Bhagavad Gita is an exposition on the Mahavakya Tattvamasi. The Mahavakya is a statement which connects the lower to the higher, the jiva to the Paramatma. Tattvamasi is a Mahavakya from the Chandogya Upanishad. Bhagavan Ved Vyas wrote Bhagavad Gita. Then Bhagavan Sankaracharya wrote a Bhasya on Bhagavad Gita, and then Anandagiri wrote a Tika on Sankaracharya's Bhasya. There he says this Bhagavad Gita is an exposition on Tattvamasi -- \"that thou art.\" There are other opinions about what Bhagavad Gita is and how it is divided. Madhusuddhan Saraswati, a late 16th / early 17th century Advaitic scholar, said that Bhagavad Gita is divided into three parts: Karma Yoga in the first six chapters, Bhakti Yoga in chapters seven through twelve, and Gnana Yoga in chapters thirteen through eighteen. Swamiji also points out that there are others who believe the first six chapters relate to the Karmakanda in the Vedas.\n\nThe next set of six chapters relates to the Upasanakanda, and the last six chapters relate to the Gnanakanda. However, Bhagavan Sankaracharya does not make any such distinction in his Bhasya. He simply says the spiritual evolution described in Bhagavad Gita follows a progression. First, you act in this world with hankering for the fruits -- you are working with expectations.\n\nSo in the first stage -- Hato va prapsyasi swargam, jitva va bhokshyase mahim -- what do you have to lose in performing any action? You shall achieve either heaven if you die, or the kingdom on this earth if you don't. When you're expecting a result, that's your motivation. The second stage is to act without any hankering for the fruits of action, which we have seen as Karma Yoga. And then the third stage in the spiritual evolution is the integration of the mind with Upasana.\n\nThe last stage, he says, is realization -- acquiring the knowledge. So far, what we have seen is this: in chapter one, we have seen the confusion of an ordinary person of this world, which we all are. We want to act in this world and get the right results, but we do not know what actions are right. That's our confusion. Arjuna Vishada Yoga explained that through Arjuna's condition. Chapter two gave us the philosophical perfection of the Upanishads.\n\nThe highest knowledge of the Upanishads was given out right away as the goal. Bhagavan Krishna didn't expect Arjuna to understand immediately, but he presented that knowledge of perfection -- that this self is immutable, imperishable. At the end of the chapter, we also saw the characteristics of a man of perfection, a wise person: how would he act in this world? Once you achieve the state of perfect wisdom, you will have a balanced mind. Then chapter three gave us the path of Karma Yoga, the method of self-integration of our mind and intellect.\n\nThat's the second stage. First you act with the desire for the fruits. Then you act without desire or expectation for the fruit. So that's chapter three. And chapter four actually gives the various means, Bahiranga, Sadhana, the external aids, how to perform Karma Yoga. So we have seen many Yajnas in chapter four.\n\nThen chapter five gave us a technique. Even while working in this world without any expectations, there will be some impact on your mind. To avoid that, chapter five gives you the path of Renunciation: you give up the sense of agency for your actions while performing actions selflessly. You must also renounce your sense of doership. That's what we saw in chapter five. Renouncing the sense of agency is Sannyasa Yoga, the Yoga of Renunciation.\n\nAnd now all that knowledge, if you have been practicing diligently, then Bhagavan said, you are ready for Dhyana Yoga, Yoga of Meditation. Swamiji says it's a yoga of contemplation. Meditation is a state to reach. Contemplation is way to achieve that. So that is Dhyana Yoga. So you have to prepare yourself with Karma Yoga to get to Dhyana Yoga.\n\nSo the chapter literally opens with that statement. Anashritah Karmaphalam karyam karma karoti yah -- one who performs actions without depending on the fruits of actions. Sa sannyasi cha yogi cha, na niragnir na chakriyah -- such a person is a sannyasi and a yogi. Bhagavan is now relating both yoga (which can be viewed as Karma Yoga) and sannyas as one and the same.\n\nThe ultimate result is one and the same as long as you perform Karma Yoga without any expectation for the fruits. This is basically clarification. Because we carry baggage of our culture. We see sannyasi as somebody who has given up all activities, one who is completely inactive from a society's perspective. He does not have a job, he does not have a family, he has no relationship, he has given up everything. Sannyasi is the one who renounced everything.\n\nAll means of making a living, all possessions, all relationships, including possession of his body. When somebody takes sannyas, he actually performs his own last rites. He then wears the saffron robe. He's not doing anything. But Bhagavan said, outwardly that person may have taken sannyas, but if he has not given up the fruits of actions, then he's not a sannyasi. Akriyah -- he seems inactive, but that does not mean he is a sannyasi. Niragnir means one who does not have fire. This fire comes from our Vedic culture where every householder will have a fire in his house. Because fire is necessary for your day to day cooking, but also for the religious rites. All the religious practices or upasanas were done through fire, yagnas, homas. So they used to continually keep fire in the house because they didn't have this instant matches or lighters. So they'll keep a fire burning in the house so that when they need fire, they can use that to light bigger fire. So person who is a householder will always have fire in his house.\n\nThe sannyasi gives up that responsibility of carrying fire. He doesn't need to cook anymore, nor is he performing any religious rites or traditional pujas. Bhagavan clarifies this: a person may have given up the grihastha ashram.\n\nBut if he is not at that mental level, then he is not a sannyasi. If he has not renounced his sense of agency and the fruits of actions, then he is not a sannyasi. The clarification is that sannyasa is a state of mind -- a state of renouncing the sense of agency. The one who is a yogi is also a sannyasi; the sannyasi is also a yogi. In the next verse, Bhagavan says: Yam sannyasam iti prahuh yogam tam viddhi Pandava -- O Pandava, that which is said to be sannyasa.\n\nSannyasa is renouncing the sense of agency. Prahuh yogam tam viddhi Pandava -- so that sannyasa is also yoga. Because without becoming a yogi, one cannot become a sannyasi. Na hi asannyasta sankalpah yogi bhavati kashchana -- without renouncing Sankalpa, one cannot become a yogi. Sankalpa, Swamiji says, is a difficult word to translate in English.\n\nBut expectations -- na hi asannyasta sankalpah yogi bhavati kashchana. One who has not given up expectations cannot become a yogi. One who has not given up the fancies of the mind cannot become a yogi. Swamiji elaborates on what Sankalpa is. It is confusing for us because in our culture, in our vernacular languages, in our religious practices, you always do Sankalpa before you start any puja. Panditji will say, \"do Sankalpa.\"\n\nSo Sankalpa also means termination, taking a vow. When I decide that this action, I'm doing it for this reason, that's a sankalpa. I'm going to be regular in my exercise every day. I'll go for a walk every day as we do on a. I guess a New Year's Eve, a resolution. Because you have a goal in mind, you have a result in mind. But Bhagavan says that this Sankalpa should be given up if you want to become a yogi.\n\nBecause Sankalpa is directed toward a future result, which is exactly contrary to Karma Yoga. Karma Yoga is not to expect any results. Sankalpa is to expect a result in the future and then work towards it -- there is nothing wrong in it. But the human mind is such that Sankalpa does not remain constant. We all know that every resolution we make on New Year's Eve, by the time that month is over, we have forgotten about it and moved on to some other Sankalpa. The nature of our mind is to make a Sankalpa for the future.\n\nBut the action can always be performed in present. And before we start that action in present, we move on to the next Sankalpa. We want to do something else. So we never reach a goal. Because the goal is constantly a moving target that the fancy of our mind. So to stop that one has to give up Sankalpa.\n\nOne has to learn how to give up this fancy of a mind. And I heard that you have to learn how to give up Sankalpa to get Sankalpa Siddhi. Sankalpa Siddhi means you're determined to get something, you work towards it, and you get it. So if you make a Sankalpa for something unattainable -- like Moksha, liberation -- then first you have to learn how to give up the other fancies of your mind. Give up all the other fleeting Sankalpas and just work toward that one Sankalpa of liberation. Then you can reach that. So learn how to give up minor Sankalpas so you can achieve Sankalpa Siddhi for the ultimate goal. Bhagavan here says that no one can become a yogi who has not given up Sankalpa. He is already a renouncer.\n\nHe has given up Sankalpa. He is a sannyasi and therefore he is a yogi. So yogi and sannyasi are one and the same. Then the Gita tells us who should practice what -- who is capable of inactivity and who should perform actions. We have already seen that inactivity is not an option for us. It's not possible for any living being to be inactive.\n\nBut inactivity is the goal. We want Nishkarma Siddhi -- we want to retire from our day-to-day pursuits. So he says: Arurukshoh muner yogam karma karanam uchyate -- Karma is the means for a seeker, a muni who wants to ascend to yoga, who wants to become a yogi but is not a yogi yet. The one who has control over his mind is a yogi.\n\nFor one who wants to control his mind but whose mind is not yet in control, Karma is prescribed. Remember, we have started a chapter called Dhyana Yoga. So we expected that Bhagavan would just talk about Dhyana -- how to meditate, what to do. We thought we were done with Karma Yoga.\n\nNow let's focus on Dhyana Yoga. But Bhagavan really puts Karma Yoga at the highest level here and say unless you have practiced Karma Yoga and achieved the results of the Karma Yoga which is the control of the mind, purification of the mind, the next step is not really for you.",
      "reflection": "These opening verses of Dhyana Yoga reveal a profound truth: true renunciation is not about giving up external activities, but about releasing our grip on expected outcomes. As Krishna declares, \"Anashritah karmaphalam karyam karma karoti yah\" - one who performs obligatory actions without depending on the fruits is both a sannyasi and a yogi. This challenges our conventional understanding of spiritual practice. We often believe we must retreat from life to find inner peace, but the Gita insists that real yoga happens in the midst of action, when we learn to work without the anxiety of results.\n\nConsider your own relationship with Sankalpa - those overarching desires and resolutions that constantly shift and change in your mind. How many New Year's resolutions have faded by February? The teaching here is not to eliminate all goals, but to recognize when your fanciful mind is creating endless moving targets that keep you perpetually chasing rather than arriving. Today, examine one activity you perform regularly. Can you do it with full attention and care, yet without mentally leaping ahead to what you hope to gain from it? Notice how giving up expectation paradoxically brings more peace to the action itself.\n\nAsk yourself: Am I still climbing the ladder of yoga (arurukshu), requiring the discipline of Karma Yoga? Or have I reached a place of inner stillness (yoga-rudha) where the mind naturally rests? Be honest - most of us are still climbing, and that is exactly where we should be applying selfless action as our practice."

      "commentary": "What is my purpose and destiny? We have been discussing Chapter 6, Dhyana Yoga, Yoga of Contemplation and Meditation. In the first five chapters, we have seen that Bhagavan defined the word Yoga. In chapter two, Bhagavan defined Yoga: Samatvam Yoga Uchyate -- Yoga is the balance of mind. And then he said, Yogah karmasu kaushalam -- Yoga is dexterity in action. That was given as the goal.\n\nYoga is to balance your mind. Your mind should be balanced in all situations, and that's your goal. Then the next three chapters -- 3, 4, and 5 -- give two techniques to achieve that yoga of balancing the mind. The first is Karma Yoga: do not depend on the Karma Phala. Giving up expectations for results is the technique we call Karma Yoga. The other technique is giving up the sense of agency, which is called sannyasa.\n\nThese two techniques represent two different modes. One promotes actions, but without any expectation of the fruits. The other promotes inaction -- giving up the sense of agency is giving up actions. \"I am not doing anything.\" So for an average person, it may seem contradictory.\n\nOne promotes actions, the other promotes inaction. Also, culturally we have seen that a Karma Yogi is engaged in actions, while a sannyasi has given up all actions. He gives up his job, he gives up his family. Even in olden days, a grihastha was required to perform certain rituals daily. As we have seen, he keeps fire burning in his house all the time because he needs it for performing the rituals. But once he becomes a sannyasi, he is not required to perform any of those actions.\n\nSo in the narrow sense, the Karma Kanda says that a grihastha is required to perform ritualistic actions and a sannyasi is not. We have seen these two opposite sides of the same coin, seemingly contrary to each other. That can create confusion in our mind: is the tyagi or yogi better, or is the sannyasi better? Therefore the chapter opened with a clear declaration from Bhagavan: Anashritah karmaphalam karyam karma karoti yah -- sa sannyasi cha yogi cha. Bhagavan once again extols Karma Yoga as the very means of achieving this balance of mind.\n\nOne who performs actions without depending on the fruits of action is both a yogi and a sannyasi, because sannyasa cannot be achieved -- nor can yoga be achieved -- by merely renouncing actions. Both achieve the same goal of samatvam, the balance of mind which we are looking for. Therefore: Yam sannyasam iti prahuh yogam tam viddhi Pandava -- know that sannyasa is the same thing as what they call Yoga. One who has not given up Sankalpa cannot become a yogi. But depending on your progress in the evolutionary process of reaching from the lower to the higher, you can choose one or the other.\n\nSo in the third verse we have seen: Arurukshoh muner yogam karma karanam uchyate. If you're still not there, if you're not established in Yoga, then Karma is the means. If I can't balance my mind, I know that I can lose balance when a situation occurs which is not conducive. When things are going well, I act very rationally.\n\nIt's only when things are not going right that I become irrational. The irrationality, Bhagavan says, shows that you have no control over your mind. The situation is affecting you, and you blame the situation. But the root cause is that you have no control over your mind. The mind is taking away the peace in your inner self. Therefore Bhagavan says, keep doing actions without expectations.\n\nThat's your exercise. Continue working on that. Yogarudhasya tasyaiva shamah karanam uchyate -- but one who has balanced his mind, one who has achieved the state of yoga, for him shamah (quiescence of mind) is the means. The mind has no desire, no thoughts of achieving something. He doesn't become thoughtless, but he does not have any goal of achieving something he does not have, because he feels complete.\n\nAll our plans for achieving things are because we feel incomplete. Without my car, I'm incomplete. So the things that make me feel incomplete, I try to acquire from the outside world. When you feel incomplete and you have to get something out of this world -- that's the power of Sankalpa. In your mind you create a situation.\n\nYou really create a scenario that if I have this then I will feel complete. If I come here on any kind of student visa or H1 visa only if I can get green card then everything will be solved. Once I get green card, things will be perfectly fine. That becomes a Sankalpa, an overarching desire. Now, who is considered to be Yogarudha? One who has balanced his mind, who now has control over his mind. Here is the litmus test: not getting attached to sense objects does not mean I do not use sense objects.\n\nBut I use them for utility. I feel thirsty and I drink water. I feel hungry and I eat food. But I don't get attached to them. And I have to have this amras every day. That's an attachment.\n\nEnjoying mango juice is not a problem. Getting attached to the taste is the problem. So Bhagavan said, one who doesn't get attached to sense objects -- he uses them for whatever utility they provide for maintaining his life, but doesn't get attached to them. If they are not there tomorrow, he will still be the same person. This part is even more difficult.\n\nWe can probably get detached from sense objects, but getting detached from my own actions is harder. Therefore we have discussed many times before: retiring is not that easy. Giving up something which I've been doing all my life is difficult. I know it very well because I'm not retired yet. It's very difficult to give up actions which you are performing and getting used to them.\n\nThose actions define myself. The first thing that comes out of your mouth: \"I'm an architect\" -- because that defines who you are. That's your profession. \"Oh, I'm a son of such and such.\" Well, that's your relationship. We continue this inquiry of defining ourselves, and we miserably fail in the end, because everything we use to define ourselves is some kind of relationship, some acquisition, some position -- but not really who you are. That Bhagavan says is attachment to your actions. You call yourself an architect because you're attached to your profession. You call yourself a father because you're attached to your relationship with your. Those attachments are to my actions, not to the sense objects. I'm not attached to my son.\n\nI'm attached to my actions, my profession. That's attachment to action. But someone who has given up that attachment -- that does not mean he does not have relationships or doesn't work. He considers that as part of this world where he has to function. Sarvasankalpa Sannyasi.\n\nThese words come time and again, and therefore we obviously have to understand them as thoroughly as we can. The word Sankalpa comes in our culture all the time. As we discussed last time, when you go to do puja, Panditji will ask you to make Sankalpa -- \"this puja, I'm doing it for such and such.\" The Sankalpa is Samyak Kalpana.\n\nThe word samyak literally means overarching, encompassing everything. That is Samyak Kalpana. When there is an overarching desire in my mind -- \"I want to get this\" -- that's Sankalpa. It is a firm determination that my happiness lies there and I must get it. So Panditji says, when you are doing a puja, you must do Sankalpa, Samyak Kalpana: \"By doing this puja, I shall get this.\" Our mind does that Sankalpa all the time.\n\nThe only problem is it continues to change. Bhagavan said this mind has the capacity to jump from one Sankalpa to another, and that creates a variety of desires. In the Mahabharata, there's a statement which says: Kamah, janami te mulam -- \"O desire, I know your roots. Your roots are Sankalpa. I know that you are born out of Sankalpa,\" the desire which is defining me.\n\nThe Upanishad also says the self is nothing but the identification with desire which I consider to be me. The Mahabharata says: \"O desire, you are born from Sankalpa. Therefore I will never think about you, and you will be destroyed along with your own roots.\" If I don't have Sankalpa, I don't give rise to desire.\n\nThen there won't be any desire. And I can kill the desire. Sarva Sankalpa sanyasi. Therefore, the word Sarva Sankalpa is constantly changing. We constantly change our overarching desire. Today this is what I want to achieve, and then tomorrow it changes.\n\nUnless we curb that urge to create new Sankalpas, I cannot become a sannyasi. So he said, Sarva Sankalpa Sannyasi -- one who has given up all Sankalpas. Yogarudha ta duchyate -- that person is considered established in Yoga. If I feel complete, I will not have a desire to achieve anything overarchingly. I will have needs and I'll fulfill my needs.\n\nI need water because I'm thirsty. I need food because I'm hungry. I need a job because I need to make a living. Those are normal things we do. But when there is a Sankalpa -- \"this is what I need to get so that I feel happy\" -- Bhagavan says that one who gives up that sense of Sankalpa becomes Yogarudha.\n\nIf you find yourself in that situation where you have no desire to achieve anything, Bhagavan said you are Yogarudha at that point. Shamah karanam uchyate -- for such a person, inactivity is the means. In fact, from the scriptural point of view, the time comes when you have to stop your activity. Swamiji says here it is a sin not to act when you are required to act, but it is also equally dangerous if you continue acting when you're not required to act.\n\nAnd therefore we used to have those ashrams: Brahmacharyashram, Grihasthashram, Vanaprasthashram, Sannyasashram. You have to reach a point in your life where inactivity is your goal, and then start working not for the self but on the self. Uddharet atmanatmanam na atmanam avasadayet. It seems like there are two \"me.\"\n\nOne is the \"watching me\" and one is the \"working me.\" The watching me is constantly deciding what needs to be done. It is what we call our own conscience -- we feel this is right. But then my pragmatic thought says, \"No, that may not be very useful, so let's go and do that instead.\" This watching me is my higher self.\n\nConsider that which has a clear vision of what is right and what is wrong, constantly watching me. \"I think I should have a cup of tea.\" There are two \"I\"s -- one who thinks, one who wants the cup of tea. This watching me is the one who can guide you. And Bhagavan said, Uddharet atmanatmanam -- let your lower self\n\n-- the working me -- be raised out of this sansar, this jagat which is constantly changing. Raise that lower, working self by the help of the watching self. Then my own conscience can help me get out of the sorrows of day-to-day life, if I become friends with it, if I listen to that voice. Na atmanam avasadayet -- don't let this working me drown in this world of sorrows and day-to-day rut. Atmaiva hi atmano bandhuh -- that watching me can be my friend, if I allow it to be my friend.",
      "reflection": "\"Uddhared atmanatmanam\" - lift yourself by your own self. This powerful instruction from verse 5 reveals that within you exists both the problem and the solution. There is a \"working self\" caught in day-to-day struggles, and a \"watching self\" that observes with clarity and wisdom. That inner voice of conscience, so often drowned out by the noise of desires and fears, is your higher self ready to guide you upward. The question is: which self are you listening to?\n\nThe teaching about the self being both friend and enemy is startlingly practical. When you have mastery over your senses and mind, the same higher self that could drag you into deeper confusion becomes your greatest ally, empowering every positive step. But when you lose control - when \"I want that coffee right now\" overrides your better judgment - that same powerful self enables your downfall. It is like the fuel in a car: in a controlled vehicle, it takes you where you want to go; in an out-of-control vehicle, it powers the crash.\n\nToday, practice noticing the two selves in operation. When a strong desire arises - for food, for approval, for a purchase - pause and observe. Is this the restless lower self demanding satisfaction, or a genuine need? Then consciously invoke the watching self: \"What would my wisest self advise here?\" This simple practice of self-observation, done repeatedly throughout the day, is the beginning of making the higher self your friend."

      "commentary": "Unlike a car with its user's manual, we are born without instructions on how to live. We experience life's vicissitudes without a so-called user's manual. The Gita has been described as such a guide. So last time we have seen that the advice from Bhagavad Gita is: raise yourself by the self, don't let the self fall. We all really know in life that the only one who can truly help oneself is one's own self.\n\nOnly my own efforts will raise me out of the situation I'm in. But the connotation here is: raise your lower self by the higher self. The self in me which remains constant throughout all these changes of birth and death -- as we have seen in chapter two -- is imperishable, immutable, untaintable. Let that self raise your lower self, which is suffering right now by its own limitations. I can't stand limitations because my true nature is limitless. So the only thing I can do is let my higher self raise my lower self to the same level. Raise yourself by yourself.\n\nDon't let yourself fall. Don't let your lower self go even further down. And that's because it says the higher self is a friend of the lower self. When this lower self is conquered by the higher self, when the lower self starts identifying with the higher self, recognizing its existence, there is something beyond my this day to day life which I live. There is something beyond the life which I consider started at my birth and will end at my death. When I start recognizing this and make that higher self a friend of this lower self, I'll be able to pull the lower self out of its present state of misery.\n\nBut it said the same self, higher self, can be the enemy of the lower self. If my ego fails to recognize that there is something beyond my this limited self, then the same higher self will act as if it's enemy because it will let you go down further and further into this misery. By empowering you to do the wrong thing. Higher self will empower you to do whatever you wish you to do. If the ego goes down into the lower and lower plane of existence, it will be empowered by the same higher self. Just as a car out of control is empowered by the same gas which is in the tank which was making it go straight on the road in a controlled fashion.\n\nThe same gas will power a disastrous wreck. So the advice was clearly: raise yourself by the self. But to do that, you have to have certain qualifications. You have to make efforts to raise your lower self to a worthiness where it can start working with the higher self, start identifying with the higher self. The verses which we discussed -- 7, 8, and 9 -- describe the state of Yogarudha.\n\nOne who has become master of his lower self is Yogarudha. We have seen two stages: Arurukshu and Yogarudha. For someone who is desirous to gain control over his mind, body, and intellect, the advice was karma karanam uchyate -- keep working in this world with selfless motivation and you will achieve that.\n\nBut once you reach that state where you have that control, then shamah karanam uchyate -- at that point, contemplation and meditation become the means to reach the higher level, to achieve the goal of eternal happiness. We want to get out of the limitations. I want to be happy all the time. Bhagavan said it is absolutely possible, but only when you identify with the higher, not the lower. You are the manifestation of the higher.\n\nBut my identification right now is with the lower. As long as I don't identify with the lower, its limitations cannot affect me. It is like when you go to the science museum or some place where there is funny mirror are there. I stand in front of it and I look like I have bloated 10 times than what I am today. Well, as long as I don't identify that image in the mirror, I am fine. Everybody goes in a funny mirror and laugh at it.\n\nBecause they are not identifying with the image they see in the mirror. They clearly identify with the self standing in front of the mirror. That's why they can laugh at it. But anyone who identifies with that distorted reflection cannot laugh. Our situation, Bhagavan says, like we are looking at ourselves in this funny mirror and looking at this miserable self. And now we are in misery.\n\nBut one who identifies with the real self standing in front of the mirror -- the higher self which makes this lower self possible -- is without any miseries. So the one who has achieved that sense of balance over himself has now become Yogarudha. What will he gain? That is what we learned. In the last three verses it says: Jitatmanah prashantasya paramatma samahitah, shitoshna sukha duhkheshu tatha mana apamana yoh. Where do our problems lie? In the three levels we have seen here.\n\nPhysical condition is not comfortable -- the room is too hot or too cold. At the body level, I can be uncomfortable. At a mental level, I feel this is a good time or I don't have a good time -- things are not working out for me. Then there is mana apamana yoh -- honor and dishonor. Intellectually, I feel that people are respecting me.\n\nI have achieved something -- or dishonor, they're not respecting me. All these are causes for pleasure and pain in life. But one who has achieved that Yogarudha state -- one who has recognized the existence of the higher self in him and started aligning himself with it -- for him, Prashantasya Paramatma: his self remains equanimous in all situations because he is not identifying with them. We wrongly understand that one who has achieved this state will not turn on the thermostat, because \"so what if it is uncomfortable.\"\n\nWell, that's sheer foolishness. If I have the facility to adjust the temperature to my level of comfort, then I should do it. People used to ask Swami Chinmayananda all the time: \"Swamiji, you talk about all this detachment, but when you come, people pick you up in Lexus and BMWs and Jaguars. Why don't you go with somebody who has a broken car?\" Swamiji says, \"My friend, I'm a swami. That doesn't mean I'm completely stupid.\"\n\nAs long as there is a more reliable and comfortable vehicle available, why should I choose one which is completely unreliable and uncomfortable? That's a common sense. It has nothing to do with attachment or detachment. So we wrongly perceive that the person who has achieved this state has to suffer, that only then is he considered a true yogi. But the teaching simply says the self in him, the higher self, is prasantasya -- always at equanimity.\n\nIt is not disturbed by outside happenings. Whatever is happening at the body level, I see clearly that it is happening at the body level and let the body deal with it at its own capacity. Whatever is happening at the mental level, I see clearly and let the mind deal with it. Whatever happens at the intellectual level, let my intellect deal with it at its own capacity. But I, the self -- the core of my being -- never get shaken by these happenings in this world.\n\nThat's why I always say there are no riots when it's 102 degrees outside in Richmond. We didn't have people throwing stones at Richmond City Hall. When the temperature hit 102 degrees, we expected that this can happen in summer. Deal with it with the best situation we can create. So we all turned down our thermostat and let the air condition run as best as it can. But we didn't get upset, we didn't have anything to complain to because we knew that it is something beyond my control.\n\nWhen a yogi becomes one with his higher self he sees all the occurring at the mental level, the physical level and the intellectual level occurring at the lower level of existence. But higher self is not involved and does not get attached to it. It's not affected by any of this thing. So that's his fulfillment. Having become Yogarudha, he is no longer disturbed by small things which used to disturb him before. Previously, when it was hot, we complained all over the place. Whenever things were not conducive, we complained. Now I can take it as it is and look at it as a transitory phase happening in my life, in my existence, and not get disturbed by it. The next verse says: Gnana vignana truptatma kutasthah vijitendriyah, yukta iti uchyate yogi sama loshta ashma kanchanah. This is the verse I never understood when I was growing up. I have been learning Bhagavad Gita since I was about 18 years old, and I would think: what is my attitude in life if I become sama loshta ashma kanchanah -- equanimous toward a lump of clay, iron, and gold?\n\nWell, that means I have lost all kind of judgment in life! But it really doesn't say that. In your day-to-day transactions in this world, you do make differentiation between the usefulness or value of one thing or another. But it does tell me that one who has achieved understanding, one who has the knowledge -- Gnana -- one who has learned from others, from books, from teachers, from listening, has received the knowledge. But that knowledge remains bookish until I apply it and make it my own. That becomes Vignana.\n\nThat's what science labs are for. You learn in the classroom that H2O is water. Then you go to the lab and make it on your own with two molecules of hydrogen and one of oxygen, and say, \"That's water!\" Now I'm absolutely convinced. That's now my wisdom.\n\nVignana visishtagnana. That only comes with self experience. Experimenting what I have learned in my own life, I get wisdom. That's why I didn't understand when I was 18. Now at 62, it is very clear, okay? Because I have gone through the experimentation of it in life.\n\nSo it says Gnana Vignana Truptatma Kutastha. Kutastha, I think, comes from the anvil in the smithy shop. The blacksmith is hammering something on that anvil -- both are made of iron. But the one changes its shape while the anvil remains the same. So Kutastha means one who remains unshaken by whatever is happening.\n\nOne who has control over his senses -- Yukta iti uchyate -- such a person is called fulfilled, harmonized, one who has achieved the sense of his self. Sama loshta ashma kanchanah -- he sees the lump of clay, the iron, and the gold as the same. He sees each at its original value.\n\nWhat is the value of gold? What is the value of my house? Well, we put this place for lease or sell or whatever. So what is the value? Well, I may want anything I want.",
      "reflection": "These verses describe the remarkable equanimity of one who has conquered the self: unmoved by heat or cold, pleasure or pain, honor or dishonor. But as Swamiji wisely clarifies, this does not mean the yogi refuses to adjust the thermostat or chooses discomfort when comfort is available. The point is not to suffer needlessly, but to ensure that the core of your being - your inner peace - is not disturbed by external fluctuations. When it is 102 degrees outside, you may feel the heat, but you need not lose your mental equilibrium over it.\n\nThe phrase \"sama-loshta-ashma-kanchanah\" - seeing equally a lump of clay, a stone, and gold - puzzled many seekers in their youth. Does wisdom mean losing all discrimination? Not at all. In practical transactions, gold is still more valuable than clay. But the wise person recognizes that the value is assigned, not inherent. Gold cannot give you lasting happiness any more than clay can. This understanding frees you from the tyranny of constantly chasing \"more valuable\" objects, believing they hold the key to your fulfillment.\n\nReflect today on three categories of disturbance in your life: physical discomforts (heat, cold, illness), emotional fluctuations (good times, bad times), and intellectual wounds (feeling respected or disrespected). Which category most easily disturbs your peace? This is where your practice should focus. The goal is not to become insensitive, but to see clearly that these fluctuations are happening at the level of body, mind, or intellect - not at the level of your true self, which remains the unchanging witness."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter six, Dhyana Yoga Yoga of Meditation. In first five chapters we learned about ourselves. We learned the terms Yogi and sannyasi. So in this chapter we've learned so far that the one who is acting in this world without depending on the fruits of actions is a yogi and also a sannyasi. Because a sannyasi cannot be a sannyasi unless he has given up all the sense of agency. A Yogi cannot be a yogi until he gives up all the Sankalpas Sarva Sankalpa Sanyasi.\n\nSo both reach the same state of becoming equanimous to all the happenings around them. And Bhagavan said, the one who has not yet achieved the state of Yoga, Arudha. So we are seekers, the seeker. The prescription is to selfless actions. Karma Karanam Uchathe. But one, you are established in Yoga then Shamah Karanamuchate then controlling your mind is your pursuit to achieve the higher level.\n\nHow do I know that I have become established in yoga? Once you get detached from your actions and also the sense objects -- when you are completely detached from the world of objects and the world of your activities -- in other words, you are functioning but not having that attachment to it. When you achieve that state, Sarva Sankalpa Sannyasi, there are no aspirations to achieve anything or to accomplish anything. That seems like a pretty dangerous state of mind. But in other words, you know what needs to be done and you will be doing it, but without any anxiety about what will come out of it. When you reach that state, then you are Yogarudha.\n\nBut how do I get to that point? Bhagavan said, let yourself lift yourself. Let your higher self lift this lower self to a level where they both become aligned with each other. Right now my identification is with the lower self, which we have defined as my body, mind, and intellect. This limited being I consider to be me in all my pursuits. I try to achieve happiness through this limited being. But being limited, it is limited.\n\nIt cannot achieve infinite happiness. But I miss that equation: something finite cannot achieve anything infinite. I am constantly pursuing infinite happiness, infinite bliss, an infinite state where there is no sorrow, using equipment which is finite. Once you align yourself with that higher self which is infinite, you will achieve your goal. So let your higher self lift your lower self to a level aligned with it. And then came the caution: that higher self can be your enemy or a friend.\n\nDepending on whether I have control over my self, my senses, my mind. If I have no control over mind and senses, higher self enable me to do whatever my lower self wants to do and then it will be a disaster. So now the higher self is acting as an enemy because it's allowing me to do things which are not good for me. So once I have understood that the higher self is there to enable me to achieve higher goals and align with it, it will become my friend. Once I have achieved that state, what will happen? We have learned that then one becomes in a state of equanimity.\n\nHis self remains same in a Sita, Ushna, Sukhada, Kamana or Pramana. At the level of physical being, at the level of mental being or intellectual being. My connection with the higher remains the same. In other words, that I do not identify with what's happening with my body, mind and intellect. I continue to identify with my higher self which remains as a witness to what's happening. Therefore it is not getting affected.\n\nWhen I see that things are happening to people around me but I am not affected, then I am a witness. I heard a long time ago a definition of recession and depression: when your neighbour gets laid off, it's a recession. When you get laid off, it's a depression. As long as I'm not affected,\n\nIt's a good topic to talk about. So as long as I don't identify with what's happening, it does not affect me. So as long as my self is constantly identifying with the higher self, whatever happening at the physical level, mental level, intellectual level, it does not get affected. Then he will also become one with all beings in their relationship. Gnana Vignana Truptatma Kutastha Vijitendriyah Yukta iti uchyate Yogi Sama Loshta Ashma Kanchanah. He sees everything in the physical world as essentially the same.\n\nHe knows that there is no inherent value in anything. Value is what I assign the value to. As long as I know this is a million dollar Diamond. There is a value because I can sell it. But if I do not know what their value is, it is no different than a costume jewelry. So values are what I assign to it, the world assigned to it.\n\nBut there is no inherent value in anything or being. That's the person with the alignment of the higher self. Then we are saying that even in his relationship, Suhan, mitra, Hari, udasin, madhyas, all different types of people we deal with in our life. Some are friends, some are foes, some are indifferent, some are relatives. But we see them all equally. In other words, they are all manifestation of the same self.\n\nSo this is the state described of a yogi. But we are not at this stage. The prescription is: continue doing selfless actions for the purification of your mind and intellect. When the internal instrument becomes pure, you start seeing your connection with the higher. That inner voice which is so feeble right now, you'll hear loud and clear. How to get there is what the next few verses tell us -- a detailed description of the practices one can follow. Now, last time we had this discussion about whether meditation is for yogis only or for anybody.\n\nAnd there is a question about whether we understand what meditation is. Meditation is the final state. If you take Patanjali's Yoga Sutra, there are eight different stages before you get to the state of meditation: Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana, and Samadhi. We have to go through all these different steps to get to a level where we are ready for meditation. But that does not mean you don't have to start somewhere.\n\nYou have to start at some place, wherever you are in your journey, one step at a time. And then you have to discipline yourself, which is where Yama (restraint) and Niyama (observance) come in. In anything, what really matters is constant practice. When I used to work for large companies, the marketing people, before you go for a presentation, would say, \"Let's have a rehearsal.\" Some of us would feel, \"I've been doing it for years, why do I have to practice?\"\n\nThey say, no, no, Neel, do the rehearsal one time and we are done. Practice, practice and practice some more. Then only you will be able to present it flawlessly when you go there. So in anything, practice, practice and practice some more is the key. Most of us will say, I tried that. And when obviously it's not working for me.\n\nBut how long have you tried? A couple of days. Obviously there is no way to judge what you can achieve if you continue to practice. But how you practice is just as important. We sometimes say that somebody has 10 years of experience, but it may be one year of experience repeated ten times. He never progressed beyond the very first year.\n\nWhatever he learned, he keeps doing for the next 10 years and says, \"I have 10 years of experience.\" So you have to learn how to start in the right manner and then make progress. The next three verses teach us how to start that journey. Yogi yunjita satatam atmanam rahasi sthitah, ekaki yata chittatma nirashih aparigrahah. This is the description of how the yogi should live, in one verse.\n\nNow, the yogi who has established himself is yogarudha. He has already gone through the other things we have talked about. He is not attached to the world of objects. He is not attached to his activities. He reached that state. Now he wants to attain that final connection with the self.\n\nSo he said, let the yogi try constantly to keep the mind steady. Probably half an hour a day. So what about the next 23 and a half hours is I let my mind go wherever it wants to go. So what would be more prominent on your mind? The one which you've done in 23 and a half hours or the one you did for half an hour? Of course, the 23 and a half hours will be predominant on your mind.\n\nWhat will be the nature of your mind, what you do for next 23 and a half hours? So the goal here is to open all 24 hours should be the same. Let the yogi try constantly. Keep the mind steady. Remaining in solitude. Remaining in solitude.\n\nMentally in solitude. You may be in a marketplace, but your goal always remains. How my mind is connected, myself is connected. Swamiji gives a standard example of mother in a child. A mother with an infant child. Child may be in the next room and she is in a kitchen and she is doing whatever she is doing.\n\nBut her mind is completely attuned to the child. Even the slightest noise she will recognize. In those days they didn't have those monitors we have here so that you can put a monitor all over the house. But her mind is so tuned to that baby that other people can't hear. Because mind is constantly focused on where the baby is and what it is doing. A yogi becomes like that he may be doing whatever but his mind is constantly aligned towards his self and the conditions given which will allow him to do this.\n\nHe doesn't consider himself bound by attachment to all the people around him. Yata chittatma -- he is balanced in his chitta and atma, the self and the thinking entity. Nirashih -- without any asha (expectation). This is where we get lost, thinking \"this is maybe not for us; I have too many things to accomplish.\" But nirashih means he does not seek anything to accomplish outside in the world for his happiness. He may be accomplishing a lot, but that accomplishment is not going to give him anything more for his connection to his higher self.\n\nHe's constantly focused on his connection. Therefore he has no other desire -- getting this or that out of this world will not make him more fit to achieve supreme happiness. Aparigrahah -- without possessions. All my possessions are of no value when it comes to my understanding of myself. I may be a billionaire, but happiness cannot be bought with billion dollars. What I'm seeking is infinite happiness.\n\nI have come to the conclusion anything which is finite is not going to give me happiness. Therefore, acquiring things to get happiness. I have come to the conclusion is not a good idea. I may acquire things for other reason. To support my body, my mind, my intellect, my relatives, my friends. For them I'm doing this.\n\nBut not for me to get happiness. I'm not buying happiness by acquiring things. That clear idea is in my mind. My possessing thing is not going to give me happiness. I have come to the conclusion that I have tried this before.",
      "reflection": "These verses offer the first practical instructions for meditation: sit alone in a secluded place, control the mind, be free from desires and possessions. But the instruction \"rahasi sthitah\" - remaining in seclusion - is not merely physical. A mother with an infant in the next room is fully engaged in her tasks, yet her mind is constantly attuned to her child. Similarly, the yogi may be in a crowded marketplace but maintains mental seclusion - an inner focus on the self that is undisturbed by outer activity.\n\nThe condition \"nirashih aparigrahah\" - without expectations, without possessions - challenges us deeply. We tend to believe that acquiring things will make us complete. \"If only I had a green card, everything would be solved.\" But once achieved, new incompleteness arises. The yogi has reached the profound realization that possessions cannot purchase peace. This does not mean abandoning all material support, but rather abandoning the delusion that material acquisition leads to lasting happiness.\n\nToday, examine your relationship with your meditation practice itself. Are you treating it like 30 minutes carved out from the \"real\" 23.5 hours of your day? The teaching here is that meditation should gradually infuse all 24 hours. Start by choosing one regular activity - eating breakfast, walking to your car, brushing your teeth - and practice it with the same quality of focused awareness you would bring to formal meditation. This is how the practice expands from the cushion into life."

      "commentary": "Unlike a car with its user's manual, we are born without instructions how to live. We experience life vicissitudes without a so called user's manual. The Gita has been described as such a guide. We had been discussing chapter six, Dhyana Yoga Yoga of Meditation. We have so far understood that the yogi is trying to achieve a state of mind where he is not attached to either the sense objects or his actions, and he does not have any grand plans for the future. To achieve this state of mind, one obviously has to turn one's gaze to the inner self and stop letting the mind run out to the outer world.\n\nThe nature of the mind is obviously to go after the sense objects because it is receiving the information from the senses, senses, reports to the mind. And mind wants to go out and analyze those experiences in the world of sense objects. For this mind to train to turn inward is the training of meditation. And we have seen that Bhagavan has given a clear instruction of how to start this practice. Obviously anything which we are doing and we want to change it, you have to make it a practice, a habit. I heard somewhere that if you do something seven times, it becomes a habit.\n\nAnd I have personally experienced that if I get up one day at 6:30 and it seems too early the next day, I try a little harder and still get up at 6:30. And then after a while that becomes my normal routine that I'll get up at 6:30. So the mind gradually gets used to what we do in a routine manner, or we do it repeatedly. My mind is a flow of thoughts. In whatever direction we turn it, that's the direction the mind will start flowing into. Right now the mind has been trained since my birth to go out to the outside world and gather information whether that experience is conducive or not conducive, whether it is a pleasant or unpleasant experience.\n\nAnd my happiness or unhappiness right now is defined by my experiences which are either conducive or unconducive, pleasant or unpleasant. Dhyana Yoga is the practice to turn this mind away from this outer experiences and experience the inner self. So so far we have seen that the instruction is given that having lived the life of a selfless activity. In other words, I have now changed my priorities in my life. Where whatever I'm doing, I will be thinking about the greater good. Then I will think about not only practicing this art for making money or making my living, but also how good I can make the others lives.\n\nMy clients will be using these buildings. Whether have I improved their lives. And that will be my motivation in practicing my art. If I train my mind to think that way for everything I do, my activities start becoming more selfless than selfish. More and more I practice my selfless activities. My mind becomes purer and purer and seeing the world outside.\n\nBut I have yet not trained itself to turn inward to see what is the experience of myself. And that's where the meditation come in place. So the instruction we have seen in last few _Verses_ it says such. Establish a place of your own meditation which is steady and firm. Naati uchritam naati nicham that it is not too tall, not too low. And once I've established my place of meditation, I've become comfortable on that asana.\n\nAnd I sit down with my folded legs or any other position which is most comfortable. The whole goal is to make my body so comfortable that my mind does not run towards discomfort of my body. My mind gets used to sitting at that place and realizing that now is the time to contemplate and meditate. I'm training my mind. I'm programming my mind that once I sit down at this place, it is time to meditate. So the next instruction was, what do I do once I sit down?\n\nI sit down, I close my eyes lightly. And then the instructions say tatra ekagramana kutva. Then focusing the mind at a single point, Yatachatta indriya kriyah. That controlling the senses. I'm not letting my eyes to see, my ears to hear, or my skin to feel any touch. And I will be practicing this for the purpose of atma vishuddaye, for purifying my internal instrument.\n\nI keep this goal in mind at the seat of meditation. That I am doing this for my internal the purification of my internal instrument. Antakarana, my mind and intellect, the operating system of myself, which is my mind and intellect. So the next three _Verses_ gives us further instructions into what would be the most appropriate posture to achieve that. So the verse 13 says, Samam kaya shirogrivam dharayan achalam sthiraha. I sat down, I closed my eyes, but I'm trying to focus my mind and I feel the weight of my body.\n\nIt's slouching me down and slumping me down and that distracts me. I have never understood this before. I joined Chinmaya Mission and started hearing and learning about meditation. But I heard Swamiji saying that the most comfortable position will be to sit erect. If you want to sit at the seat of meditation, not only that you have to have a right, right seat, but you have to right posture so that you can sit without any stress and strain or having any discomfort in your body in the posture which is most natural, most natural posture. I now understand this as an architectural principle: if I have a straight column, it will have less stress because I'm transferring all the load on that column straight down to the earth. But if I have a bent column with a load on the second floor at the top of it, that column will have more stress and strain. And I have to design it in a way that it has more reinforcement and all different type of calculations to make sure that the column remains in place. It's a simple fact in structural knowledge: if I have a straight column, it requires less strength because there is less strain from the load imposed on it. This actually applies to our body too, because our body is nothing but a structure, just like any building. When we are sitting down and our backbone is bent, it puts more stress on it to keep itself in place. That stress and strain eventually transfers to my mind, which starts thinking about how to become comfortable.\n\nSo I need to create a posture which is the most natural in nature is to have a straight column. My backbone should be completely straight. So therefore it says Samam kaya shira grivam. Keep the head, neck and the body in a straight line. It's an observation by our rishis that this is the most comfortable position for our self, our body. It will less strain if you work on your posture and all the time make sure that you are sitting straight.\n\nYou will realize it is the most comfortable position, and you can sit in it for a longer period without feeling any stress on your body. This comes straight from Bhagavad Gita: Samam Kaya Shirogrivam -- having your body, neck, and head in a straight line. Dharayan Achalam -- hold it without moving.\n\nOnce again, let's go back to my own architectural training. If I have a column with wind load applied on it and it is moving in the wind -- I learned to my surprise when I started working on high-rise buildings that all high-rise buildings actually sway in the wind, just like a tree moves in the wind.\n\nWe typically think the buildings are stable and they don't move. But all buildings move just like a tree would move in a wind. So in a high rise building which are about 50, 60, 70 stories tall or more, they literally move in a wind just like a tree would move. And I even have heard that people get seasickness on the, on the top floors of high rise, those who are very, very sensitive to movement. Because at the top floor, if you are in a hundred story building or 110 story building and you are on a 110th floor, the movement may be in feet. You know, the building moves several feet from one side to another.\n\nAnd people who are sensitive, most people don't, may not feel it. But some people who are very sensitive start feeling their movement, they develop something similar to seasickness. So if the column is straight, no other force is applied on it, and it's not moving, it has the least stress. But on a high-rise building that will move in the wind, the engineer has to calculate that movement and design for those forces so the column remains steady under wind load. He has to add more reinforcement and strength to keep this column intact under those conditions.\n\nSo once more: our backbone, when it is moving, experiences more stress and strain, and eventually that transfers to our mind. If I want my mind completely relieved of any disturbance, I need to relieve it from any stress coming from my body. So Bhagavan says Dharayan Achalam -- hold this posture of having the head, neck, and body in a straight line, firmly, without moving. That does not mean a stiff posture where I'm trying not to move, but naturally achieving that firmness in a most relaxed manner.\n\nNow I have the seat, I've sat down on it, I've held my body in a firm position, my posture is corrected, my backbone is completely straight. How do I control my mind?\n\nAt one point I'll have to give my mind something to think about, something to focus on. The next line says: Samprekshya nasikagram svam -- gaze at your own nose tip. Somebody will say, \"But Neil, my eyes are closed. How am I going to gaze at my nose tip?\" Well, you're not really seeing; you are trying to focus on it. With your eyes closed, focus your mind at the tip of your nose. You are not seeing it, you are imagining it.\n\nFocusing your mind at the tip of your nose. Dishash cha anavalokayan -- without seeing in the other directions. Our mind has a very imaginative nature. When you close your eyes, the first thing the mind does is, \"Well, I can't see now, but let me imagine what's around me. What if I look to the right? What must be happening?\"\n\nWould I look on the left? What must be happening? What could be behind me and what could be ahead of me? This nature of imagining things, we need to stop my mind to do. Therefore I'm trying to focus my mind at the tip of my nose and not letting it go in all other direction. So the verse 13 has told us how to sit erect, hold the body firm then gaze at the tip of your nose with your eyes lightly closed and not let the mind try to imagine what's on the other side.\n\nIn the next verse say this.",
      "reflection": "The instruction \"samam kaya-shiro-grivam\" - keep the body, head, and neck in a straight line - contains profound structural wisdom. Just as a straight column in a building carries weight with minimum stress while a bent column requires extra reinforcement, your spine when erect allows you to sit for extended periods without strain. The body becomes so comfortable that the mind forgets it, freeing attention for the inward journey. This is not rigid stiffness but natural alignment - relaxed yet upright.\n\nThe practice of gazing at the nose tip with eyes gently closed addresses our mind's imaginative nature. With eyes closed, the mind immediately begins constructing images: What is happening on my left? What is behind me? By focusing attention on a single point - the nose tip - we give the restless mind an anchor, preventing it from wandering in all directions. The instruction \"dishash cha anavalokayan\" - not looking in various directions - applies to mental wandering, not just physical seeing.\n\nThe promise of verse 15 is extraordinary: \"Shantim nirvana-paramam mat-samstham adhigacchati\" - the yogi attains supreme peace that resides in Me. This peace we seek so desperately in the external world simply does not exist there. It is like riding a roller coaster and wishing it would stabilize - the nature of the roller coaster is movement. True stability is found only by stepping off onto solid ground. Today, practice sitting in correct posture for just five minutes, focusing on the breath at the tip of your nose, gently returning when the mind wanders. This small practice, done consistently, is the doorway to that supreme peace."

      "commentary": "Unlike a car with its user's manual, we are born without instructions how to live. We experience life vicissitudes without a so called user's manual. The Gita has been described as such a guide. We obviously have been discussing the Yoga of Meditation. We went through several chapters with the Karma Yoga, then culminating the Karma into Wisdom and then Sannyasa Yoga. And now we are saying Dhyana Yoga, the Yoga of Meditation.\n\nWe have so far seen that all we are doing is for Atma Shuddhi -- the purification of my internal instrument. My mind and intellect are the internal instrument, and that's the only task I have as a seeker: to purify my mind and intellect so that my real self will shine through. Then I will realize who I am -- the peace which I had been seeking all my life.\n\nBhagavan said in the last verse we discussed that you will then achieve Shantim Nirvana Paramam Matsanstham Adhigacchati. In verse 15, it said: having gone through this Yoga of meditation -- how to control your mind, how to sit still, control your body, control your senses, control your mind, and then focus on yourself, focus on Me as your supreme goal -- you will find that peace which you had been looking for all your life. That peace resides in Me, the supreme self.\n\nThe peace I'm seeking in this world does not exist in this world. And therefore me seeking the peace in this world is something like if, let's say for there is a one weekend at King's Dominion, there is a free ride that you can take as many rides as many times, no tickets needed or no attendants are going to stop you from taking that ride over and over again. We go on that roller coaster ride because this is a great chance. I know it's a lot of fun and here it is that there is no restriction. How many times I can take it. So I go on the roller coaster and while I'm going through the roller coaster, I'm constantly thinking, well, if this thing can stabilize, I'll really feel good about it.\n\nBoy, it is going up and down. I can't even predict when it's going to go up and when it's going to come down. If it just stabilizes, I'll feel good about it. But because of my desire to have this fun, I'm not getting off the roller coaster. And after all, I get so engrossed into this, I don't even realize when it stops and starts again. And I'm constantly thinking, if this stabilizes, I may feel a little better about it.\n\nAt that point, some roller coaster guru can come and say, if you really want it stabilized, why don't you get off the roller coaster when it stops next time? So I said, what do I need to do? I said, well, just focus on when it stops. When it stops, you get out and then you'll be in a stable ground, which is what your real place is on a stable ground. That's where you were before. Before you decided you want to have this unlimited fun on this roller coaster.\n\nBecause there is no fee today. There is no restriction how many times you can take it. You say, well, I'll basically take it as long as I can stay there. But in that goal, I forgot that what I'm seeking is stability. That's my true nature. That's what I'm daily living.\n\nBut in that quest for getting this unlimited fun in what I always thought is a great fun, but I did not go there because it cost so much. Now that my chance to do it free, I'm on a roller coaster constantly seeking for the stability which does not exist in roller coaster. Very nature of roller coaster is to go up and down. So some guru comes and said, just focus on yourself. When you see a little stability, that's where the roller coaster stops. And then you will find that stability which you had been seeking all throughout this roller coaster will be yours because it resides outside this roller coaster.\n\nBhagavan says the Santi Nirvana Paramam, that santhi which only gets when you are liberated from this rat of this limited being, trying to seek happiness and peace in this world outside. You will achieve that because your mind and intellect is now pure to experience the joy which resides in the self. And once you unite with that self, Matsangstham Adigacchati, you will achieve that state of mind. And then the last three verses which you've seen, which is 16, 17 and 18. And it said, what we tend to think is, well, I need to live my life as I'm living. But then I need to have like 15 minutes in the morning.\n\nI'm going to meditate, you know, and then I've achieved this state of paramshanti. Well that absolutely is a false notion. To do a meditation, you have to prepare for doing meditation. So how do we prepare for it? The Bhagavan says that the yoga is not possible for people who leave life without any control. I live undisciplined life.\n\nAnd then I say, then I sit down and do yoga. A lot of people have this strong notion that I am living this dynamic life of working for 18 hours a day. But because I have 15 minutes of meditation then I can go on for another 18 hours. Bhagavan clearly says that that's not the reality. You live a life which is hectic and uncontrolled. You will not be able to meditate at all.\n\nTherefore it says: Na ati ashnatah tu yoga asti -- for one who eats too much, Yoga is not possible. In other words, if I'm indulging in sense gratifications, Yoga is not possible. It is also not possible for one who doesn't eat at all, who is completely avoiding any fulfillment for this body.\n\nIt clearly says that torturing my body and senses unnecessarily will not make me any more worthy of meditation than a person who lives a moderate, disciplined life. Na cha ati svapnashilasya -- one who is engaged in svapna (dreaming/sleeping).\n\nDreaming is only possible when you're sleeping. But I can be Svapnashila while I'm waking in this world also, because from the point of Vedanta, the svapna extends from my dream world into the waking world. The waking world is nothing but another glorified dream from Vedanta's perspective. Na cha ati svapnashilasya -- one who is sleeping too much, or not sleeping at all.\n\nJagrato naiva cha Arjuna -- or constantly awake in this world, more engaged in this world, not taking enough sleep. Anything which is extreme is to be avoided, because it will not give you the purity or the control over yourself to focus your mind.\n\nIt's very enlightening that this is not sacred knowledge you only learn from Bhagavad Gita. People learn this on their own when they want to achieve something. We say, \"Tomorrow I cannot do this because I have to wake up early.\" \"I'm not coming to that party, I'm not going to a late-night movie, if I'm serious about what I'm going to do the next day.\"\n\nI saw two interviews on TV by two Bollywood stars whom I probably wouldn't think had ever gone to any school of philosophy -- both basically known for their good looks, like Akshay Kumar and John Abraham. In short interviews, the first thing they both said when asked \"how do you do that?\" was: \"I live a very disciplined life.\" You wouldn't expect to hear that from a Bollywood star, but both said the only way to achieve and maintain their stardom was by living a very disciplined life. \"I don't stay awake after 9 o'clock\" or whatever.\n\n\"I go to sleep by that time, I wake up early.\" Akshay Kumar said his show had to be recorded at six o'clock in the morning -- that was the only time he would be available. He won't stay up late. He said, \"I'm very disciplined.\"\n\n\"I do this exercise daily.\" And I heard the exact same thing from John Abraham's interview somewhere. I wouldn't really think they have great knowledge of Bhagavad Gita or that somebody told them. They themselves figured out that the only way to maintain success is by living a disciplined life. Anyone who is serious about success eventually finds out that it is only possible through moderation. So Bhagavad Gita says, if I'm not clear about that and think meditation will be a panacea that solves all my problems -- like saying \"I take Lipitor, so I can eat anything I want\" -- that's not a smart idea. Anytime a doctor gives me medication and says, \"Neil, you have a cholesterol problem, here's the medication,\" the medication only works well if I also control my diet and make other lifestyle changes. In anything I want to achieve, moderation is the key. Bhagavan says, first of all, yoga is not for people who live an extreme life.\n\nThen the positive message: Yukta Ahara Viharasya, Yukta Cheshtasya Karmasu, Yukta Svapnavabodhasya Yogo Bhavati Duhkhaha. Now you might ask: did I really forget why I'm doing this yoga? Why did I start all this in the first place? If I have to live this moderate life and give up all the fun I used to have at parties at night, why do I even start? You are doing it, my friend, to get rid of your duhkha.\n\nAll the sorrows which you have, you want to get rid of them. There's not a single moment in life where I can say, \"This pain is great, it really feels good.\" Unless you've heard this joke -- it's pretty famous. Someone was banging his head against the wall.\n\nWhy are you banging your head against the wall? He said, because it feels good when I stop. Just to get that feeling of good. When you stop, you don't bang your head against the wall. You want to get rid of any pain that you have in your life, physical, mental, intellectual. You want to get rid of as quickly as possible in the easiest way.\n\nBhagavan says, Yukta Ahara Viharasya -- first, the person who is moderate in ahara, consumption of sense objects. Vihara means moving around, going on vacations, cruises. But sometimes that becomes more exhausting than work, doesn't it? Recreation also must be in moderation. I used to watch movies when I was a student because in those days that was the only entertainment -- sometimes three shows in a row: 12 to 3, then 3 to 6, then 6 to 9.",
      "reflection": "The Gita's teaching on moderation in these verses is remarkably practical and timeless. \"Naty-ashnatas tu yogo'sti na chaikantam anashnatah\" - yoga is not for one who eats too much, nor for one who eats too little. The same applies to sleep, recreation, and all activities. This is not a call to austerity or self-denial, but to wisdom and balance. Interestingly, even successful Bollywood stars have discovered this principle through experience - that discipline and moderation are essential for sustained achievement.\n\nWe sometimes develop a dangerous misconception: \"I live a hectic 18-hour workday, but my 15 minutes of meditation will fix everything.\" This is like saying, \"I eat junk food constantly, but my daily vitamin will make me healthy.\" Bhagavan clearly states that an extreme, undisciplined life cannot be compensated by brief periods of meditation. The whole of life must become regulated - \"yukta-ahara-viharasya, yukta-cheshtasya karmasu\" - balanced in eating, recreation, and action.\n\nThe reward for this moderation is profound: \"Yogo bhavati duhkhaha\" - yoga becomes the destroyer of sorrow. Why are we undertaking this practice? Not to punish ourselves, but to eliminate the suffering that pervades our lives. Today, honestly assess one area of your life that is out of balance. Are you sleeping too much or too little? Eating mindlessly or obsessively? Working to exhaustion or avoiding necessary tasks? Choose one small adjustment toward moderation. Remember: every aspect of life either supports or undermines your capacity for inner peace."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 6, Dhyana Yoga, Yoga of Meditation. And that happiness can only come if we become detached from our attachment to this world of objects and beings. But we still have to work in this world. And therefore the simple definition given of a person who has achieved that detachment, whether you call him a yogi or a sannyasis, Anasritaha Karma, Falam Karyam Karautiya. One who acts in this world without depending on the fruits of actions, he is acting, but he is not dependent on what will come out of my actions. That anxiety is not there.\n\nOne who has achieved that state of mind control. He is a yogi or he is a sannyasi. That's as simple a definition. Then he says to achieve that state, obviously you have to go through several disciplines and practices. And all this is all about controlling your mind. Because all that we consider a happiness or unhappiness, sorrow or pleasure is all a mental state.\n\nWhen that mental state is controlled, we can control whether we are in a happiness or unhappiness state. The practice given is called meditation. This meditation is not just a physical act of sitting down cross-legged and focusing on some idea, but regulating the entire life. We have seen the prerequisites of what needs to be done. It is about one who regulates his life in all aspects.\n\nHe does not eat too much, he does not eat too little, he does not sleep too much, he does not sleep too little. Even in his activities, he does not exert himself too much. In other words, everything in moderation. All that really means is you apply the appropriate amount of effort -- not too much, not too little. It's like tightening a bolt. If you tighten too much, it's a problem. If you don't tighten enough, it's a problem.\n\nOnly time it works perfectly is when it is appropriately tightened. So every activity of our life should be regulated to a point. But then your mind has to be focused or controlled and how do we control mind? And we have learned that the very nature of the mind, very definition of mind is mind is nothing but a flow of thoughts. Mind is like a river. Water does not make a river, but a flowing water in one direction makes a river.\n\nSo mind is nothing but the flow of thoughts -- in our case, flowing in many directions. These thoughts are channelized into many channels, and each channel assumes that at its end there is happiness. If we channelize them to one particular point where happiness really lies -- which scripture says is within yourself -- that exercise of reverting your mind's flow of thoughts from outward to inward is called meditation. To practice that, we have been given a prescription and detailed instruction.\n\nSit down erect so there is no discomfort in your body. There is no discomfort in the environment around you. And then focus your mind onto yourself. That peace which you experience during that inward journey is yourself. And as the meditators of all ages have said, once you experience that peace, you will like to experience that over and over again. And then with that constant practice, you reach a point where that peace become permanent.\n\nThe last thing we have seen is: Yada viniyatam chittam atmani eva avatishthate -- when the mind rests in the self. Once the mind has found its final destination, where the peace lies, it does not want to go anywhere. If somebody says, \"Where do you want to buy a house in Richmond?\" -- once I've decided the West End is the right place, I'm not going to look around in Mechanicsville or Chesterfield, because I have already decided that the right place is the West End. Once the mind decides that the real resting place where peace is, is in myself, it will not go anywhere else.\n\nIt's just the very nature of the mind. So it says, once that mind rests in the self, free from longing -- Nihsprihah sarva kamebhyah -- all the desires up till now were for what? Everything I have done since I understood who I am, till last night or this morning, is to get happiness, to feel happy, to get peace in life. And this peace is so elusive. The more you go after it, like a mirage,\n\nthe more it runs away from you. Once you find a place where it is not a mirage, you will establish yourself in that. Once you establish in that, there is no longing for any objects and desires. Then it is said he is united -- that is Yuktah. We are like lost children. We are lost in this sansar, this mela, and we are seeking our own place, where our family is, where we came from. When we get united with that place, we find peace.\n\nA child will be lost in India festival and is crying profusely. No matter what you tell him, give me chocolate. Nothing works till find my parent. And as soon as he finds his parents nothing can attract him but that peace. When you find after that there is nothing else you will look for. So our nature is peace and therefore we are seeking peace.\n\nIf our nature is not peace, we wouldn't be seeking peace. My nature is health, therefore I am seeking health. So anything happens, I run to the doctor, run to whatever, fix me quickly, as quickly as you can. Everybody says antibiotics, read about antibiotics and all the perils of taking antibiotics. The first thing I go and ask my doctor is give me the antibiotics as quickly and as powerful as possible. I want to get rid of whatever that is not health as quickly as possible.\n\nBecause my real nature is health. My real nature is not unhealthy. So I am always seeking what my true nature is. My true nature is peace. And everything else in this world is giving me un peace. Once I unite with that peace, I am considered Yuktaha.\n\nThis simile used is just as in a windless room the flame of a lamp does not flicker, it remains steady. Yatra uparamate chittam nirdam yoga sevaya yatracha eva atmana tmanam pasyan atmani tushyade. So when the mind restrained by the practice of yoga attains quietude by when seeing the self by the self he satisfied by the self always seeking all our life is some satisfaction, some peace. We tried everywhere else but it was never complete. It may come for a for a while as I said. As soon as I get that, the key of my first BMW in my hand, a complete peace in my mind.\n\nAll that I want to achieve. And the next moment the agitation starts again. As soon as he tells me what the insurance would be for this guy. But once I found that piece where? By the self satisfied by the self. So yogi, once he practices this yoga to find his peace and he found it, he is now satisfied that the final state.\n\nThese four verses basically describe what yoga is all about. We have this whole notion about yoga being sitting down in a lotus position. But those are all practices to control your body, mind, and intellect. All agitations in my life come through my body, mind, and intellect. Either my body is not healthy, or my mind is not healthy.\n\nMind is okay, but ideas are not coming -- the intellect is struggling. Once those are controlled and peace comes, then I am a yogi. Sukham atyantikam yat tat buddhi grahyam atindriyam, vetti yatra na cha eva ayam sthitah chalati tattvatah. This is like somebody who has gone to Hawaii and is explaining the joy. \"I had been to all these different destinations for vacation.\" He said, \"No, no, Neil, forget about all of that.\"\n\nYou just go to Hawaii one time and that's the end of the story. You wouldn't like to go anywhere else. So he explained and see, when you go there, they have all these things. After that you never have to take a vacation anywhere else. Sukam Atyantikam Yattad When a yogi feels this infinite bliss, one who has experienced this bliss in his meditation, he said that's infinite bliss. That bliss is not something which comes and goes.\n\nSo what we worry about is: this is too much trouble in the first place. I can't wake up early in the morning as everybody says I should. Then I have to sit down in a particular place. Then I have to control my mind, which is not controllable in the first place. And then someday I'll find a little peace and it will go away, and I'll have to start all over again. But the real meditation -- once a person has experienced that infinite bliss -- can be grasped by the intellect. Buddhi grahyam atindriyam -- it's not something promised that can never be proved.\n\nSwamiji used to say, \"In our business there is no danger because we can bluff our way out and nobody can catch us.\" But no, Bhagavan said that's not true. You will be able to grasp this peace through Buddhi, the intellect. But that Buddhi is the pure Buddhi -- the intellect that is not clouded by Rajas and Tamas. We are also very smart at finding what is right and wrong for us. But all that right and wrong is colored by our vasanas.\n\nWhat my Buddhi says is good for me or not good for me is all colored by my experiences, desires, and vasanas. The intellect which is pure will grasp that infinite happiness. Vetti yatra na cha eva ayam sthitah chalati tattvatah -- once Buddhi grasps that infinite peace, he will never be shaken from that ultimate reality. Tattvatah -- he will never be able to think the other way around. He will never be able to think happiness lies outside.\n\nBecause his Buddhi has grasped that the reality where the bliss is so that's a state which only you have to achieve one time. Once you achieve that, nobody will be able to shake you off that realization. Once you realize what is reality. Once you wake up from your dream and you realize what the reality is. No matter how much you convince yourself that no, no, no. The reality was the one which was experiencing the dream.\n\nIn my dream I was Bill Gates' boss. No matter how much I convince myself that I am actually Bill Gates' boss, that's not going to work. Because once my Buddhi has grasped that what I was experiencing was nothing but a dream, as a waker I will not be able to go back to that. In the same way, the Upanishad says that the waking world is a dream. We have assigned values to all these objects in our waking world as if they are happiness.\n\nOnce you wake up from this, you realize that there is no value outside for your own bliss or happiness. And from that you cannot be shaken off. Yam labdhva cha aparam labham manyate na adhikam tatah -- having experienced that, you will realize there is nothing else greater to be achieved. All my life, everything I have done is to find some peace, some happiness.\n\nWell, here is ultimate happiness and ultimate bliss. So there is nothing to be gained if I suddenly wake up and realize that my forefathers used to own the entire real estate in Richmond.",
      "reflection": "The beautiful simile in verse 19 - \"yatha dipo nivata-stho nengate\" - compares the controlled mind to a lamp in a windless place that does not flicker. Our minds currently flicker violently because the winds of desire constantly blow through them. One thought leads to another: \"I'm chanting Rama, which reminds me of Ramlal who owes me money, which reminds me...\" The cascading associations carry us far from our intended focus. But when we calm the winds of desire, even briefly, the flame of awareness becomes steady.\n\nVerse 21 promises \"sukham atyantikam\" - infinite, never-ending bliss. This is not exaggeration but precise description. The happiness we experience from external achievements - getting the car keys to our first BMW - is real but fleeting. The next moment, worries about insurance arise. The bliss discovered in meditation is different in kind, not just degree. It is \"buddhi-grahyam atindriyam\" - graspable by the pure intellect but beyond the senses. It cannot be seen, touched, or heard, yet it is more real than any sensory experience.\n\nThe promise of verse 21 is crucial: \"Sthitash chalati tattvatah\" - once established in this truth, the yogi never strays from reality. This is like waking from a dream. No matter how vivid the dream was - even if you were Bill Gates' boss in it - once awake, you cannot convince yourself the dream was real. The waking state has superior claim to reality. Similarly, the one who has tasted this infinite bliss through meditation can never again believe that happiness lies in external objects. Today, sit quietly and ask: \"What would it mean to find a happiness that never ends?\" Let that question draw you inward."

      "commentary": "Unlike a car with its user's manual, we are born without instructions how to live. We experience life vicissitudes without a so called user's manual. The Gita has been described as such a guide. So those of you who remember, we were on chapter six two weeks ago and we discussed verses 25, 26, and 27. Chapter six is Dhyana Yoga. The first six chapters, as we have discussed many times, describe the \"you\" part of that.\n\n\"You are That\" -- Thou art, Tattvamasi -- in the Upanishads. The \"you\" part is you and I, who we are. The first six chapters culminate into Dhyana Yoga: who I am, which I can't understand right now, I can reflect on and find through the self. This false notion -- \"this is me, this body, mind and intellect\" -- to undo this, I have to contemplate on that self. Once I find myself by myself and become content in myself, then my yoga is complete.\n\nThat's what we have seen. The verse says: Atmanam pashyan atmani tushyati -- seeing the self by the self,\n\nI'm satisfied in myself. That's the goal of life. I want contentment, I want happiness which is everlasting. I looked at, I sought that outside. I finally find in myself. And once I find that in myself, I'm satisfied, content.\n\nSo the first six chapters told us who we are, what our shortcomings are, and how to overcome them, culminating in meditation. We came across a new definition of yoga in the last few verses: Duhkha samyoga viyoga is yoga -- disassociation from the association with sorrows is yoga. Right now we actually associate with our sorrows, and therefore we are sorrowful. I have an ache and pain in my leg and I think \"I have pain.\" I start associating with this pain -- somebody pricks me and that's my pain.\n\nBut when a doctor or nurse is ready to give me an injection, I'm already prepared for that. I disassociate myself from that pain so I can tolerate it without any problem, because I have already disengaged and said, \"That's not really pain, not something unnatural happening to me.\" That attitude of disassociating yourself from the association with pain -- pain exists, sorrows exist, but my association with that ends. Bhagavan says that's Yoga: Duhkha Samyoga Viyoga.\n\nAnd therefore Duhkhena guruna api na vichalyate -- even when the greatest sorrows come from the outside world, they seem like the greatest sorrows from my perspective, but those are just the natural occurrences of this world. They happen just as the laws of nature predict. The yogi who has disassociated himself from sorrows is without any disturbance. He has found himself by himself and finds this infinite joy and happiness in that.\n\nThe next three verses go along with verse 24: Sankalpa prabhavan kaman tyaktva, manasaivendriyagramam viniyamya samanthatah. You have traveled that journey from ignorance about yourself to understanding what's not right in your internal instrument, the mind and intellect. Purifying it through Karma Yoga, contemplating on that self, I have come to this point: I have given up all the desire-prompted actions, all the desires prompted by the Sankalpa Shakti of my mind. I may have normal desires like \"I'm thirsty and I want water.\" That's not Sankalpa Prabhavan Kama -- those are not born out of my fanciful imagination. I'm thirsty, so I need water.\n\nBut the Sankalpa Shakti in my mind is my mind projects a future, imaginary future and say if I do this then I can do this and then I will have this and then I'll gain this and then I'll be a millionaire. Well that's my Sankalpa Shakti. And what I do is before I start a plan to achieve that goal, my mind has already moved on to another goal. But I can also do this and then do this and then do this and then I can be a billionaire. So before even I start any concrete actions to achieve my goal my mind has erased that goal and gave me another goal. So I'm constantly chasing the goal which is not there.\n\nBy that time I start working on my goal. My goal has moved away. So I'm aimlessly moving. And you see that Sankalpa Shakti. All the desires prompted by this fanciful nature of my mind. When I give up asesata without leaving anything behind.\n\nIn other words, I will live in the present, work in the present, and all my goals which are grounded in my life, I'll work towards. That's not what the Gita says you should give up. It says give up Sankalpa Prabhavan -- all the desires prompted by this fanciful nature of the mind. Manasaivendriyagramam viniyamya -- and then controlling all the senses, which are my instruments to transact with this world outside.\n\nMy sense of sight, sound, touch, smell, taste -- I control them by my mind. The senses really do not have any power until the mind plays tricks with them. If I control my mind, my mind is now steady because it is inwardly focused on myself, and I control all the senses through my mind. Then the verse we have seen: Shanaih shanaih uparamet buddhya dhriti grihitaya, atma sanstham manah krutva na kinchid api chintayet.\n\nHe says this is not going to come overnight. You have to constantly practice that. Then gradually Sanai, gradually you will have a control over this by the firm intellectual intellect which is now purified by all the things which we talked about in the first six chapters. Selfless actions, you know, and all these things. And now purified my intellect which is a pure intellect is seeing the reality. What is right and what is wrong.\n\nWhat is really good for me and what is not good for me. With that intellect I. I gradually get the control and get this peace and say Atma Sanstam Manaha Kratva. Mind is established in the self. It's not running outside to fulfilling these fanciful desires. It established in the self. Kincit Apinachintayat Yogi.\n\nSuch a seeker will not be thinking about anything but the self. In other words, now I clearly see the difference between I and the instruments of my transaction with the world. This body, mind and intellect are just instruments which I use to transact with this world. That duality only exists in my mind. Myself and your self and his self is one and the same self. This duality has created these sorrows for me.\n\nThis Establishment in the self gives me the contentment which I had been seeking for. And now comes the prescription. Because we think that once I have figured out and I'm established in meditation, that everything is over. I have now achieved what I'm going to achieve. And after that there's not really much efforts left for me. So the next verse, Bhagavan reminds us that this is a constant effort to control your mind.\n\nIf you think the mind is going to turn towards yourself and that is the end of the story that is going to remain there, you are mistaken. The very nature of mind is restless. The mind is called mind because it is the flow of thoughts. And a flow of thoughts. Keeping in one direction is going to be difficult. So therefore you need to be vigilant in your intellect and seeing what the mind is doing.\n\nAnd controlam ashiram very nature of the mind is. It is restless, unsteady. You can't think of the one thing for a long period of time. I'm thinking about something and suddenly I hear something and my mind just runs away. I'm thinking about doing something and my mind sees something and it runs away from that. It is the very nature of the mind to use the senses as its gateways and runs away.\n\nAnd I say, don't try to punish yourself for that. But remember that your job is to bring that mind back to where it needs to be. So you have to train this mind and tell this mind this is not right. You're trying to meditate, you're trying to study. You're trying to do something which you decided is good for you. This is what you want to do.\n\nBut hearing something, listening something, seeing something, mind runs away. Don't get discouraged. But bring the mind back and say, you should be doing this right now. So Bhagawan says, yatha yattaha nisharati manaha chanchalam astiram tathaha tathaha niyamya etad atmani evam vasam nayat. Whenever, whenever mind does that. That time you bring the mind and establish back into yourself by yourself.\n\nBring your mind, turn it towards yourself and then say prasantamanasamhinam yoginam sukhamuttamam. Why are we doing all of that? Why do you want to control the mind? Just because I want to punish my mind, say no, no. What you're looking for was happiness, Sukham. You are looking for a happiness which is everlasting.\n\nTherefore it's uttamam, not the regular ones which we get for a While and then it goes away. Well, we had been good. We had been going through this all our life and we are not very happy about it. We want something everlasting. Give me something which I never have to return back to the. I want something permanent happiness.\n\nBhagawan said the only permanent happiness comes from Prasantamanah. By a quiet mind is the only source of joy and happiness. Agitated mind cannot give you any happiness. I may be telling you the greatest news of your life. But if your mind is agitated, you won't listen to me. I may be giving you the greatest gift you can receive.\n\nBut if your mind is agitated, you won't even see it. So it is the mind which decides whether I am happy or not. So what is the quality of the mind which is in happiness? The mind which is quiet gives me happiness. And there is a Prasantamanasam Hienam Yoginam Sukha Muttamam. The yogi who has been striving and seeking the self.\n\nOnce he finds his self established the mind in it, his mind now becomes quiet. This quietness in the mind gives the Sukham Uttamam the greatest happiness. Sensing Upeti Santa Rajasam. You know why he gets the happiness? Shanta Rajasam Rajasa activity. You know this Sattva Rajasantamas the very nature of the mind is to be Rajasa want to run away.\n\nWhen you make this mind quiet out of his habit of running away into say stay quiet. You know it gives the happiness. Brahma Bhutam Akalpasham with this practice of meditation when I purified my mind and intellect. Now I have trained my mind to be steady which is contrary to its own nature of running away. This quiet mind removes all my sin or kalmasam and the Yogi becomes without any sin. And the sin is nothing but the impurities in my internal instruments mind and intellect.\n\nI'm purified by those impurities. I now realize that myself and the supreme self is one and the same self. So I become Brahma Bhutam. I've now identified myself with the eternal self which is all pervading, an almighty and omniscient and omnipotent. Then in my previous case I identified myself with this limited self which is limit in my body. A limit of my mental capacity and my intellectual capacity.\n\nAll my problems are because my identification with this limitedness. Now because I have now identified myself with the supreme. All my problems have dissolved into a permanent peace.",
      "reflection": "A new definition of yoga emerges in these verses: \"Duhkha-samyoga-viyogam yoga-samjnitam\" - yoga is the disassociation from the association with sorrow. We currently associate with our sorrows so completely that we become them. \"My leg hurts\" becomes \"I am in pain.\" Yet when a nurse prepares to give an injection, we instinctively disassociate - \"This is expected, temporary, for my benefit\" - and the same pain becomes bearable. The yogi extends this disassociation to all of life's inevitable sorrows.\n\nVerse 24 addresses \"sankalpa-prabhavan kaman\" - desires born from the projecting power of the mind. Our Sankalpa Shakti is remarkable: it projects imaginary futures and convinces us that happiness lies there. \"If I do this, then I can do that, then I'll achieve this, then I'll be a millionaire... no wait, I could also do this other thing and become a billionaire!\" The mind creates goals, then erases them before we even begin working, replacing them with new fantasies. We are aimlessly chasing targets that keep moving.\n\nVerse 23 offers essential encouragement: \"Sa nishchayena yoktavyo yogo'nirvin-nachetasa\" - yoga should be practiced with determination and without depression. The spiritual path requires resilience. Many give up quickly, saying \"I tried meditation; it doesn't work for me.\" But how long did you try? A few days? Would you expect to master any skill - playing piano, speaking a language, running a marathon - in a few days? Today, renew your commitment to practice. Choose one sankalpa-born desire that you will consciously set aside - not forever, but for today. Notice how the mind protests, then settle it and return to presence."

The senses really do not have any power until the mind plays tricks with them. If I control my mind, my mind is now steady because it is inwardly focused on myself, and I control all the senses through my mind. Then the verse we have seen: Shanaih shanaih uparamet buddhya dhriti grihitaya, atma sanstham manah krutva na kinchid api chintayet.\n\nHe says this is not going to come overnight. You have to constantly practice. Then gradually -- Shanaih, gradually -- you will gain control over this through the firm, purified intellect, which has been purified by all the practices we talked about in the first six chapters: selfless actions and so on. And now this purified intellect, this pure intellect, is seeing reality as it is. What is right and what is wrong.\n\nWhat is really good for me and what is not good for me. With that intellect I. I gradually get the control and get this peace and say Atma Sanstam Manaha Kratva. Mind is established in the self. It's not running outside to fulfilling these fanciful desires.

So therefore you need to be vigilant with your intellect, constantly watching what the mind is doing. The very nature of the mind is chanchalam asthiram -- restless, unsteady. You can't think of the one thing for a long period of time. I'm thinking about something and suddenly I hear something and my mind just runs away. I'm thinking about doing something and my mind sees something and it runs away from that. It is the very nature of the mind to use the senses as its gateways and runs away.\n\nAnd I say, don't try to punish yourself for that. But remember that your job is to bring that mind back to where it needs to be. So you have to train this mind and tell this mind this is not right. You're trying to meditate, you're trying to study.

But bring the mind back and say, you should be doing this right now. So Bhagawan says, yatha yattaha nisharati manaha chanchalam astiram tathaha tathaha niyamya etad atmani evam vasam nayat. Whenever, whenever mind does that. That time you bring the mind and establish back into yourself by yourself.\n\nBring your mind, turn it towards yourself and then say prasantamanasamhinam yoginam sukhamuttamam. Why are we doing all of that? Why do you want to control the mind? Just because I want to punish my mind, say no, no. What you're looking for was happiness, Sukham. You are looking for a happiness which is everlasting.\n\nTherefore it's uttamam, not the regular ones which we get for a While and then it goes away. Well, we had been good. We had been going through this all our life and we are not very happy about it. We want something everlasting. Give me something which I never have to return back to the. I want something permanent happiness.\n\nBhagawan said the only permanent happiness comes from Prasantamanah. By a quiet mind is the only source of joy and happiness. Agitated mind cannot give you any happiness. I may be telling you the greatest news of your life. But if your mind is agitated, you won't listen to me. I may be giving you the greatest gift you can receive.\n\nBut if your mind is agitated, you won't even see it. So it is the mind which decides whether I am happy or not. So what is the quality of the mind which is in happiness? The mind which is quiet gives me happiness. And there is a Prasantamanasam Hienam Yoginam Sukha Muttamam. The yogi who has been striving and seeking the self.\n\nOnce he finds his self established the mind in it, his mind now becomes quiet. This quietness in the mind gives the Sukham Uttamam the greatest happiness. Sensing Upeti Santa Rajasam. You know why he gets the happiness? Shanta Rajasam Rajasa activity. You know this Sattva Rajasantamas the very nature of the mind is to be Rajasa want to run away.\n\nWhen you make this mind quiet out of his habit of running away into say stay quiet. You know it gives the happiness. Brahma Bhutam Akalpasham with this practice of meditation when I purified my mind and intellect. Now I have trained my mind to be steady which is contrary to its own nature of running away. This quiet mind removes all my sin or kalmasam and the Yogi becomes without any sin. And the sin is nothing but the impurities in my internal instruments mind and intellect.\n\nI'm purified by those impurities. I now realize that myself and the supreme self is one and the same self. So I become Brahma Bhutam. I've now identified myself with the eternal self which is all pervading, an almighty and omniscient and omnipotent. Then in my previous case I identified myself with this limited self which is limit in my body. A limit of my mental capacity and my intellectual capacity.\n\nAll my problems are because my identification with this limitedness. Now because I have now identified myself with the supreme. All my problems have dissolved into a permanent peace.",
      "reflection": "The word \"shanaih shanaih\" - gradually, gradually - in verse 25 offers tremendous encouragement. This is not a path of sudden transformation but patient cultivation. With a pure intellect (buddhya dhriti-grihitaya), you gradually withdraw the mind from its outward rushing and establish it in the self. The key is not to expect overnight results, but to trust the process and continue. Like learning to drive a car - initially overwhelming, eventually automatic - the practice of steadying the mind becomes natural through repetition.\n\nVerse 26 acknowledges reality with compassion: \"Yato yato nishcharati manash chanchalam asthiram\" - wherever and whenever the restless, unsteady mind wanders, bring it back. This is not a verse of condemnation but of practical instruction. The mind WILL wander - that is its nature. Your job is not to prevent wandering but to notice it and return. Each return strengthens the faculty of awareness. Don't punish yourself for wandering; celebrate each return. You are training a wild horse, and every gentle redirection is progress.\n\nThe reward described in verse 27 is the purpose behind all this effort: \"Prasanta-manasam hy enam yoginam sukham uttamam\" - supreme bliss comes to the yogi whose mind is peaceful, whose rajas (restlessness) is subdued, who has become one with Brahman and is free from sin. The sins mentioned are the impurities of the internal instrument - the vasanas and tendencies that drive us toward wrong action. When these are purified through meditation, the yogi realizes that the individual self and the Supreme Self were always one. Today, practice this: when your mind wanders during any activity, gently whisper \"return\" and bring attention back. Do this ten times and notice how the quality of your experience changes."

      "commentary": "Unlike a car with its user's manual, we are born without instructions how to live. We experience life vicissitudes without a so called user's manual. The Gita has been described as such a guide. We had been discussing chapter six, Yoga of Meditation. So far we have seen up to verse 27 that the goal of meditation is to make the mind steady. The mind currently in my present situation is flickering and running away in many, many directions.\n\nAnd therefore the whole idea of making the mind steady seems very, very difficult for me. So we have seen the practice how to meditate, how to make this mind steady, Choose a place which is conducive, make it a practice every day, make this as a habit, same place, same position, controlling your body from not disturbing you, make it most comfortable, sit down and focus your mind. Now this is where we find ourselves in difficulty focusing the mind on one goal and one target. We have heard this simile that the mind, when it is like a mind, like a lamp, when there is a wind in the room or in the place where the lamp is placed, the flame flickers. And depending on the nature of the wind, flame may flicker very heavily or may flicker just a little, depending on how much wind there is. The mind works in a similar way.\n\nDepending on my vasanas, depending on the desires in my mind, this mind will be running after many, many thoughts and one thought will lead to the another. Swamiji used to say, I'm trying to chant Rama and the Rama. The word Rama reminds me of Ramlal who has borrowed money from me. And then we go on and on and on. But this obviously can be controlled, as we have seen that if you calm down this wind of desires, at least at the time of sitting in the meditation, that you have trained your mind not to think about other things and you focus on that one thought, then mind will be steady. And as we have seen that by a constant practice, the yogi can make his mind steady.\n\nAnd once that mind becomes steady, he will Recognize the peace within himself from whatever the cause. The restless and the unsteady mind wanders away from that. Let him restrain it and bring it back under the control of the self alone by practice now it is becoming easier for me. I guess I am speaking for every seeker who is practicing that practice makes man perfect. We have heard this before. We have learned in our life that anything I continue to practice, it becomes easier.\n\nSomething which I practice over and over and over again. It reaches a point that there is no effort required. Something like driving a car. When I was first learning how to drive a car, obviously I had all kinds of problems. And I may have said this before that I used to complain to my cousins who were trying to teach me how to drive a car in Africa. I had gone from India.\n\nI had never driven a car in India. I probably took some lessons in India before I was living for Zambia. And in India it was very easy to get a license. Nobody even bothered with it. I really knew how to drive, but I got a license now I went to Zambia. And then I really had to drive.\n\nSo learning from my cousins how to drive, they kept telling me, \"Keep your car steady, keep your car steady.\" And I complained, \"How can I keep it steady when I'm sitting on one side of the car? If the steering wheel was in the center, it would be much easier!\" But that was just an excuse because I didn't know how to control the car. And then more and more I practice driving the car. It started becoming easier and easier.\n\nAnd then I reached a point where driving a car requires no efforts. I sit down in the car, put the key in the ignition, can be thinking about every other thing except driving the car. But I will be driving properly in a right lane. And whatever the appropriate thing I have to do for driving the car. But I do not have to put any more efforts in. Comes automatically and naturally.\n\nAs soon as I sit down in the driver's seat, my mind takes over. My subconscious mind takes over how to drive this car. Meditation is like that. If I practice over and over and over again to steady my mind under one thought and one thought alone. As soon as I sit at the seat of meditation, my mind will know what to do and it will control itself automatically. And Bhagavan says that such a yogi experiences the supreme bliss, that peace which I had been seeking all my life.\n\nAnd I had been trying to achieve that in many different ways. To acquire things, to make sure everything is secured, my future is secured, my Family's future is secured. However, I never experience that peace in my mind. Now at the seat of meditation, I can experience the supreme bliss. Bhagavan said, the supreme bliss verily comes to this yogi whose mind is quiet and peaceful. His passions are quietened.\n\nNow he is free from sin. And we have seen the sin is nothing but impurities on my mind. Impurities are the impressions on my mind which makes me think that this I will do and that will make me happy. Once my mind is steady and is focused on one thought, who I am, what is myself, all these impurities are purified and I achieve that bliss. And the term used is Brahma Bhutam akalmasham. He becomes one with the Brahman all pervading self and he becomes free of all sins.\n\nContinuing in this thought, the next three verses talks about the yogi who has with continued practice has made this as his own nature that the Yunjan Evam Sada Atmanam Yogi Vigada kalmashah. Again we are talking about in Yogi who has become freed from all his sins. Now we sometimes makes an argument that on one hand, the law of karma says that if I have done something, I have to pay for it. Or if I pay for it, in a sense, if it was a negative act, if it is a positive act, I will get the reward. And then here it says that by meditation I will become free of all sins. How do we reconcile the idea of the law of karma which says you cannot escape from your actions?\n\nHere it says just by meditation I can become free from all my sins. Well, the law of karma simply says that my actions will have equal and appropriate reactions. If I've done something inappropriate, I will have to pay the consequences. However, the sins here are not the consequences of the actions. Sins are the impressions on my mind. A negative impression on my mind from any event or experience is a sin.\n\nThese negative impressions are the ones which are causing me to do more wrong things. I have seen somebody making money by illegal means. That impressions, that thought or the observation leaves a wrong impression that if I have to make money, it seemed like this is the only way to do it. That negative impression is a sin. Now that sin will make me act in an inappropriate manner. Then I will also try to achieve the wealth by what I thought was the only way you can achieve wealth by inappropriate means.\n\nThe wrong impression on the mind made me do the wrong things. Now I have to face the consequences of those wrong things. However, if I have cleaned up my mind from all these impressions, then I'm free of sins. I may still have to face consequences of past actions, but no more wrong actions will be generated from impressions on my mind. A yogi constantly controlling his mind reaches a level of purification where there are no negative impressions, and therefore there is no cause for him to react inappropriately. So Yunjan Evam Sada Atmanam Yogi Vikatha Kalma Sahar. The Yogi always engaging the mind. Thus in the practice of yoga, freed from sins, he now Sukena Brahmasp Samsparsam Atyantam Sukham Ashnate. He now easily enjoy that infinite bliss. Because his mind, no matter whatever is happening in his life, in his situations, he is constantly in the thought of that supreme Brahman that he is enjoying that bliss at every moment.\n\nSo he has become Brahma sans person. He is in touch with Brahman in all situation and therefore he is experiencing that bliss in all situation. Sukham Atyantam Ashnute and he enjoys this Sukham, this happiness which is infinite. I have tried in my life all other things, but I never got it. Scripture says that Yogi who meditates and makes his mind steady. Just by that simple act of making the mind steady, he will be in touch with the Brahman.\n\nThe supreme reality will be freed from all his limitations. So the yogi has now experienced the supreme bliss. What would be his vision? Sarva Bhutastham Atmanam, Sarva Bhutani Cha Atmani, Ikshate Yoga Yuktatma Sarvatra Samadarshanah. Now, with his mind harmonized and in touch with the supreme reality, he starts seeing that same reality residing in all beings, and also seeing all beings residing in that supreme reality. We had seen this paradox before in Bhagavad Gita: is Bhagavan within me, or am I in Bhagavan? Is God within me, the limited being, or am I, the limited being, in the God-self which is unlimited?\n\nBoth are correct. It depends on your viewpoint. Is the room space in the universal space, or is the universal space in the room? When you see the room space as an individual space, it is nothing but part of the universal space. But when you see the space in the room as part of the universal space, that universal space is in the room. I, the limited being, am in the self of the Bhagavan who is manifesting and pervading everywhere. But when I look at it from my limited perspective, I see that I, the limited being, have the presence of Bhagavan in me.\n\nSo I start seeing that he is in all the beings. I also see that all the beings are in that supreme self. Icsate Yoga Yukta Tatma. Thus the Yogi who is one with the yoga, one, the Yogi who has become one with his Self, he sees this Sarvatra Samadarshanaha everywhere He sees that unity. He sees this presence of the Lord equally in all beings and things. Same Lord which resides in Me is also residing in everything else that manifests in this world.\n\nSuch a vision makes this yogi become one with this world, acting as if this world is nothing but his own extension. Yo mam pashyati sarvatra sarvam cha mayi pashyati, tasya aham na pranashyami sa cha me na pranashyati. Bhagavan now says: Yo mam pashyati sarvatra -- when Lord Krishna in Bhagavad Gita refers to himself in the first person singular, Swamiji points out every time that he is not speaking as Devaki's son or Yashoda's son, but referring to himself as the supreme being pervading everyone. The yogi who sees Me everywhere -- anything I see, I recognize as nothing but Bhagavan's manifestation. Sarvam cha mayi pashyati -- I also see God's presence in everything. Nothing could have been possible without His presence.",
      "reflection": "These verses reveal a seeming paradox about sin and karma. If the law of karma says we must face consequences of all actions, how can meditation free us from all sins? The key distinction is that sins here are not the consequences but the impressions (vasanas) that drive future wrong actions. Seeing someone make money illegally creates an impression that this is how wealth is gained. That impression is the sin - it will prompt future wrong action. When meditation purifies these impressions, no new wrong actions arise. You may still face consequences of past actions, but you stop generating new problematic karma.\n\nVerse 29 describes the vision of unity: \"Sarva-bhuta-stham atmanam sarva-bhutani cha atmani\" - seeing the Self in all beings and all beings in the Self. This is not poetic metaphor but literal description of realized experience. Just as the space in one room is the same space as in every room, and all rooms exist within infinite space, the consciousness in you is the same consciousness in all beings, and all beings exist within that one consciousness. The apparent diversity is real at one level, yet underlaid by absolute unity.\n\nThe beautiful promise of verse 30 - \"Tasyaham na pranashyami sa cha me na pranashyati\" - \"I am never lost to him, nor is he ever lost to Me\" - assures us that this relationship with the Supreme is mutual. Once you see the Divine everywhere, the Divine is always accessible to you; once the Divine recognizes you as its own, that bond can never break. Today, practice seeing the same life force - the same consciousness - in three very different beings: a family member, a stranger, and a plant or animal. Can you sense the common thread of awareness that animates all three?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter six, Dhyana Yoga, Yoga of Meditation. In chapter two, Sankhya Yoga, we learned how to differentiate between the self and non self. Self is that which is Ajaha, which is unborn and imperishable. Nayanam Chindanti Sastrani Nayanam Dhati Pavaka. That which cannot be destroyed by anything, by weapons or fire or water or air. That's the definition of the self.\n\nAnything which does not fit into the definition is non self. So everything which I consider myself today does not fit into that definition. I was born, I have a birth date and I may have a death date. And everything which I know about me and my possessions fall into the same category. So it all falls into non self. So my world is populated by non self only.\n\nAll that I consider myself so far as me is also non self. My body has a birth and death. My mind has beginning and end. My intellect has beginning and end. So everything that I associate myself and considered to be me is non self. So now the search for the self.\n\nHow do I find myself? So we have learned up to chapter five how to purify the mind and intellect. In other words, how to prepare yourself for this search for running a marathon. You first have to prepare for it the whole period of training. So the second chapter onward we had this clear instruction how to prepare your mind. So once that mind is prepared, which we call Yoga Rudha, one who is now prepared to take on this journey for the search of the self.\n\nSo chapter six we started that journey. How to find the journey once the mind is prepared. When it becomes sinless, that the word we constantly keep using in every language that you wash your sins. In other words, the mind is cleared of all the impurities. We learn the mind is nothing but the thought channels. A thought occurs, second thought follows that same thought.\n\nThird thought now follows the second thought. It is now creating a channel. Those channels are created which has become my mind and it is all going outwards. I'm thinking about something other than me now the same Mind I have to turn towards me the self. So everything I have learned so far is about non self. All my education, all my contemplation on what is good and what is bad, all that is about non self.\n\nSo now I have to turn towards myself, the self. That's chapter six, Dhyana Yoga, Yoga of Meditation -- how to prepare yourself and position yourself so that you can start that inward journey. We have seen the clear instruction that once you have prepared your mind and purified it of all the sins, you start this journey of Dhyana Yoga. Constantly doing that search, you will come to a point where you will find that bliss.\n\nFrom verse 28 onward, it says the yogi is always engaging the mind: Yunjan evam sada atmanam yogi vigata kalmashah -- one who is freed of all sins.\n\nIn other words all the impurities of the mind. Mind which has tendency to see wrong things or going in a wrong direction that I have now adjusted the mind focuses on the right thing, clearly sees this is non self and searching for the Self that Sukena Brahma sans Parsam. Very easily it enjoys the contact with the Brahman. He easily can understand what the Self is. So clear goal here is to do inward search about what is the self is all about. When do I consider that my search has yield some results?\n\nThe next one is Sarva Bhuta Stamatmanam Sarva Bhutani Chaatmani. When I start seeing that self which I'm searching as the real self, not the non self is not only residing in me, but residing in all beings searching for myself. In tone I found the eternal self which is residing all beings and Sarva Bhutani Ch' Aatmani and I see the all beings are in the Self. My standard example, all the houses, all the buildings, I see the space. But then I also see that all the buildings are in the space because the space is all pervading. I was searching for the space for my own room once I realized the nature of the self.\n\nI realized that space is the same in all the buildings in the world. And all the buildings are nothing but in that all pervading self. Once that awareness takes place, then I realize I am now truly understand what the nature of the space is. Space is not something which I create as an architect, not something I can buy from Lowe's or Home Depot. I can only buy material to condition my space. Space is universal and all pervading.\n\nOnce that understanding takes place about the self Bhagavan said he will say sarvatra samadharsanaha. Now he can see the equality everywhere. Now he sees the connectivity everywhere. Yomam pashyati sarvatra sarvam chamay pashati tasya ahamna pranasyami sachamena pranashati. So here comes basically an assurance. Is it something that one time I understand in meditation that I have suddenly and then next day I go to work and I forget all about it?\n\nOnce you have that understanding of all pervading self, that connection with yourself will never get broken, will never be separated. Once I understood the nature of the space, the space is all pervading. These are all conditioning. The buildings we create, the things which are in the space, then my understanding of the space will never go away, no matter what I'm doing. Yomam pashyati sarvatya. The one who sees me everywhere, Sarvamchyamay pashyati.\n\nAll the being, all the things, he sees me in it. Now, as Swamiji says, every time Krishna uses the word \"me,\" he's referring to this supreme self. The big \"I\" is what he is referring to. The conditioned \"I\" is the small \"I,\" as we call it, and the big \"I\" is the unconditioned \"I.\" So when Krishna says \"me,\" he's referring to the unconditioned \"I,\" which is all-pervading.\n\nYoma M. Pasade sir, one who sees me in all things and all things in me. Because now there is no differentiation between the self and the non self. Even the non self was nothing but the part of this. If something is all pervading, there is no space left for anything else to exist. It's only I'm limited. There is a space for other people.\n\nIf I buy all the real estate in Richmond, can you buy anything else? No, there's no nothing left for you to buy. It's only when I leave out a parcel and say I don't want that, then you can come and buy. That when I have recognized myself is all pervading, there is nothing left for anything else to exist. But now I have a vision now of the equality in this plurality. So yomam pasyati sarvatra sarvam chamayi pasyati tasya ahamna pranayami.\n\nFor him I never get separated. Once that vision takes place, you are never separated from it. Once I wake up from my dream, I never get separated from the waker. Both dreamer and waker are now connected to the waker. Dreamer also remembers that I am the waker I was dreamer, now I am a waker. Same dreamer is now waker.\n\nThe waker knows \"I am the waker who was dreaming.\" Having woken up, I don't go back to the dreaming state. Once I'm established in my waking state, I never get separated from it till I go to sleep again. Similarly, once that understanding takes place that myself is nothing but the all-pervading self, I never get separated from myself. The verse says \"sa cha me na pranashyati\" -- and now comes the assurance from the all-pervading Lord: I will never get separated from him.\n\nThat relationship is dual relationship. I have relationship with him and he has relationship with me. It is not a one-sided love. If I liked her, but she never knew I exist -- I say, \"I will never leave you,\" but she says, \"I don't even know that you exist.\"\n\nI, the conditioned self has now recognized that I'm nothing but the manifestation of the me of the supreme self. The supreme self knows that I am not conditioned in this body mind. So this relationship is mutual relationship. Both exist in their own perspective. The supreme self exists from a perspective of the macrocosm. And my conditioned self exists in a perspective of the microcosm.\n\nThe room space exists as a. We can be meeting here on Sunday morning. If I say room space does not exist, only universal space exists. Go and meet in a Louis Ginter garden same as meeting here. No, we have to come here. This is where we meet.\n\nIt does exist, but it is nothing but the manifestation of this supreme space. In the same way, my conditioned self exists as an ego identifying with this conditioning. But it clearly knows that this is purely an identification with conditioning, for the convenience of transacting with other conditioned selves. So the next verse says: Sarva bhuta sthitam yo mam bhajati ekatvam asthitah. Once we've established ourselves in this unity, having seen what the self truly is -- my search was to understand: if this body is my non-self, this mind is my non-self, this intellect is my non-self, then what is myself? I found that the consciousness which is not conditioned by this body, mind, and intellect is myself. That's why in meditation the whole goal is to not be aware of your body, not be aware of your thoughts or your intellect. Because intellect can become a hindrance in understanding. The more I consider that I'm pretty smart, the more I do dumb things. The more I give up my idea about my intellectual superiority,\n\nthe more I learn about myself. So Bhagavan said, the one who is Ekatvam asthitah -- the one who is now established in the unity of all things -- has realized that my conditioning and your conditioning are very different. You are not me and I am not you. You have your own limitations, I have mine. But the essence which makes me who I am, and the essence of who you are, is one and the same.\n\nThe self in you and self in I is one and the same. That unity I have found. We constantly search commonness. We come across a new person. We don't try to find how different we are from each other. First thing we try to find what is common among us.\n\nI say, I am from Richmond. Oh, I am also from Richmond. Okay, we have one commonness we found. Then we gradually say, okay. Where do you come from? Well, I come from Surat.\n\nOh, I'm also from Surat. More we find commonness, more we feel comfort. Then we are not worried as much about the differences which we have. The differences drop more common things. We find the people whom we love, all the negative things about them. We don't pay attention to our children, our grandchildren.\n\nThey are mischievous, laugh it off. We feel good about it. We say, how cute it is. Somebody else do that to you. Because we found something common. So the first search for every human being or every being is to find commonness among ourselves.\n\nOnce we find more things common, more identification occurs. First in the college I saw her. Then I found out she takes the same chemistry class I do common. Then I found out she comes from the same town I come from. More things I found common, more I identify with her.",
      "reflection": "Verse 32 offers a profound standard: \"Atmaupamyena sarvatra samam pashyati\" - one who sees equality everywhere through the analogy of the self is the supreme yogi. What is this analogy? I know that I want happiness and freedom from suffering. Through self-examination, I recognize that this same desire motivates every other being. Thus I understand others by understanding myself. This becomes the basis for true compassion: I would never do to others what I would not want done to me, and I naturally wish for others what I wish for myself.\n\nThen comes Arjuna's honest doubt in verse 33, which mirrors the doubt of every sincere seeker: \"I do not see how this yoga of equanimity can be maintained, owing to the restlessness of my mind.\" This is not a lack of faith but clear-eyed self-assessment. Arjuna has listened to all the teachings about steady minds and seeing sameness everywhere, and his experience tells him: my mind is not like that. It constantly chases finer things - Marriott over Super 8, not Seven-Eleven coffee once a better brand is discovered. How can such a mind ever become stable?\n\nThe beauty of this passage is that Arjuna voices what we feel but may be too embarrassed to admit. His honesty opens the door for Krishna's practical response. Today, be equally honest with yourself. Where do you find the teachings beautiful but impractical? What specific aspect of your restless mind seems most untameable? Write it down. Naming the obstacle is the first step toward addressing it. Remember, Arjuna is not rejected for his doubt - he is answered with understanding and solutions."

      "commentary": "We have been discussing Chapter 6, Dhyana Yoga, Yoga of Meditation and Contemplation. So far we have seen in chapter 6 that Bhagavan has emphasized the quiet mind. The basis of all the practices is the mind. As long as you can control the mind, you can become a yogi. Bhagavan had said Samatvam Yoga Uchyate -- equanimity is yoga. In this chapter he also says Duhkha Samyoga Viyoga is Yoga.\n\nThe detachment from the attachment to pain is Yoga. We have a natural attachment to pain; our mind goes towards pain more than it goes towards other things. Another way to look at it: detachment from all objects which have the potential to give me pain. This is what we try to do in life -- avoid all the dangers, protect ourselves from any potential danger. But if you can detach yourself from all potential dangers, which actually includes all sense objects in this world -- all sense objects have equal capacity to give me pleasure as they have the capacity to give me pain.\n\nSo therefore, if I really want to detach myself from all pains, all potential dangers of getting pain, I have to avoid all sense objects. So in verse 27, Bhagawan has concluded his teachings. Prasantamanasamhi enam yoginam Sukha Muthamam. That supreme bliss which I am seeking all my life. I am looking for permanent happiness. I don't want temporary happiness, I want permanent happiness.\n\nBhagawan saying that happiness is available to a yogi who has achieved this supremely quiet mind. Upeti Santarajasam Brahmabhutam or Kalmasam. Supreme bliss comes to this yogi whose mind is peaceful, whose patience are quietened and he does not have any rajas in Brahma Bhutam or Kalmasam. He has become sinless. There is no impurity on his mind. It has become Brahman Brahma Bhutam.\n\nHe recognizes that his own self, the ego, is none other than Brahman. This synchronization of the ego with Brahman is the ultimate goal -- to achieve that final state of supreme happiness, permanent bliss. But the basis of all that is prasantamana. It all boils down to whether I can have this mind completely quiet, completely under control. In verses 28 through 32, Bhagavan has described the yogi who has achieved this state of becoming Brahman. He sees that self in all beings and all beings in the self.\n\nHe will have both perspective at the same time that he sees that consciousness in me. But I'm also in the consciousness. Pot space is within the spot, but pot is in the space also. That dual perspective, if I can have simultaneously, I can synchronize these two perspectives. Bhagavan said that comes only when the Yogi has achieved this Siddhi of quietening the mind and becoming Brahman. He sees sameness everywhere.\n\nHe never gets separated from the self, the self never gets separated from him. Once the pot space realizes that the space outside me is no different, then the space within me never gets separated from the main space. When my ego recognizes that myself, the consciousness in me, is none other than the consciousness everywhere. So right now we cannot imagine that consciousness can be anything outside living beings. But Bhagavad Gita time and again tells us that consciousness is all pervading. We are all existing within the consciousness.\n\nThis world is created out of that supreme self. There is no other material was available to create this universe other than the self alone. And because that yogi has achieved this state, he sees sameness of the self in all beings. Now he has achieved a different reason. Our vision right now is to live in this world by identifying the differences. So the way we transact in this world is if I can detect differences, then I can differentiate things one from another.\n\nTable is not chair, chair is not table. Because they will both look completely different from each other. Different characteristics. But I can also see probably the sameness if both are made up of wood. That sameness when a person sees, Swamiji very cleverly puts it in the biblical term of that that person. Now because this is the sameness, he loves others as he loves his own self.\n\nI don't see any difference between doing something for me or doing something for others. It's basically one and the same thing. Now I also won't do anything to others which I don't want others to do to me because of the sameness that I detect in all things and beings. Up till now I was seeing only differences and that's how I lived my life. By detecting differences and protecting myself from what I don't find conducive and then engaging myself in what I find conducive. But now I don't say anything conducive or unconducive.\n\nBut sameness is my central vision. And Arjuna has been very quietly listening to this and he has come to the conclusion that the basis of all this is Prasantamanah supremely peaceful mind. And therefore he actually verbalize doubt we have in our mind while learning Bhagavad Gita whether it is at all possible. Arjunava Yoyam Yoga TV this yoga that you just described which can be achieved only by quiet mind. Samyana Madhusudana of the sameness that you have described. The the yoga which you described which requires that I see sameness in everything and every being.\n\nWe discussed the importance of the words used in our scriptures. All the names used for Krishna or Arjuna are strategically placed. Madhusudana -- the slayer of the demon Madhu. In this life, we get attracted to things which are sweet for us, things which are nice and comfortable. But attraction in the end creates all my sorrows. If I don't get attracted to them in the first place, I won't have the problems they are capable of giving me.\n\nKrishna as Madhusudana is the remover, the destroyer of this attraction to comfortable, pleasant things. But Arjuna says, \"I don't see that happening. My mind always goes to finer things in life. I find Marriott is better, so I stay at Marriott, not at Super 8. This is the nature of my mind.\"\n\nMy mind always gravitates towards finer things and avoids painful, uncomfortable situations. I don't think that's going to change, because the very nature of the mind is ever-changing. The mind constantly flows in various directions, following whatever the sense organs report to it. For example, when I was only experiencing Seven-Eleven's coffee, my mind was satisfied with Seven-Eleven's coffee. I remember when we used to practice bhajans in our youth group, we'd invite a violin player named Subhas. As soon as he arrived, we had to send somebody to get his coffee from Seven-Eleven. We couldn't offer him coffee at home -- \"Oh yeah, Subhas is here, go get his coffee from Seven-Eleven.\" Because for him 7 limits coffee was ultimate. The mind is chanchala -- as long as it has not experienced something better, it may stick to this. But as soon as it finds something better, it's going to move on to the next thing and then the next thing. Chanchalatva sthitim sthiram -- therefore I do not see this as a long-lasting situation, even if I practice everything that you taught me in this chapter about meditation.\n\nFind a quiet place, sit down comfortably and focus on one point. Then once I focus on one point, if your mind runs away, bring it back. I may do it for 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes. But what is after that? After that my mind is going to do exactly what it was doing before I sat down from meditation. So therefore, O Krishna, this is wonderful discourse.\n\nBut I don't think this is possible to achieve that permanent steadiness Prasantha Manasam which you have described in verse 27. This is a very bold and daring question because he's directly telling Krishna that this teaching is not practical. \"It sounds very good, it has good aesthetics, it's pleasant to hear. But I don't see how to apply it in my life. I know how my mind works, and it's not going to stay in one place as you require.\"\n\nI think every one of us without exception feels exactly the same. We practice meditation -- how many minutes? We count meditation in minutes! But Bhagavan said it has to be a permanent situation. Your mind should be steady all the time. Chanchalam hi manah Krishna, pramathi, balavad dridham -- he said, \"I'm not giving you this argument just to make an argument.\"\n\n\"But I know the nature of the mind, my mind at least. Chanchalam hi manah Krishna -- this mind is always going in different directions. Pramathi -- it's very turbulent. Balavad dridham -- very strong and firm. Once my mind gets attached to an object, it's very difficult to remove it. If I start thinking about drinking coffee, I won't be able to concentrate on what I'm doing till I get a cup of coffee.\"\n\nBecause the mind is very strong. I have to get up and get a cup of coffee. You know, I can focus on whatever I was doing before. Then I put the coffee in that warmer I keep on my desk. Then I'll forget about it. After an hour I realized that I got up, went and got a cup of coffee.\n\nThe coffee was not really needed because I didn't even remember to drink it. But at that time the mind was so attached to the coffee that I had to go get a cup. Swamiji explains here that the word Krishna comes from the root Krish, which means to uproot. Krishna is the one who uproots all these attachments from my mind. So Bhagavan Ved Vyasa very strategically placed this name. Arjuna has not addressed Krishna as Krishna casually.\n\nChanchalam hi manah Krishna -- this mind is not only all over the place and going everywhere, but it's very turbulent, very difficult to control. And dridham -- when it gets attached to something, it's very difficult to disengage it. Vayoh iva su-dushkaram -- not just dushkaram (difficult), but su-dushkaram (very difficult). I consider control of this mind as difficult as controlling the wind. Right now we have a prediction of a hurricane hitting the upper east coast. All you can do is get out of its way.\n\nThere is nothing you can say will prevent the hurricane from hitting New York or Long island. Divert it towards the sea. None of that is in our power even though we are super power. Only thing you can do is get out of its way. So this mind is as difficult to control as wind. And therefore, O Krishna, I don't think it is possible.\n\nEven if I control my mind temporarily, permanently it is not possible. Therefore this yoga is not practical.\" Bhagavan then answers this question. We can learn a technique of how to win an argument. If we are debating or negotiating and somebody makes a point, and you flatly reject it, that person will become even firmer in his opinion.\n\nHe'll say, \"I don't agree with you,\" and that will continue. Nobody will win. So Bhagavan first agrees with Arjuna. He said, \"You are right.\" The first thing you do is agree with your opponent. \"No doubt, you are not wrong, Arjuna.\"\n\nYou are not making argument just for the sake of making an argument. But your argument is very, very valid. That mind is difficult to control. This is a very commonly known fact. Mind is not easy to control.",
      "reflection": "Arjuna's description of the mind in verse 34 is vivid and relatable: \"Chanchalam hi manah Krishna pramathi balavad dridham\" - the mind is restless, turbulent, strong, and obstinate. Once attached to an object, it clings stubbornly. You must get up for coffee, even if you forget to drink it afterward. Controlling such a mind seems \"vayoriva su-dushkaram\" - as difficult as controlling the wind. When hurricanes approach, all our technology is helpless; we can only step aside. Is the mind equally untameable?\n\nKrishna's response in verse 35 is masterful. First, he agrees completely - \"Asamshayam mahabaho mano durnigraham chalam\" - without doubt, the mind is difficult to control. This is wise counsel for any disagreement: acknowledge the valid point before offering a different perspective. Then comes the prescription: \"Abhyasena tu Kaunteya vairagyena cha grihyate\" - through practice (abhyasa) and dispassion (vairagya), it can be mastered. Like circus animals trained to perform remarkable feats, like wild waters tamed by a dam to generate power, the very energy that makes the mind turbulent can be harnessed for spiritual awakening.\n\nVerse 36 offers realistic assessment: \"Asamyatatmana yogo dushprapa\" - yoga is difficult for one with an uncontrolled self. But \"vashyatmana tu yatata shakyo'vaptum\" - for one who strives with a controlled self, using proper methods, it is attainable. The key is not extraordinary ability but consistent effort with the right approach. Today, choose one area where your mind is habitually uncontrolled - perhaps checking your phone, perhaps negative self-talk - and apply both abhyasa (repeatedly redirecting attention) and vairagya (reducing the pull of that habit). Small victories build the confidence that larger mastery is possible."

      "commentary": " Shri Purohit Swami did not comment on this sloka\n\n 6.39 My Lord! Thou art worthy to solve this doubt once and for all; save Thyself there is no one competent to do so.\n\nSo we had been discussing Chapter 6, Dhyana Yoga, Yoga of Meditation. And obviously this is the conclusion of all the discussion we had about ourselves, who we are, what we consider ourselves to be, what we should be considering ourselves to be and how to get there. Right now I'm identified with this limited being called me, my body, mind and intellect. Chapter two said, your goal is to identify with the one which is imperishable. Then we have talked about how to do this through Karma Yoga by doing greater good selfless activities to purify your mind and intellectual so that it starts seeing the reality as is without coloring it through your vasanas and desires and aspirations and goals. And then when I go through that process, we had been told how to now train your mind to not go outside.\n\nSo wherever our mind goes, that's where our attachment goes. That's where identification is. My mind goes to my leg. And therefore my identification is more stronger with the body at the time. Nothing, no great ideas are important that time. Look, my leg is hurting.\n\nLet me tell you about theory of evolution. So wherever a mind goes, that's where my identification is. Mind has now tendency to go out in this world and attach do many things create new attachments every day. So we learned that the goal is now to withdraw the mind, make it inward towards yourself and attach it to yourself. When we get to that point, what will be our experience and we have Learned in verse 29 says Sarva Bhutastam Atmanam Sarva Bhutani Chaatma. Right now I think this is me.\n\nI am in the center of my world. You are in the center of your world. She is in the center of her world. He is in the center of his world. And whenever world collides, that's our relationship. Sometimes they overlaps in a pleasant way and we have friendly encounter.\n\nSometimes they collide very violently and we have conflicts. When my goal and your goal is to achieve the same object, then we are on a collision course as we see in the debates last night, in the very first debate when there are 15 candidates, Donald Trump said, Ted Cruz is a good guy. He is not capable, but he is my friend. Gradually yesterday, he is a liar. He is a liar, nothing but a liar. They are both going toward the same object and they are on a collision course.\n\nSo our worlds are separate and they come and collide with each other in various ways because we all have different worlds. But once the mind is turned towards inward, Bhagavan said, you will find that the self which you call yourself is not only just yourself, but the same self in all the beings. There are not too many different selves, the one self expressing through all the beings. So therefore, Sarva Bhutastam Atmanam I see that this same self is residing in all the beings. What I consider my consciousness is the same consciousness for you and him and she and her. In Sarva Bhutani Ch'.\n\nAatmani not only that, I will also see that the self is not in the beings. Actually, the beings are in the self. Our standard analogy, the this space is in this room. The next door room has its own space. So this room space and that room space have some relationship. They belong to the same building.\n\nSo they are basically related to each other more friendly way. So this space and that space, how did I create them? By putting a partition between in the space, the one space. I put a partition created two space. Now did I really divide the space or I put a partition in the space? I actually put the partition in the space space remaining what it is, I just put a partition in.\n\nSo now is it the space within the partitions or the partitions are within the space? Those of you who have been attending Gita class for a long time know that the partition is in the space. This room used to be much larger partition. The same way, when I start visualizing that all these buildings in this world are actually in the space, not that the space is in the building. So when I turn my gaze towards myself, not only I find that my self is something other than this body, mind and intellect, but the same self is expressing through all the body. All the beings and all the beings are nothing but in the space.\n\nBecause the self is all pervading, just as the space is all pervading. So no matter what building I create in, no matter where on this planet or in another universe, it's still the same space. Iksate Yoga Yukta Tma, Sarvatraha Samadharsanaha One who has become the Yoga Yukta. One who has mastered the yoga. Yoga is to connect one who has mastered that connection of removing this identification from this outside world to inside. Sarvatra Samadarsana.\n\nHe becomes equanimous in all his vision. His mind is at equanimity. No matter what the situation is, he sees the same reality. The goal is to reach a stage where you start seeing that myself is the same as yourself. Yourself is same as his self and herself. And now all beings are nothing but the expression of same self.\n\nSo Arjuna had a doubt. This looks like a pipe dream to me. This looks like something far fetched somewhere. Because the very goal is to turn the mind towards itself. Detaching it from all the attachments it has. That really does not seem like a very viable proposition.\n\nSo get a doubt and say, I don't see this happening. This mind is so chanchal then so unstable that it is like trying to control wind. We all know that controlling wind is not something in our hand. No matter how much technological advances we are. When hurricane comes, all you can do is just watch on tv. But you cannot really control.\n\nYou can say, let me now turn the hurricane's path. So the mind is like that hurricane. Typically our mind is in a turbulent shape. It's not easy to control. Then Bhagavan said, that's correct. That mind is Chanchala Nasthir but Abhyasena.\n\nBy constant practice it can be tamed. The circus animals, they are tamed to do some amazing things. Elephants standing on two legs, you know, Dog jumping through fire. By constant practice even this mind can be tamed. The circus animals can be tamed. Your mind also can be tamed by practice and Vairagyana and by dispassion.\n\nMore you detach from outside. More you detach from your body. More you detach from your intellect. Mind is free to go and attach to the self. More I am as I consider me today. More difficult it is for mind to go and attach it to the self.\n\nHe said Abhyasena in Vairagyana, two pointers given by Bhagavan. Mind cannot be tamed. Bhagavan said, no, it can be. Don't underestimate the power of your mind. That it's Pramathini. Even any powerful thing also can be tamed.\n\nSo we Talked about the hydro power Water, when it is flooding, has a great capacity to create destruction. The same water can be tamed into a hydro dam and create energy. So the same mind which has this tremendous energy to take you away from your goal, that same energy can be harnessed and cultivated to find yourself. Bhaiya Vyasayana vairagya. The two pointers Bhagwangya. So it dispelled his doubt.\n\nNarjuna has a different doubt. So he says, and these doubts are very universal. These doubts are universal. In the path of seeking the truth, every seeker comes to seek doubt. First thing we hear is this chapter is great, but meditation is not easy. So Bhagavan said, okay, if you are really serious, keep trying.\n\nKeep trying and keep trying and try and try again, boys. You will succeed at last. You know, you will continue trying and you will achieve that. Now is another doubt because we know that this life is limited. Just looking at all the things which is happening. We have one of our friend died last week.\n\nBiswanath Basu went to India. He wrote back saying his father went to surgery: \"Thank you very much for prayers.\" And yesterday he sent a note saying his father passed away. So people feel they may have very little time left. \"Neil, finish all the podcasts\" -- what do we want to do? Quickly move on. Now Arjuna, in verse 37:\n\nAyatih shraddhaya upetah -- \"I have complete faith. I have faith that this is right, this is the path I must be following. That is not a problem. Intellectually I'm convinced this is the right path. My goal is to find the truth myself.\"\n\n\"But ayatih -- because of the uncontrolled self, no control over my senses. Yoga chalita manasah -- the mind wavers away from this yoga.\" Every new year we make resolutions. I said, I don't have much time left. My passion is singing, and I know I'm getting old, my voice is going.\n\nSo I said, let me practice before my voice goes away, maybe record another album. And then after a while I fall into the same pattern: \"There's not enough time. Architecture practice is more important.\" So even though I have faith and a goal, the mind wavers away from this yoga -- Yoga chalita manasah -- and attaches itself to other things. Aprapya yoga samsiddhim -- so he is not achieving.\n\n\"I have not achieved the Yoga Samsiddhim. I have not achieved the perfection in yoga. Kam gatim Krishna gacchati -- what happens to that person?\" He had all the faith, he was trying hard, but because of uncontrolled senses and mind, he wandered away from the yoga, and he dies. Time is over, time is up.\n\nKacchit na ubhaya vibhrashtah chinna abhram iva nashyati -- doesn't he get destroyed like the torn cloud, the shattered cloud? Our basic dilemma is: should I be focusing on my materialistic world and achieve accomplishments there, or should I be pursuing the path of spirituality? If I just focus on one, maybe I can get success. But doing both may not be possible.\n\nWhen we came to this town and started these classes, a couple of our businessman friends said, \"Neil, if you put as much time into business as you're putting into these Bhagavad Gita classes and Bala Vihar, you could make lots of money.\" And my friends at Chinmaya Mission said, \"Neil, if you put as much time into this spiritual work as you put into your architectural practice, you'd make so much more progress.\" When I left Houston, I had just come to the United States, and Swamiji had also come to the United States. I got inspired and started attending Gaurang Bhai's classes, completely immersed in Vedanta. Then when I got a job offer, I told Gaurang Bhai, \"I need to go to Dallas.\" He said, \"Neil, then what will happen to all this spiritual study?\" I said, \"Gaurang Bhai, I have only one desire: to design high-rise buildings. That's why I came to the United States. Once I fulfill this desire -- I'm working for a company that does nothing but high-rises -- then I'm going to focus on this spiritual path.\" He said, \"It's never going to happen.\" And it's true -- I continue to practice architecture. So should I now consider that I'm going to be lost from both sides?",
      "reflection": "Arjuna's question in these verses voices a universal anxiety: What if I try sincerely but fail? \"Ayatih shraddhayopeto yogac chalita-manasah\" - one who has faith and makes effort, yet whose mind wanders from yoga, \"aprapya yoga-samsiddhim kam gatim Krishna gacchati\" - failing to attain perfection, what becomes of him? This is not lack of faith but honest fear. Life is short, time runs out, and we know our minds are not fully under control.\n\nThe powerful metaphor of the torn cloud (chinnabhram) expresses this fear vividly: like a cloud broken apart by wind, neither giving rain nor rejoining the sky, does the unsuccessful yogi get destroyed, having gained neither worldly success nor spiritual perfection? \"Ubhaya-vibhrashta\" - fallen from both paths. This is the fundamental dilemma many face: if I pursue spirituality seriously, I may neglect my worldly duties and fail there; if I focus on the world, I make no spiritual progress. Can I afford to do both halfway?\n\nThe urgency of this question reflects real-life experience. Friends on both sides offer the same advice: \"If you put as much time into business as you do into Gita classes, you'd be wealthy\" or \"If you put as much time into practice as you do into your profession, you'd be realized.\" Neither side seems wrong. Today, sit with this genuine question without rushing to answers: What is your deepest fear about the spiritual path? That you'll waste time? That you'll fail at both worldly and spiritual life? Articulating the fear clearly is the first step toward receiving Krishna's reassuring answer in the next verses."

Don't underestimate the power of your mind. That it's Pramathini. Even any powerful thing also can be tamed.\n\nSo we Talked about the hydro power Water, when it is flooding, has a great capacity to create destruction.

In the path of seeking the truth, every seeker comes to seek doubt. First thing we hear is this chapter is great, but meditation is not easy. So Bhagavan said, okay, if you are really serious, keep trying.\n\nKeep trying and keep trying and try and try again, boys. You will succeed at last. You know, you will continue trying and you will achieve that. Now is another doubt because we know that this life is limited. Just looking at all the things which is happening. We have one of our friend died last week.\n\nBiswanath Basu went to India. He wrote back saying his father went to surgery: \"Thank you very much for prayers.\" And yesterday he sent a note saying his father passed away. So people feel they may have very little time left. \"Neil, finish all the podcasts\" -- what do we want to do? Quickly move on.

And then after a while I fall into the same pattern: \"There's not enough time. Architecture practice is more important.\" So even though I have faith and a goal, the mind wavers away from this yoga -- Yoga chalita manasah -- and attaches itself to other things. Aprapya yoga samsiddhim -- so he is not achieving.\n\n\"I have not achieved the Yoga Samsiddhim. I have not achieved the perfection in yoga. Kam gatim Krishna gacchati -- what happens to that person?\" He had all the faith, he was trying hard, but because of uncontrolled senses and mind, he wandered away from the yoga, and he dies. Time is over, time is up.\n\nKacchit na ubhaya vibhrashtah chinna abhram iva nashyati -- doesn't he get destroyed like the torn cloud, the shattered cloud? Our basic dilemma is: should I be focusing on my materialistic world and achieve accomplishments there, or should I be pursuing the path of spirituality? If I just focus on one, maybe I can get success. But doing both may not be possible.\n\nWhen we came to this town and we started these classes, a couple of our friends who made new friends, they said Neil, they are businessmen, said Neil, as much time you are putting in this Bhagavad Gita classes in Balvi and all that, if you put in business, you can make lots of money. And my friends at Chinmay Mission said Neil, as much time you're putting in your architectural practice if you put as much time in this. When I left Houston and I was completely immersed into this Vedanta, I had just come to United States, Swamiji has come to United States. And I got inspired and started going to Gaurang Bai's classes. So when I got a job and I said Gaurang bhai, I need to go to Dallas. So he said Neil, then what will happen to all this?\n\nI said Gaurang bhai, I have only one desire to design high rise building. And that's why I came to United States once I get this chance. Because I was working for a company which does nothing but high rise building. Or at least I got a job. He said, once I fulfill my desire, I'm going to focus on this. It's never going to happen.\n\nAnd it's true, I'm continue to practice architecture. So should I really now consider that I'm going to be lost from both sides?",
      "reflection": "Krishna's response in verse 40 is profoundly reassuring: \"Partha naiveha namutra vinashas tasya vidyate\" - My dear child, there is no destruction for this person, either in this world or the next. \"Na hi kalyana-krit kashchid durgatim tata gacchati\" - one who does good never comes to grief. This is a universal guarantee: sincere spiritual effort is never wasted. Even if you do not reach the goal in this lifetime, the progress you make is preserved and continued.\n\nThe mechanism is explained in verses 41-42: the yoga-bhrashta (one fallen from yoga) either takes birth in a pure and prosperous family where conditions support continued practice, or - even more rarely - in a family of wise yogis where spiritual progress can resume immediately. The second birth is described as \"durlabhataram\" - more difficult to obtain. This reveals the value of being born into a spiritually oriented family; such a birth is the result of significant previous effort.\n\nThe concept of spiritual bank balance is illuminating. If you retire and move to another country, your wealth comes with you. Similarly, the development of your inner instrument - the purification of mind and intellect, the wisdom gained, the vasanas refined - transfers to your next life. This is why child prodigies exist: mathematical geniuses and musical virtuosos are not accidents but continuations of development from previous lives. Today, take comfort in this assurance. Every moment of sincere practice, every genuine attempt to control the mind, every act of selfless service is deposited in an account that can never be lost. What investment could be more secure?"

We are also coming to the conclusion of the first segment of Bhagavad Gita. As we had discussed many times before, Bhagavad Gita is divided into three segments. First six chapters deal with who I am at this limited being as an individual. Next six chapters will deal with who that ultimate reality is. The last three chapters will deal with how you can synchronize these two.\n\nSo we are coming to the end of the first segment of Bhagavad Gita and what we have learned so far is in the chapter one we have learnt about our own situation, that our situation is not clear cut in life. Things don't come in life as clear as black and white. It comes in various shades of gray. That was the first chapter, Arjuna Vishada Yoga that confuses us. Chapter two gave us a thumbnail sketch the entire knowledge of Bhagavad Gita, Upanishada and Brahma Sutra. What is reality and what is perceived to be my reality?\n\nRight now I consider myself to be mortal. I had a beginning and I'll have an end. And the elder Bhagwan said, your self is imperishable, immutable. We have come to this stage by passing through many, many experiences in different states of existence. Chapters three through five gave us instruction on how to optimize our performance in this life using the equipment we have -- dealing with the cards we are dealt.\n\nHow do you optimize your game? That was the topic of chapter third through fifth. And chapter six gave us the instruction how to now raise your plateau. I'm comfortable dealing in this sphere. How do I now go a step above that? You may be a local level politician going through the school board elections.\n\nThen I want to do at the state level. Then I want to do at a national level. Well, how do I raise my plateau is the topic of chapter 6, Dhyana Yoga Yoga of meditation. All my focus right now is this body, this mind, this intellect and this world. Now how do I conduct transaction in this world and how do I optimize it? That's what we have learned.\n\nChapter six is, now that you have learned how to optimize your performance in this world, go to the next level of finding out what is the real nature of the self is there was meditation. We have learned in this process that there are two ways to get there. The one who gives up the fruits of actions is a Karma Yogi. The one who gives up the sense of agency -- \"I am the doer\" -- is a Sannyasi. Both reach the same goal of realizing the truth, the self. That changes my identification from this limited being to that unlimited self.\n\nSo we have elaborate discussion about how to meditate. And then we have come to the last portion of it where Arjuna had two doubts. First is we are talking about controlling our mind. My experience so far is mind is so fickle. Controlling it doesn't seem like an achievable goal. And Bhagavan said it can be done by Abhyasa in Vairagya, by constant practice, by forming a habit.\n\nOnce you form a habit, it becomes very easy, automatic. So that's Abhyasa and Vairagya. To form a habit in one sphere, you have to undo your habits in the other sphere -- that is Vairagya. You have to give up what you are attached to right now in order to do something else. Then Arjuna had the second doubt: \"I sincerely try all these things, but then I run out of time.\"\n\nThen what happens to all my efforts? Will that be all in vain? That I have lost on both hands? That I have not enjoyed my life here in the material world? And also I'm not making any progress in my spiritual evolution. In response to that, we have seen that the concept of reincarnation was reintroduced in this chapter.\n\nWhere I am today is the sum total of all my experiences before. What I'm doing with my total experiences now in my present today, that will make my future. This life is a continuum. This existence is a continuum. Whether I exist in this form or the other. When I was born, I was a baby.\n\nI existed as a baby for a while, then as a teenager, then as a young man. But I exist all through this. So will you exist in your future state of existence we call a rebirth. And there he gives us assurance. Fruits of all your efforts will be with you. You will carry your bank balance.\n\nIf I retire from my practice here and leave the United States and go to India, what will happen to all my bank balance? It will come with you. It will be transferable. You can convert it into rupees. So all that we have done will come with us in our next life. That's the assurance.\n\nSo the last few verses which you have seen say that the Yogi who had been striving to achieve this but cannot come see, falls from his path for whatever reason, runs out of time, get distracted. He said then he will get a place in his next birthday in a conducive environment. Suchinam srimatam Gehei. He will take birth in the house of a pure and wealthy. So he will have conducive environment to pursue his path. This is what he will then go and fulfill all his desires.\n\nBhagavan guarantees that all your desires will be fulfilled sooner or later. As long as you have a strong desire to achieve something, to experience something, you will achieve it sooner or later. Most of the things I wanted to do in my 20s, I finally got it in 60s. So it takes that much time. But you will be the assurance is all your desires will be fulfilled. You will have time to exhaust them.\n\nThen continue pursuing your path again. That if the Yogi had some desires left to pursue, but those who have no desire, they purely in the path of this yoga, but ran out of time. He said they will take birth in a home of a yogi where the utmost was conducive for him to start his journey right away, to continue on his path. And then the last few verses talks about what will happen once you take that next birth. Tatratam buddhi sahyogam labate Parva DEI kam. Parva dehikam in the last life, the knowledge which you have gathered through your efforts in yoga, in meditation, in a Karma yoga, whatever practice you have done.\n\nThis is also true for all our secular efforts. That's why we have talked about child prodigies, musical geniuses, mathematical geniuses. Our culture doesn't consider these an accident or random happening. It's a systematic evolution of that intellect to come to that point. They say he gets Buddhi Samyogam -- he gets associated with the buddhi he developed in his last birth. Yatate cha tatah bhuyah samsiddhau Kuru Nandana -- and then he strives even more than before, because now he gets even more encouraged by his own accomplishments, his own prowess.\n\nThe child who is good at mathematics will be more encouraged to learn more and more quickly because he gets encouraged by his own success. Nothing succeeds like success and nothing fails like failure. Once you get this taste of success, you go more and more -- so there, Yatate, striving even more than before. He will achieve that perfection. Kuru Nandana -- so he addresses Arjuna as Kuru Nandana.\n\nYou are the son of the Kuru dynasty. Remind them how did you come to this jackpot that you were born in a Kuru dynasty as a prince because of your past karmas. You and I constantly question why I have this situation, and the others have better situation than I. But we never question why I have better situation than those who do not. We have come to this situation by our own efforts. Hinduism doesn't give any other choice but to put all the responsibilities on you.\n\nYou are the architect of your own destiny, even your parents. You have chosen yourself as per our scriptures. Which house will I buy when I move out from my current house? Whatever the bank balance I have created and what the neighbor, I think will be the best. That's where I'm going to go and buy a house, right? There may be hundreds of other nice neighbors.\n\nI never knew about it or never thought they would be conducive for me. I go to some of these farmhouses and really wonder why people want to live here. One it looks so scary for miles. You know, there's nobody if something happens at night to take a grocery or drive probably another 20 miles to buy a grocery. But they say, no, no, we live in farmhouse because that's what that person thought is the right way to live for me. Put me in the densest neighborhood and I'll be very, very happy.\n\nSo each one of us decides what is best for us. And that is what Bhagavan gives. Bhagavan is so compassionate. So there he says, in your new situation you will be associated with your intellect, which you are gathered in the Pavadaya in your past existence. And there you will try even more to achieve the perfection, reminding Arjuna and all of us, how did we come to this stage because of our past effort, why we are in Gita group and not in some other place. Because your own efforts you gathered this interest to learn Bhagavad Gita.\n\nThe next verse says: Purva abhyasena tena eva hriyate hi avashah api sah, jijnasuh api yogasya shabda brahma ativartate. By that very former practice he is born with -- in spite of himself, in spite of whatever the circumstances are -- because of purva abhyasa, by your previous experiences and studies, you will make progress. When Mohandas Gandhi left India to go to London for his studies, what did his mother say? \"You will not eat meat. You will not do this.\"\n\nThat was the fear: when you leave your country, you will be influenced by the other culture and forget your own culture, your own values, your own traditions. But look what's happening here. We have more Gita classes and Bala Vihar classes in this country than when I was growing up in India. There were no Gita classes then. Because of your own vasanas, you continue wherever you go. Swamiji gives this example: somebody's parents came and he was very worried.\n\nHow will I keep my father engaged after all? I found out that his father himself found a company in the neighborhood because he was great at Tinpathi. He somehow, whether he speaks English or not, he found people in the neighborhood who plays Tinpathi and he made his friends by himself. With your own vasanas, you will find your own environment to fit in. In spite of whatever environment you are in, you will strive harder, and jijnasuh api -- with curiosity about yoga -- asking \"What is that perfection which I need to achieve?\" Yogasya shabda brahma ativartate -- with that yoga, he will go beyond Shabda Brahma. Now, these final few verses are actually the preface to the next chapter, where you will be introduced to the concept of Shabda Brahma. We all have learned that in our culture the sound symbol of God is Om.",
      "reflection": "Verse 43 describes what happens after a spiritually inclined person takes a new birth: \"Tatra tam buddhi-samyogam labhate paurva-dehikam\" - there, that person regains connection with the intelligence developed in the previous body. This explains the phenomenon we see: some people are inexplicably drawn to spiritual seeking from early childhood, while others with every advantage show no such inclination. The draw comes from within - from previous development - not from external circumstances alone.\n\nThe remarkable statement in verse 44 - \"Purvaabhyasena tenaiva hriyate hy avasho'pi sah\" - emphasizes that one is carried forward by previous practice, even against one's conscious will. Parents feared their son would lose his culture in a foreign land, but instead, more Gita classes flourish in America than in India. A father visiting from abroad, speaking little English, spontaneously finds friends who play Tinpathi because that is his vasana seeking expression. Your deeper tendencies will find their outlet regardless of external circumstances.\n\nVerse 45 gives the long view: \"Aneka-janma-samsiddhas tato yati param gatim\" - perfected through many births, one finally reaches the supreme goal. This is not discouraging but realistic. We would not expect to master any great skill in a single attempt; why expect instant enlightenment? Today, reflect on your own spiritual tendencies. What aspects of the practice feel natural, as if you are remembering rather than learning? What draws you to these teachings? Trust that these inclinations are not random but reflect your soul's ongoing journey. Continue practicing with faith that nothing is lost and everything contributes to eventual attainment."

      "reflection": "As Chapter 6 concludes, Krishna offers a clear hierarchy in verse 46: the yogi is greater than the ascetic (tapasvi), greater than the scholar (jnani), and greater than the ritualist (karmi). This is not to demean any path, but to clarify that integrated spiritual practice - yoga in its full sense - surpasses partial approaches. One can torture the body without purifying the mind; one can accumulate knowledge without transforming behavior; one can perform elaborate rituals without developing inner awareness. The yogi combines right understanding with sustained practice and integration into daily life.\n\nThe final verse offers the ultimate teaching: \"Yoginam api sarvesham mad-gatenantaratmana, shraddhaavan bhajate yo mam sa me yuktatamo matah\" - of all yogis, the one who worships Me with faith, with the inner self absorbed in Me, is the most united with Me. This devotional culmination may seem surprising after detailed meditation instructions, but it reveals that the highest yoga is not merely technique but relationship. The peak of practice is not achieving a state but becoming intimate with the Divine.\n\nThese verses conclude the first section of the Bhagavad Gita - the six chapters exploring \"who am I?\" You have learned about your confusion (Chapter 1), your true nature (Chapter 2), the path of selfless action (Chapter 3), the means of purification (Chapter 4), the yoga of renunciation (Chapter 5), and now the yoga of meditation (Chapter 6). The next six chapters will explore \"who is That?\" - the nature of the Divine reality. But before moving on, let the teaching of these final verses sink in: become a yogi, and among yogis, become one whose heart is absorbed in the Supreme. What single practice can you commit to that integrates all you have learned in these first six chapters?"

      "commentary": "Unlike a car with its user's manual, we are born without instructions on how to live. We experience life's vicissitudes without a so-called user's manual. The Gita has been described as such a guide. We have seen that the first six chapters described Jivatma, the conditioned self. The science which we are interested in is that of the self. What is the nature of my being?\n\nThat's the quest in learning Bhagavad Gita. The self -- in Sanskrit, Atma -- is what I'm trying to figure out. The first six chapters taught me what the conditioned self is called: Jivatma, what you and I call \"myself.\"\n\nThis is me, this myself, this is yourself. That self is conditioned by my perception of who I am. The \"I\" that refers to my body, my mind, my intellect, and all the things I have achieved -- that's Jivatma in Vedanta. It is nothing but a conditioned self.\n\nConditioned by this body, mind, and intellect. Just as room space is space, just like the space outside -- but I call it \"room space\" because it's conditioned by the room. The room is made up of four walls, a floor, and a ceiling. If you take one of those away, it's no longer a room, but the space itself remains. Space was always here.\n\nI created the conditioning. Now I call it room space. Similarly, I created the conditioning called \"me\" -- this body, this mind, this intellect -- and they called it Jiva Atma. Every conditioned being is a Jivatma. Who that is, we have discussed in detail in the first six chapters: who I am, how I act in this world, what the consequences of my actions are, and how I can avoid sorrow and unhappiness.\n\nKarma Yoga culminated in meditation -- what some may call Raja Yoga. We started with Karma Yoga, then graduated to Dhyana Yoga, the yoga of meditation. Now we need to know: where do I go from here? I understood what Jivatma is. I need to now understand who Paramatma is.\n\nSupreme self, space, room space, universal space -- I understood what the room space is, but my mind right now can't grasp what the universal space is. So I now need to graduate from room space to understanding the universal space. For that, I first start with understanding the conditioned self, the Jivatma, and then move toward the Paramatma, the supreme self. The next six chapters will tell us about Ishvara, the Lord Almighty, who is the creator of this universe and who is in control of all the Jivatmas.\n\nAll Jivatmas are functioning because of Ishwara, just as all room spaces in all the rooms in the world exist because of universal space. But right now I only understand the conditioned self. From Jivatma, I'm migrating to Paramatma. I may not understand Him in His essence, so I now need to come down to one level below -- to Him as the creator.\n\nHim as the controller of all the beings -- that is whom we call Ishvara. My friends who know me may not know me as an architect, but my clients know me as one. They can only understand me through the relationship they have with me. I am the creation of the Creator. If I can understand my relationship with Him -- the creation and the Creator -- that's easier than finding out who He is in all His entirety.\n\nSo we'll start with Ishvara, the one who created this universe as I can perceive, feel, and touch it -- which is called Prakriti in Sanskrit. The one who is in control of the Prakriti is Purusha. The next six chapters will explore that. And it has to culminate into devotion for that Paramatma. For me to know someone in his or her entirety, I need to identify with him or her.\n\nThat identification becomes love. For me to know Paramatma, I need to devote myself to Paramatma. I need to start identifying with that Paramatma. That identification will become devotion. So these six chapters will culminate into 12th chapter Bhakti Yoga, the yoga of devotion. We started with Karma Yoga.\n\nWe graduated to Raja Yoga. We're now marching towards Bhakti Yoga, the yoga of devotion. So these first three verses -- Bhagavan, in the last verse of the previous chapter, set up the stage and said: the one who wants to know yoga, even out of just curiosity -- \"I really want to know what yoga is all about\" -- he's better than the Karma Kandi, the one who is simply doing rituals.\n\nI'm a very religious person. I need to have my business run properly by Bhagavan's grace. Early morning, before I go to my job, I need to do the puja as quickly as I can. Before 8 o'clock, I do puja and run. I'm done with Bhagavan today.\n\nThen I say, well, now things are getting even more hectic. I actually asked somebody in India, and I said, \"What about puja?\" He said, \"I just go online and I have this website. You click on Ganpati Puja, the Ganpati Murti comes in, there is agarbatti on the side. You click on the agarbatti, it lights up. You click on the lamp, the lamp lights up. You click on the garland, garland comes on. You click on the aarti -- I can do it anywhere now. It's very, very easy.\"\n\nSo we say that's Karmakanda -- just performing rituals mechanically. \"I decided that I have to do this to be on the good side of the Lord\" -- that is a Karma Kandi. Bhagavan said, even one who merely wants to know yoga is better than a Karma Kandi. I may not have any interest in performing yoga, but if I want to know what yoga is, I'm at least better than that.\n\nThen obviously, the yogi is said to be better than a Gnani, a Tapasvi, or even a Sanyasi. Because the yogi is the one who has given up everything in terms of the fruits of actions and is relying on the Lord to give him the Karma Phala. \"I'll do my duty as His vehicle. I'm just a Nimitta Matra.\" My actions are there because I'm empowered by the Lord to do this. I can speak because I'm alive.\n\nI'm alive because the consciousness is still functioning through this body. That consciousness belongs to the Supreme Consciousness. You and I are conscious of each other because the same consciousness functioning through me is functioning through you. If you had two incompatible programs, we wouldn't be talking to each other. Two computers don't talk to each other if one is on Windows and the other on a different system.\n\nBut we can, because the same consciousness is functioning through you and me. So Bhagawan said, the one who has given up his sense of \"I am in control\" and surrendered -- he's a yogi, and he's better than all of that. Now Bhagavan says Arjuna is all charged up and wants to know. The seventh chapter continues as Gnana Vignana Yoga, the Yoga of Knowledge and Wisdom. So what is the difference?\n\nWe obviously had a discussion last time. Something which I know is Gnana. Something which I do not know is obviously ignorance. Then Vignana -- Visheshta Gnana -- is special knowledge.\n\nNormal knowledge is: I know you people are in the room. That's knowledge because I can see it and vouch for it. The knowledge which I can perceive, feel, and touch through my senses is Gnana. But when we process that knowledge and come to another conclusion, that is Vignana. So the Swami Chidananda Bhagavad Gita which I have here --\n\nIt basically says Gnana requires sight -- in other words, the senses. Vignana is insight. Gnana requires tuition: for me to learn Bhagavad Gita, I had to go to Swami Chinmayananda.\n\nSight requires tuition. But the knowledge of what I learned requires intuition. Music is the one which I really understand well because I have a lot of difficulty learning that. I went to my teacher to learn that and he will say, Neel, do this sargam. You know, Subha says, it's too difficult. I know how to sing song.\n\nI said, no, no, you need to do this sargam. And while I was doing it, it was so difficult. And then he told me that one day it will come naturally to you and you yourself will understand how to do it. And I didn't believe him. But it did happen exactly that way. Things which I couldn't learn while he was teaching me, but I know what to do came naturally to me.\n\nAt one point, when I was trying to practice it, I didn't need to make any effort to figure out what it is -- because it became my own knowledge. Intuitively, I knew what it was. I asked my nephew, who has been a prodigy since he was about six years old -- he can do any music he wants. I asked him, \"Advaita, teach me how to do this.\"\n\nHe said, uncle, I don't know how to teach you. I myself do not know how I'm doing it. I just know how to do it. So the vignana is the intuitive knowledge. Once you gather the knowledge and absorbed it as your own, intuitively you use it for its right application is vignana. So Bhagavan says, sometimes it's translated as wisdom.\n\nWisdom is not something you sit down and decide to do. Wisdom is when somebody says something and you know what to do with it. It's an intuitive knowledge born out of the knowledge and experiences you have accumulated. And that wisdom you cannot claim as your own, because something in you has the ability to grasp that knowledge. When you're alive, you can do it. When you're dead, you can't be conscious of it.\n\nYour consciousness is that entity which is the source of intuition. So Bhagavan said, \"I will tell you now.\" Yogam yunjan, mad ashrayha, asansayam samagram mam, yatha jnasyasi tat shrunu. This is a promise to all beings who really want to know who they are. He said, \"Now listen carefully, O Partha, because I'll tell you what the knowledge and the wisdom is.\" But here are the prerequisites.\n\nWith your mind clinging to me, taking refuge in me, and practicing Yoga, you will without any doubt know me in full. Three things. Bhagavan said, \"I'm going to tell you what you need to know, but your mind should be focused on me.\" If I want to learn something, I obviously need to be focused on that.\n\nI want to find out how my BlackBerry works -- I need to be focused on it. I still can't use all the features on my BlackBerry because I'm not focused enough.",
      "reflection": "Krishna opens this chapter with three prerequisites for knowing the Divine: a mind clinging to the Supreme (mayyasaktamanah), taking refuge in Him (madasrayah), and practicing yoga (yogam yunjan). Today, examine which of these three areas needs your attention most. Is your mind scattered across countless worldly concerns, rarely resting on the deeper questions of existence? Do you truly take refuge in a higher purpose, or do you rely solely on your own limited efforts? How consistent is your actual practice of meditation and self-inquiry?\n\nConsider Krishna's sobering statement that among thousands of people, scarcely one strives for perfection, and even among those who strive, few truly know Him in essence. This is not meant to discourage but to inspire urgency. Ask yourself: Am I among those rare seekers who genuinely pursue self-knowledge, or am I content with surface-level spirituality? The distinction between Jnana (knowledge gained through study) and Vijnana (wisdom through direct realization) is crucial here. Today, take one teaching you intellectually understand and consciously apply it in a difficult situation. Notice the gap between knowing and being.\n\nWhat would it mean to move from tuition to intuition in your spiritual life? Just as a musician eventually plays without conscious effort, how might you internalize these teachings so deeply that right understanding becomes spontaneous?"

      "commentary": "Chapter 7, Gnana Vignana Yoga -- the Yoga of Knowledge and its Application, or Realization, or Wisdom. Whichever way we define the word Vignana: Vishishta Gnana, special knowledge. Knowledge becomes special when we apply it, so the application of knowledge is Vignana. At the end of the last chapter, Bhagawan gave a hint about what we'll be discussing here. He said that among the yogis, the one whose inner self merges with me and who worships me with faith is the greatest Yogi. First of all, in the last six chapters, Bhagawan told Arjuna to become a Yogi -- Sarva Sankalpa Sanyasi, Yoga Rudha Uchyati.\n\nOne who is completely devoid of all Sankalpa -- all fancies of the mind about what can give me happiness and where my happiness lies -- such a person is a yogi. So the advice from Bhagavan to Arjuna and all of us was: become a Yogi so that you can remove this parallax between \"Tat\" and \"Tvam.\" In our understanding of \"myself,\" I am this limited being -- this consciousness confined in this body, mind, and intellect is me. But Bhagavan says your consciousness is no different than the supreme Consciousness, which is all pervading. That parallax I have to remove. I see these two selves -- myself and the supreme Self. How do I remove this parallax and make them one? That is the goal.\n\nSo Bhagwan said to meditate on the supreme self. Right now we are meditating on the limited self. We are constantly in the state of Samadhi identifying with this limited being, and therefore I am in love with it. Everything I do, everything I accomplish, I am very proud of it. So Bhagawan said, that's because you are in constant Samadhi with this limited self. You now have to contemplate on your supreme self, which is God, Brahman, the Ishvara, whatever the name we give him.\n\nThe problem is we really have no idea about what that self is all about. We've heard about it; we have been given indications by Bhagavan in the second chapter. But how can I devote myself to it? To devote myself, I have to have devotion. Devotion is nothing but love for the Divine. And love is nothing but identification.\n\nIdentification only comes when I have complete understanding or knowledge about that thing or being. The more I know about that thing or being, the more I identify with it or him or her, and the more I love that person or thing or being. So to love the Divine, to devote myself to the Divine, I need to know the nature of that Divine. Bhagawan has devoted the entire Chapter 7 to this. For those who have reached that state of desire, Mumukshatvam -- I need to be one with that -- Bhagawan has given in the first three verses an introduction. These are the three qualities you are going to require to achieve this: Mind should be in love with me. Asakta -- who has the attachment, so mind should be attached to him.\n\nThe supreme -- here Bhagwan means the Supreme. Yogam yunjan -- who has become a Yogi, as has been described in the previous chapters. Sarvasankalpa Sanyasi. And Mat Ashrayaha -- who is taking refuge only in me, who knows that his liberation, his ultimate happiness lies in identifying with that Brahman only. There is no other source of long-lasting, everlasting happiness. All other things can give me temporary joy but not long-lasting happiness. Asansayam, without doubt I will tell you how you can achieve that. Bhagawan had given this indication, and the very first indication he gives us is where to find him in this world. We never see Bhagavan, never come across him in my transactions anywhere.\n\nWhere is he and what is he? This is the first verse each seeker can relate to and contemplate. Bhagawan said, you see me every day. Everything that you see, hear, touch, smell through your senses is nothing but me. Everything in this world is made up of these five great elements. But these five great elements do not create any experience unless there is a knower.\n\nSo to create the sense objects out of these five great elements, you need a Knower. And the knower is Manas, Buddhi, Ahankar. These five great elements create the sense objects, which are the knowables. The three -- Manas, Buddhi, Ahankar -- create the Knower, that which will know the sense objects. So corresponding to these five great elements, we have the five sense objects: Shabda, Sparsha, Rupa, Rasa, Gandha. But they all reside in my mind.\n\nWe know from physics that particles and atoms do not have color, shape, or smell on their own. But we see colors and smell fragrances. So this mind is the knower -- it creates the sense objects to enjoy. Iti me bhinna prakriti ashtadha. This world of knowables and knower, and the experiences and exchanges between them, creates this lower Prakriti, the Eightfold Prakriti of mine. So know that anything which you see, anything which you touch, anything which you hear, is nothing but me alone -- my manifestation only.\n\nThis is the very first exercise. One can do that every time he sees, he should remember that it is nothing but his manifestation and nothing. There is no other thing. And then he says, apara ayam ITI to anyam prakruti vidhi me param. So we may come to the conclusion. If I put all the things in this world together, then that's Bhagavan Bhagawan.\n\nIt is like if I have all the parts of Tesla in boxes or I can put a Tesla together. You need something else to make Tesla what Tesla is. So it says, apara ayam itutu annyam prakrutim vidhi me param. This is my lower Prakriti. Lower Prakrutin is the grosser manifestation. It is something which can be perceived by senses.\n\nThese five elements which we have described, I can perceive through my senses. Now the scientists may say, \"Oh no, Neil, they were not knowledgeable enough. There are more than 100 elements.\" But these elements are related to sense perception. Space is the subtlest because we can only hear through space -- there is no other perception of space.\n\nBut Bhoomi is the grossest because it can have all five perceptions: Sabdha, Sparsa, Rupa, Rasa, Gandha. Bhumi has all five of them. Space is only one, Sabdha, and so on and so forth. So the more sense perception, the grosser the element is. Bhagwan said, this is my lower Prakriti which can be known through your senses.\n\nJivabhuta Mahabhaho yaya idam dharyate jagat. But by which this world is upheld -- this entire universe is sustained by that element -- that is my higher Prakriti. Viddhi me param: know that there is a higher Prakriti of mine which is sustaining both the knower and the knowable. The knower -- the mind, Buddhi, intellect -- and the sense objects are only possible if there is life in that knower, a living force.\n\nThat living force is something completely different than mind, completely different than intellect and the world of perception. Etad yonini bhutani sarvani iti upadharaya. This is the womb of all beings. These two prakritis -- the lower which is perceptible through my eyes and ears, and now we have additional means to perceive this world, like the telescope and the microscope.\n\nSo we have expanded our senses by adding those instruments. But no matter how far we can go, we will never be able to perceive anything without consciousness itself. Even a scientist who knows all about electrons and quarks -- the fundamental building blocks, at least as we know them -- can only know if he is conscious. Etad yonini bhutani sarvani iti upadharaya. These two prakritis together are the womb of all beings: the lower Prakriti, which is manifest and can be perceived through the senses and understood by the intellect; and the para, which is unmanifest. I do not know what the life force is all about. I do not know what consciousness is.\n\nI know I am conscious. I am aware that I exist, but I cannot define it. No science has yet successfully defined consciousness. Being unmanifest, it cannot be described. This indescribable consciousness and the world of matter together constitute the womb of all things and beings, no matter what they are. Aham krtsnasya jagatah prabhavah pralayastatha. Now Bhagavan says, \"I am actually slightly different than these two.\"\n\nI'm not just the lower Prakriti. I'm not just the higher Prakriti, the womb of all beings. I am the source of both. I am the source of both the Prakritis -- the para and apara. Aham krtsnasya jagatah prabhavah pralayah. All knowables and knowers come out of me. They also merge in me.\n\nIt is something like the entire world of my dream coming out of my own mind, and also dissolving into my own mind. When I wake up, the dream world is gone. None of the knowers or knowables in my dream remain, because the mind is something higher than both. Bhagawan says, \"I am the Brahman which projects itself as the Ishvara through Maya, which creates Prakriti and also creates the mind, Buddhi, and Ahankar.\" Know that I'm higher than both the para and apara Prakriti, and I am the substratum for the creation and dissolution of this universe.\n\nIn our science we know everything about Big Bang. And up to the few seconds after the Big Bang, we just do not know what was the singularity and what was before the Big Bang. That we probably will never know, at least in our lifetime. The Bhagavan said, you can know everything about your Buddhi. But beyond Buddhi it is very difficult to know. Matthaha parataram na anyat kinchi dasti dhananjaya.\n\nThat which is the source of both this world of my experiences and the experiencer -- there is nothing more than that. That which has created this life in me, that which I feel as myself -- there is nothing beyond that. In other words, there is nothing subtler than that. The grosser the element, the easier I can perceive it. The subtler it is, the more difficult it is for me. Then it comes to a point where it is imperceptible.\n\nThere is nothing subtler than that self, life itself, consciousness itself. This is obviously a very famous verse, a milestone verse: this consciousness, this entity which cannot be described, cannot be perceived, cannot be thought of, is the source of all things and beings. All things and beings are strung into it -- in other words, supported as this universe. This universe has laws, functions, and activity depending on Rajas, Tamas, and Sattva. But all that is only possible because of that entity called consciousness.\n\nSo the metaphor is about a pearl necklace, where I can see the pearls. The pearls are held in a particular formation.\n\nAnd I know that there is something holding the pearls in that particular formation, but I do not see what it is. I know that if you take that element out, the pearls will fall apart and scatter all over the floor. Everything is in this formation, which we call the universe, because of that underlying principle which is holding it all together. Bhagavan is continuously giving indications about what you should think about when you work in this world.\n\nRight now, my world is divided into I and the world, the two entities. But one is trying to bring them closer, to make that difference. What you are made up of, what the world is made up of, is one and the same thing. My body and my chair are made of the same material called the electron and quarks.",
      "reflection": "Krishna reveals His Eightfold Prakriti: earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intellect, and ego. This is His lower nature (apara prakriti), while the life force that sustains everything is His higher nature (para prakriti). Today, as you move through the world, practice recognizing both. When you drink water, acknowledge it as Divine manifestation. When a thought arises in your mind, recognize even that mental activity as part of the Lord's Prakriti. The challenge is to see that not only the beautiful sunset but also your own ego, your intellect, your very sense of \"I am this body\" are all expressions of the same Divine energy.\n\nReflect on the profound statement: \"I am the source and dissolution of the entire universe.\" Everything emerges from this one reality and returns to it. Like the analogy of a Tesla car, having all the parts does not make a working vehicle; something more is needed to bring it all together. What is that animating principle in your own life? Today, notice moments when you feel most alive, most conscious. That very awareness, that sense of being present, is a glimpse of the higher Prakriti.\n\nConsider: If the same consciousness that functions through you also functions through everyone you meet today, how might that change the way you interact with the difficult coworker, the impatient driver, or the stranger on the street?"

      ],
      "commentary": "We have been discussing Chapter 7, Gnana Vignana Yoga, the Yoga of Knowledge and Wisdom. In the beginning, Bhagavan said, \"I'm going to tell you who I am, and I'll tell you all about it without leaving anything behind.\" And then he basically said that what you see in this world is my Eightfold Prakriti.\n\nWe all claim that we have never seen Bhagavan before. We have never seen God. We have never known Him. Bhagawan says, \"You know me every day, you meet me every day. You just don't recognize it.\" Because what you see is the Bhoomi, Apaha, Analaha, Kham, Vayuhu -- the five elements which make up the entire world of ours. It is nothing but my own manifestation.\n\nThen he also included Manas, Buddhi, Ahankara. When we think about the five elements, we only think about the insentient world, the world of matter. We say, \"Well, we are human beings, we are living beings.\" But no -- even my mind, my intellect, my ego. Bhagavan said, that's my Prakriti.\n\nThat's my own nature, you know, it's my own manifestation. So when you include all of that, that includes all the beings and things, there's nothing left behind. He said, that's nothing but me manifesting in my Eightfold Prakriti. You know me -- you just are not capable of grasping the totality of His expression. With that, he progressed and said, \"Well then, let me explain to you that all these beings have come out of me. I am the source of all beings and I am the resting place for all beings.\"\n\nThere is nothing other than Him in this world, but in His manifestation as the Eightfold Prakriti, I don't see Him in His totality. So he proceeds further in verse seven to say how everything is connected. Right now we don't feel connected to anything. No matter how hard we try, we feel like I am an island in this universe.\n\nBy myself, I am so unique. Everything else is the world. All beings are part of the world. That's what we call Jagat. We complain in Hindi all the time, you know, Jagat. Because we consider ourselves to be so unique, we are not part of this Jagat.\n\nWe are not part of this world. Even though our intellect says I am part of this world, our heart doesn't agree. We feel outside of it. We are in the center of our own universe. When I see the world this way, I don't see connection.\n\nHow am I connected to the rest of the world? Verse 7 says: Mattah parataram na anyat kinchit asti dhananjaya. There is nothing that exists other than me. So how can you exist without me? From that one singularity, the whole plurality came out. Everything in the plurality is part of that.\n\nIf I am part of this world, I am part of that singularity. Therefore there is nothing other than me exist. You are no other than my own self. He said, \"I am the common thread.\" The expression in English is \"that's the common thread\" -- the common thread in all these things and beings which keeps them together as the world.\n\nThe Self is the common thread. Even though right now I think \"myself\" is completely different than \"yourself\" and \"herself\" and \"himself\" -- that self remains constant in all beings. I am that common thread which keeps this universe together. The analogy, obviously, is sutre manigana iva -- in the pearl necklace, beads are all separate from each other.\n\nBut the thread keeps them together as a necklace. So I am that common thread. What is common in me and you? You also call it \"myself\" when you express yourself. That self, Bhagavan said, is the common thread among all beings. And then, obviously, for people like us who can't really understand without elaborate examples --\n\nWe can only relate to something when somebody gives an example about something we know. This may still remain abstract, but then he says, \"Okay, let me explain to you how it works.\" So the next verse says: Raso aham apsu kaunteya prabhasmi shashisuryayoh pranavah sarva vedeshu shabdah khe purusham nrshu. In other words, \"Now let me enumerate things you can understand.\" I am the liquidity in water. I am the radiance in moon and sun.\n\nWhatever we think is the unique quality of that thing or being -- he said, that's because of me. Because I reside in that being or thing, it makes the thing what it is. What is dharma in Sanskrit? That which holds is dharma. As I always use the example: the dharma of sugar is sweetness. As long as it is sweet, it is sugar. It may look like sugar, it may feel like sugar, but if it doesn't taste like sugar, it's not sugar.\n\nSo the dharma of a thing or being -- what makes it what it is -- Bhagavan says that dharma is me. Because of that dharma, things and beings are what they are. Then he continues in the next verses: Punyo gandhah prithivyam cha tejash chasmi vibhavasau jivanam sarvabhuteshu tapash chasmi tapasvisu. \"I am the sweet fragrance of this earth. I'm the radiance in fire, and I'm the life in all beings.\"\n\nVery clearly he says, \"I am the life in all beings.\" Tapash chasmi tapasvisu. In other words, anything which makes anybody what it is, is me. Living beings are living because of my presence in them. It's a profound statement which we all basically know. We have accepted: Bijam mam sarvabhutanam viddhi partha sanatanam.\n\nKnow that I am the source of all beings. I am the seed of all beings. The beings cannot exist without me. Buddhir buddhimatam asmi. I am the intellect in the intellectual, the brilliance in the brilliant.\n\nSo if I think that I am so smart, my ego says, \"It's because of my intellect.\" Bhagavan says, \"Mr. Ego, you have really nothing to do with it. I am the intellect in the intellectual, and I am the brilliance in the brilliant.\" And obviously, Balam Balavatam asmi Kama Raga Vivarjitam. Here is a very interesting point he makes: I am the strength in the strong.\n\nI am the power in the powerful. But Kama Raga Vivarjitam -- that strength is devoid of desire or attachment. It is strength without any association with desire. We only desire strength if we can use it. Isn't there an expression: \"What is the use of power if I can't abuse it?\" So this is power without any desire to abuse it.\n\nThat's what we would call sattvic strength. So Bhagavan said, \"I am the strength in the strong. But when the strong misuse that strength and hurt others, that's not me.\" So this is like, you know, He very conveniently keeps out of all the trouble we get into. \"Hey Bhagavan, if you're giving this guy all this mighty power, he'll want to hurt us!\" Bhagavan says, \"I am the strength in him.\"\n\nBut I am not the one who is hurting you. Dharma Aviruddha, Bhuteshu Kamo Asmi Bharatarshapa. Now I say, okay, what happens to all these desires we have? He said, that's also me. But that is Dharma Aviruddha. We have always this argument.\n\nIs the desire good or bad? You know, Vedantic discussion. We say, yeah, but that's also our desire. I said, well, I want to do good thing. Well, that's also desire. Well, I want to meet Bhagavan.\n\nSo if you see in our tradition, when Brahmacharis go to the guru, they first shave all their hair off. That basically indicates getting rid of all desires. You're a student now, you're a seeker. You shouldn't have any other desire. But they leave a Choti -- that indicates the Shastra Vasana, the desire for knowledge.\n\nThat Choti keeps him tied to the Sastra. Then when he becomes a Sanyasi, when that Choti is gone, when you reach a level, even attachment to the Sastra should be dropped. Because otherwise I just remain a pure Pandit. That's an attachment. It's a golden chain, Bhagawan. So even that has to be dropped.\n\nSo when he becomes a Sanyasi -- Sanyasi literally means one who has renounced -- he has renounced everything, all attachment. The Choti goes away. Even Shastra Vasana is not there. That too becomes bondage, so even that needs to go.\n\nSo where do these desires stand? Bhagwan said, \"Desires are nothing but me. I am expressing through you as your desire.\" But that is Dharma Aviruddha -- not contrary to your Dharma. When you have a desire in accordance with your Dharma, that is legitimate. I am a doctor and I have a desire to help people, perform surgery, or practice my art of medicine. That's a Dharma-aligned desire.\n\nThat's not a desire which is wrong. Bhagavan said, \"I am the desire in you which is in line with your Dharma.\" If I'm a father and I want to take care of my children, that's in line with my Dharma. If I'm a teacher and I want to make sure my students learn, that's a desire in line with my Dharma. If I am a postman and I want to deliver mail, that's in line with my Dharma. Where we get confused in our understanding of Vedanta is this: Vedanta doesn't say desire is something outside of this world.\n\nWe don't import it from somewhere. It's part of your nature, part of Bhagavan's nature. But it has to align with your Dharma, without any contradiction. I'm a treasurer in a bank, but I want to become the owner of the bank by dealing under the table? That's obviously contrary to my position. So Bhagawan says, \"I am the strength in the strong, but without any attachment or desire to use this strength in a manner contrary to Dharma.\"\n\nTherefore, Bhagavan Bhagavad Gita asks Arjuna to fight. Well, is it right or wrong? Bhagavad says, it is in line with your Dharma. You are the general of this army. All these people are relying on you. You have to use your strength to fight your battle.\n\nSo the very important point is: desires are natural as long as they are in line with your duties. I want to take care of my children -- that's in line with my Dharma. Ye chaiva Sattvika Bhava Rajasas Tamasash cha ye. Whatever beings are Sattvic, Rajasic, or Tamasic -- we classify people and things into these categories by their own nature. We know, or at least we have learned from the Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita, that this world is made up of these three Gunas: Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas.\n\nEverything else we see is the permutation and combination of these three gunas. When I have four-color printing, I may have hundreds of colors on my picture, but they are nothing but the permutation and combination of the four colors. Therefore my printer will say \"yellow is out,\" and I replace the yellow.",
      "reflection": "\"There is nothing higher than Me; all is strung upon Me as rows of pearls upon a thread.\" This image of the pearl necklace offers a powerful contemplation for today. We see individual beads and think they are separate, but an invisible thread holds them together as one necklace. What is the common thread connecting you to your family, your colleagues, even strangers you pass on the street? Krishna says it is the Self, the \"I am\" that each being experiences. Today, when someone speaks to you, try to sense that same thread of consciousness animating both of you.\n\nKrishna then gives specific examples: \"I am the fluidity in water, the light in sun and moon, the sacred syllable Om, the sound in ether, the virility in man, the fragrance of earth, the brilliance in fire, the life in all beings.\" These verses teach us to see the Divine not in abstract theology but in immediate experience. What makes water, water? Its wetness, its fluidity. What makes fire, fire? Its heat and brilliance. That essential quality, that dharma, which makes each thing what it is, is the Divine presence.\n\nToday, practice this recognition exercise: For each element you encounter, ask \"What is its essential quality?\" and recognize that quality as a direct expression of the Divine. The sweetness in your morning fruit, the warmth of sunlight on your skin, the stability of the ground beneath your feet. Can you move through an entire day holding this awareness?"

      "commentary": "We have been discussing Chapter 7, Gnana Vignana Yoga, the Yoga of Knowledge and Wisdom. In the beginning, Bhagavan said, \"I'm going to tell you who I am, and I'll tell you all about it without leaving anything behind.\" And then he said that what you see in this world is my Eightfold Prakriti.\n\nWe all claim that we have never seen Bhagavan before. We have never seen God. We have never known Him. Bhagawan says, \"You know me every day, you meet me every day. You just don't recognize it.\" Because what you see is the Bhoomi, Apaha, Analaha, Kham, Vayuhu -- the five elements which make up the entire world of ours. It is nothing but my own manifestation.\n\nThen he also included Manas, Buddhi, Ahankara. When we think about the five elements, we only think about the insentient world, the world of matter. We say, \"Well, we are human beings, we are living beings.\" But no -- even my mind, my intellect, my ego. Bhagavan said, that's my Prakriti.\n\nThat's my own nature, you know, it's my own manifestation. So when you include all of that, that includes all the beings and things, there's nothing left behind. He said, that's nothing but me manifesting in my Eightfold Prakriti. You know me -- you just are not capable of grasping the totality of His expression. With that, he progressed and said, \"Well then, let me explain to you that all these beings have come out of me. I am the source of all beings and I am the resting place for all beings.\"\n\nThere is nothing other than Him in this world, but in His manifestation as the Eightfold Prakriti, I don't see Him in His totality. So he proceeds further in verse seven to say how everything is connected. Right now we don't feel connected to anything. No matter how hard we try, we feel like I am an island in this universe.\n\nBy myself, I am so unique. Everything else is the world. All beings are part of the world. That's what says Jagat. We complain in Hindi all the time, you know, Jagat T Vesahe. You know, because we consider ourselves to be so unique, we are not part of this, Jagat.\n\nWe are not part of this world. Even though our intellect says I am part of this world. But our heart doesn't say we are part of this world. We are outside of it. We are in the center of my universe. So this, when I see, I say I don't see connection.\n\nHow am I connected to the rest of the world? Verse 7 says: Mattah parataram na anyat kinchit asti dhananjaya. There is nothing that exists other than me. So how can you exist without me? From that one singularity, the whole plurality came out. Everything in the plurality is part of that.\n\nIf I am part of this world, I am part of that singularity. Therefore there is nothing other than me exist. You are no other than my own self. He said, \"I am the common thread.\" The expression in English is \"that's the common thread\" -- the common thread in all these things and beings which keeps them together as the world.\n\nThe Self is the common thread. Even though right now I think \"myself\" is completely different than \"yourself\" and \"herself\" and \"himself\" -- that self remains constant in all beings. I am that common thread which keeps this universe together. The analogy, obviously, is sutre manigana iva -- in the pearl necklace, beads are all separate from each other.\n\nBut the thread keeps them together as a necklace. So I am that common thread. What is common in me and you? You also call it \"myself\" when you express yourself. That self, Bhagavan said, is the common thread among all beings. And then, obviously, for people like us who can't really understand without elaborate examples --\n\nWe can only relate to something when somebody gives an example about something we know. This may still remain abstract, but then he says, \"Okay, let me explain to you how it works.\" So the next verse says: Raso aham apsu kaunteya prabhasmi shashisuryayoh pranavah sarva vedeshu shabdah khe purusham nrshu. In other words, \"Now let me enumerate things you can understand.\" I am the liquidity in water. I am the radiance in moon and sun.\n\nWhatever we think is the unique quality of that thing or being -- he said, that's because of me. Because I reside in that being or thing, it makes the thing what it is. What is dharma in Sanskrit? That which holds is dharma. As I always use the example: the dharma of sugar is sweetness. As long as it is sweet, it is sugar. It may look like sugar, it may feel like sugar, but if it doesn't taste like sugar, it's not sugar.\n\nSo the dharma of a thing or being -- what makes it what it is -- Bhagavan says that dharma is me. Because of that dharma, things and beings are what they are. Then he continues in the next verses: Punyo gandhah prithivyam cha tejash chasmi vibhavasau jivanam sarvabhuteshu tapash chasmi tapasvisu. \"I am the sweet fragrance of this earth. I'm the radiance in fire, and I'm the life in all beings.\"\n\nVery clearly he says, \"I am the life in all beings.\" Tapash chasmi tapasvisu. In other words, anything which makes anybody what it is, is me. Living beings are living because of my presence in them. It's a profound statement which we all basically know. We have accepted: Bijam mam sarvabhutanam viddhi partha sanatanam.\n\nKnow that I am the source of all beings. I am the seed of all beings. The beings cannot exist without me. Buddhir buddhimatam asmi. I am the intellect in the intellectual, the brilliance in the brilliant.\n\nSo if I think that I am so smart, my ego says, \"It's because of my intellect.\" Bhagavan says, \"Mr. Ego, you have really nothing to do with it. I am the intellect in the intellectual, and I am the brilliance in the brilliant.\" And obviously, Balam Balavatam asmi Kama Raga Vivarjitam. Here is a very interesting point he makes: I am the strength in the strong.\n\nI am the power in the powerful. But Kama Raga Vivarjitam -- that strength is devoid of desire or attachment. It is strength without any association with desire. We only desire strength if we can use it. Isn't there an expression: \"What is the use of power if I can't abuse it?\" So this is power without any desire to abuse it.\n\nThat's what we would call sattvic strength. So Bhagavan said, \"I am the strength in the strong. But when the strong misuse that strength and hurt others, that's not me.\" So this is like, you know, He very conveniently keeps out of all the trouble we get into. \"Hey Bhagavan, if you're giving this guy all this mighty power, he'll want to hurt us!\" Bhagavan says, \"I am the strength in him.\"\n\nBut I am not the one who is hurting you. Dharma Aviruddha, Bhuteshu Kamo Asmi Bharatarshapa. Now I say, okay, what happens to all these desires we have? He said, that's also me. But that is Dharma Aviruddha. We have always this argument.\n\nIs the desire good or bad? You know, Vedantic discussion. We say, yeah, but that's also our desire. I said, well, I want to do good thing. Well, that's also desire. Well, I want to meet Bhagavan.\n\nSo if you see in our tradition, when Brahmacharis go to the guru, they first shave all their hair off. That basically indicates getting rid of all desires. You're a student now, you're a seeker. You shouldn't have any other desire. But they leave a Choti -- that indicates the Shastra Vasana, the desire for knowledge.\n\nThat Choti keeps him tied to the Sastra. Then when he becomes a Sanyasi, when that Choti is gone, when you reach a level, even attachment to the Sastra should be dropped. Because otherwise I just remain a pure Pandit. That's an attachment. It's a golden chain, Bhagawan. So even that has to be dropped.\n\nSo when he becomes a Sanyasi -- Sanyasi literally means one who has renounced -- he has renounced everything, all attachment. The Choti goes away. Even Shastra Vasana is not there. That too becomes bondage, so even that needs to go.\n\nSo where do these desires stand? Bhagwan said, \"Desires are nothing but me. I am expressing through you as your desire.\" But that is Dharma Aviruddha -- not contrary to your Dharma. When you have a desire in accordance with your Dharma, that is legitimate. I am a doctor and I have a desire to help people, perform surgery, or practice my art of medicine. That's a Dharma-aligned desire.\n\nThat's not a desire which is wrong. Bhagavan said, \"I am the desire in you which is in line with your Dharma.\" If I'm a father and I want to take care of my children, that's in line with my Dharma. If I'm a teacher and I want to make sure my students learn, that's a desire in line with my Dharma. If I am a postman and I want to deliver mail, that's in line with my Dharma. Where we get confused in our understanding of Vedanta is this: Vedanta doesn't say desire is something outside of this world.\n\nWe don't import it from somewhere. It's part of your nature, part of Bhagavan's nature. But it has to align with your Dharma, without any contradiction. I'm a treasurer in a bank, but I want to become the owner of the bank by dealing under the table? That's obviously contrary to my position. So Bhagawan says, \"I am the strength in the strong, but without any attachment or desire to use this strength in a manner contrary to Dharma.\"\n\nTherefore, Bhagavan Bhagavad Gita asks Arjuna to fight. Well, is it right or wrong? Bhagavad says, it is in line with your Dharma. You are the general of this army. All these people are relying on you. You have to use your strength to fight your battle.\n\nSo the very important point is: desires are natural as long as they are in line with your duties. I want to take care of my children -- that's in line with my Dharma. Ye chaiva Sattvika Bhava Rajasas Tamasash cha ye. Whatever beings are Sattvic, Rajasic, or Tamasic -- we classify people and things into these categories by their own nature. We know, or at least we have learned from the Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita, that this world is made up of these three Gunas: Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas.\n\nEverything else we see is the permutation and combination of these three gunas. When I have four-color printing, I may have hundreds of colors on my picture, but they are nothing but the permutation and combination of the four colors. Therefore my printer will say \"yellow is out,\" and I replace the yellow.",
      "reflection": "\"I am the eternal Seed of being; I am the Intelligence of the intelligent, the Splendour of the resplendent.\" When you feel proud of your intelligence or accomplishments, pause and consider: where does that intelligence come from? Krishna gently reminds us that the intellect and the intellectual both belong to Him. This is not meant to diminish your efforts but to shift your identification. The next time you solve a problem or have a creative insight, try thinking: \"That intelligence flowing through me is the Divine expressing itself.\"\n\nKrishna makes a crucial distinction about strength and desire: \"I am the Strength of the strong, of them who are free from attachment and desire; and I am the Desire for righteousness.\" Notice that divine strength is without the craving to misuse it. Today, examine your own strengths and talents. Are you using them in alignment with your dharma, or are they mixed with selfish desire? The desire to care for your children, to excel at your profession, to serve your community, these are dharma-aviruddha, desires not contrary to righteousness. But the same strength twisted by ego becomes bondage.\n\nThe teaching that Sattvic, Rajasic, and Tamasic qualities all come from the Lord, yet He is not in them, is paradoxical but liberating. You are not your moods, your qualities, your changing states. Today, when you notice yourself becoming agitated (rajas) or dull (tamas), remember: these states arise and pass, but the witness of these states, that unchanging awareness, is your true nature. Can you rest in that witness position even briefly?"

      "commentary": "We are discussing Chapter 7, Gnana Vignana Yoga, the Yoga of Knowledge and Wisdom. In this chapter we have seen that the Lord says, \"You complain that you don't know the Lord, that you have never seen God before.\"\n\nBut I pervade this universe with my Ashta Dha Prakriti. In my Eightfold nature, I manifest in this world, and you see me every day. That is Bhumiyapo anala kam vayuhu Manabuddhi Ahankar. That's my Eightfold Prakriti. And you see me every day.\n\nThis is my lower Prakriti. Lower means the grosser manifestation which you and I can perceive through our senses. But he said, higher than that is my higher Prakriti, which is not just the sum total of all this, but something which is the cause for this entire universe. Everything comes out of me and everything goes back into me. It stays in time and space in a particular shape or form or state temporarily, but eventually it goes back to its source, which is the self -- the self which is all-pervading. Therefore there is nothing other than myself.\n\nAnything which you can see is nothing but myself. Therefore all the examples then given show that whatever you see is me. In the last verse, in the previous three verses we have seen, it says Ye chaiva Sattvika Bhava Rajasas Tamasash cha ye. Matta eveti tan viddhi na tv aham teshu te mayi. This world right now seems divided into three types of people, three types of things, three types of qualities. These are the qualities of my Maya. This illusion creates a world of plurality when only one exists -- the singularity -- and it does so by fooling my mind and intellect.\n\nI see this plurality. And I say that this illusion which I see is because of the divine Prakriti called Maya. This Maya has three aspects: Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. Sattva is pure knowledge or existence. Rajas is activity. And Tamas is inertia.\n\nThese three are absolutely required for anything to exist. The awareness that it exists, the activity, dynamism, and then inertia -- all three in different proportions, in different permutation and combination, create this world of plurality. So any being you see in this world -- whether Sattvik, Rajasik, or Tamasic -- they come from me, they are in me, but I am not in them. Now obviously, our whole life we've heard that Bhagavan is in every being. But now Bhagavan says they are in me, but I am not in them. When we discussed this verse, we used a simple analogy: the universal space says, \"I'm not in the car, but the car is in me.\"\n\nA car is traveling in space. The space inside the car -- is it in the car, or is it remaining where it is? The car is traveling in the space. We feel the space in the car; otherwise we wouldn't be able to sit in it. However, when the car moves from Hanover County to Henrico, it doesn't carry the Hanover County space to Henrico. Otherwise Henrico would have a surplus of space.\n\nThe space remains where it is. Even though in my perception it seems like the space is in the car, in reality the car is in the space. So even though it seems like Bhagavan is in me -- that's why I can speak, I can hear, I can walk -- actually I am in the Lord. As long as I keep connected with Him, I can do all of that.\n\nSo the next three verses. Verse 13: Mohitam na abhijanati mam ebhyah param avyayam.\n\nAll this elaborate explanation creates a confusion in our mind: \"So if that's the case, why don't I feel the Lord's presence? All this is great, but I don't feel it.\" Because Bhagavan says this world is deluded by the three qualities of Maya -- Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas -- which create this magnificent projection of the world. We go to a cinema theater; we know it's just a screen and light is thrown on it. But we get caught up in the images, the storyline, and the acting.\n\nWe forget completely that what's in front of us is nothing but a white screen with light projected through a lens -- that magnificent projection. So it's even more confusing for us: what is real and what is unreal? Up till now, at least with the 2D world, we could say, \"That's two-dimensional. My world is three-dimensional.\" Many years ago I went to Epcot Center, and that was the first time I'd seen a hologram. I was completely baffled.\n\nThe lady looked so real in the hologram, walking around giving a presentation. Luckily it was not full scale, so you could tell. But it's so real that our senses cannot differentiate between what is real and what is unreal. Same thing with Photoshop. Previously, when somebody sent me a picture, I knew what it was.\n\nNow somebody sends me a picture and I don't know whether it's Photoshopped or real. I'm in a party, but I was never there -- because somebody photoshopped me into it. The more the world creates these magnificent projections, the more we get deluded. The more our senses are involved, the more it confuses us from differentiating the real from the unreal. So Bhagavan said that these three qualities of His Prakriti, projected through His Prakriti --\n\nHis Prakriti's nature is this divine Maya, the divine illusion which creates multiple entities out of one. This world is deluded by this -- Mam na abhijanati mam ebhyah param avyayam -- and therefore they do not know that I am the immutable source of all beings. It is as simple as this: Bhagavan said, \"It's me. I created the confusion in your mind. I am the source of the confusion.\"\n\nSo we say, \"Well then, why are we suffering? Bhagavan, why didn't you create a simple world where everybody understands that we are part of the Lord?\" But in fact, we don't like simple things. The more confusing it is --\n\nthat's why we want 3D TV now. Up till now, we were happy with 2D TV. The more baffling it is, the more interesting. A magic trick that somebody can figure out is no longer magic -- I don't want to go see it.\n\nBut something I can't figure out? How does David Copperfield make the Statue of Liberty vanish? The whole United States tunes into the television set. More confusing, more interesting. That's what makes our life interesting. Bhagwan said, \"That's what my Leela is.\"\n\nWe get caught in the play; we lose the sense of what is real and what is unreal. So the next verse: Daivi hi esha gunamayi mama maya duratyaya. This divine Maya of mine -- Maya is divine because, after all, it is the Lord's quality. He says, \"This is my quality.\" But it is very difficult to overcome.\n\nWe know that when we go to see a magic show, almost 100% of the people in the audience know there is no real magic. He is not cutting this lady in half. But at the same token, we can't figure out how he did it. We actually had a magic show at Chinmaya Mission -- probably you may have seen this. It was a fundraiser, and they had all these acts.\n\nOne act was: they put Swamiji, Swami Dheerananda, into this box and rotated the box around. When you opened it, the Swamiji was gone and a young little kid in a swami dress came out. \"Oh, what did you do? You made Swamiji a little kid!\" Unfortunately, there were obviously two compartments and the guy switches around.\n\nBut Swamiji's saffron robe got stuck in the partition. So when the little kid comes out, we see the saffron robe, and the whole magic is gone. Everybody's laughing. We figured out Swamiji is right behind that curtain. This magic is only enjoyable as long as we can't figure it out. Once we figure it out, the magic is gone. Bhagavan says, \"I am the greatest magician, so you can't figure out my Maya.\"\n\nThis threefold Maya of mine is difficult to overcome. With a simple mind and intellect, you're trying to figure out the Lord's Maya -- your mind and intellect are not capable. Bhagavan says, you can try all your life, generations after generations, to intellectually figure out the Lord's nature. You're not going to succeed.\n\nBhagawan says, Mama Maya Duratyaya -- it is very difficult to cross over. But then we say, \"Okay, that's the end of this class. Let's close the book. Let's go home.\" Mam eva ye prapadyante mayam etam taranti te. Those who take refuge in me will cross over.\n\nThis Maya, we are all very anxious to find out. Well, the magician says, if you come and take, become my disciple, then you will figure out everything what I do. So when you go to the source and take refuge in him, if I really want to find out what David Copperfield does, I have to go and bow down and say, take me as your disciple. Let me know how you make this statue of Liberty vanishes. That's the purpose of my life. Okay, then I'll teach you.\n\nBhagavan says, Mama Maya Duratyaya -- it's very difficult to cross over if you just rely on your own intellect and mind. But if you take refuge in me -- in other words, start identifying with the self -- you will overcome that. That's the little escape hatch you have. Mam eva ye -- those who invoke me, or Bhajanti. Now, we basically think about singing Bhajans, like Swami Dheerananda.\n\nIt's not just the harmonium and tabla. Bhajanti means: anytime we have to do something, we have to invoke ourselves. When somebody asks me, \"Neel, how did you do this?\" -- \"I did it all by myself.\" I had to invoke myself to do it. For something else you might say, \"Well, no, I had a little help from this organization, but I still did it myself.\"\n\nSo I invoked the organization for some help, but I still myself is doing it. But she did it herself or something else. Well, they didn't do it, but he did it himself. Wherever there is something doing comes, there is some self involved in it. Whether it is myself, yourself, herself, themselves, itself, the self involved in it. In other words, in any activity you have to invoke self.\n\nThat self is the doer, whether it is myself or yourself or herself or himself. The self is the only doer. If there is no self involved, nothing happens. So we have to invoke the self. Now, the question is: with what instrument do we invoke it? To get the light in this room, I have to invoke electricity.\n\nSo I have to flip the switch, connect that to all the lights here and the lights come on.",
      "reflection": "\"The entire world is deluded by the three qualities (gunas) and does not recognize Me, who am beyond them and imperishable.\" This verse explains why spiritual realization seems so elusive. Like watching a captivating movie, we become so absorbed in the play of Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas that we forget we are the witness, not the movie. Today, notice how your moods shift throughout the day: clarity and peace (sattva), restlessness and ambition (rajas), heaviness and confusion (tamas). Can you observe these shifting states without being completely identified with them?\n\nKrishna offers both a warning and a promise. The warning: \"This divine Maya of Mine, consisting of the three gunas, is difficult to cross.\" The promise: \"Those who take refuge in Me alone shall cross over this illusion.\" The key word is \"alone\" (eva). Half-hearted seeking, divided attention, keeping one foot in spiritual practice and both hands grasping worldly security, this approach will not work. The magician's tricks cannot be understood from the audience; you must become his disciple. Today, honestly assess: how much of your day is spent genuinely seeking truth versus being entertained by the magic show of Maya?\n\nThe verse about those who do not seek the Divine describes them as \"deprived of spiritual perception by the glamour of Illusion.\" This is not a judgment but a diagnosis. The cure is Bhajanti, which means invoking the Self. Every action requires invoking some self: myself, yourself, itself. Today, consciously invoke the higher Self before important activities. Before a meeting, a difficult conversation, or creative work, pause and remember: \"May the Divine intelligence work through me.\""

      "commentary": "We have been discussing Chapter 7, Gnana Vignana Yoga, the Yoga of Knowledge and Wisdom. As we discussed, in Chapter 6 we learned how to meditate. In Chapter 7, he is teaching us what to meditate upon. In Chapter 6, we learned how to identify with the Supreme Self and detach ourselves from the limited self that I consider myself. In Chapter 7, Bhagavan is giving us the indications of how to think about the Supreme Being. We have seen his lower and higher nature.\n\nThe lower nature is what I can see, perceive, think in this world -- this is the lower Prakriti. So Bhagavan said, he is all-pervading, and anything which I see, I should see his presence in it. Anything which I consider conducive or not conducive is still manifestation of the same underlying reality. This Prakriti has three Gunas: Sattva, Rajas, Tamas. Whatever there is which is Sattvik, Rajasik or Tamasik, consider that all come from me, the supreme reality.\n\nIt is actually my mind which divides this world into three different categories. The world I see as Sattvik, the world I see as Rajasic, the world I see as Tamasic. That makes me think about positive emotions: where I feel happy, I feel that's a Sattvic world. The world which makes me agitated, I consider Rajasic. The world which confuses me is Tamasic for me. But no matter what world you are identifying with, that is your world and you are in the center of it.\n\nBut consider that comes from me. All sense objects in this world, whether they give you Sattvic experience, rajasic experience or Tamasic experience, they all come from me. But I am not in them, they are in me. In other words, there is no indication of supreme reality in them. I cannot find its presence in them in those sense objects. But note that all sense objects are in me.\n\nIn other words, without that supreme reality, without my consciousness, I will not be able to detect any of those sense objects. Therefore, all the sense objects in this world are actually in my consciousness. Consider that they are all present because of my presence as your own consciousness. Then Bhagawan explains why we cannot realize that. Because all people, all beings in this world are confused by this Maya. As we have discussed, Maya is that which is not, but appears to be.\n\nThe world of sense objects is actually created by my own mind. The impression I have of them is actually my impression only. I will never know what the reality is. When I look up into the sky, I see stars and moon and sun. What I see is my world -- the impression I see is the representation of this world in my mind.\n\nI will never know what the reality is. So Bhagawan said, consider all that to be me. But you will never be able to cross this illusion that you have created about your world. This knowledge about the underlying reality is lost to me because I'm under the spell of Maya. I do not see the unity in the diversity of sense objects around me, because I consider myself an island by myself.\n\nI am so unique that I'm different than this world. This notion about my uniqueness creates this duality about I and the world. Because that's the my illusion that the Maya's illusion. Even knowing, through intellectual appreciation, that my body, my mind, my intellect are part of this Prakriti -- this body is nothing but food modified.\n\nBut I never see my body as food modified. I always see my body as something very unique. Bhagwan said, that's the confusion created by Maya. Tribhir gunamayair bhavair ebhih sarvam idam jagat mohitam -- the entire Jagat, all beings, are confused by the three Gunas. But those who have some inkling about this underlying reality will pursue it.\n\nThat's basically I'm worshipping. I'm trying to find out and identify with the supreme self. I have inkling that there is something higher than me and that I am pursuing. So Bhagavan now tells us which types of people will try to identify with the supreme self. In the last verse we discussed, he said: who will not be aware of something greater than his own self? Na mam dushkritino mudhah prapadyante naradhamah, mayaya apahrita jnana, asuram bhavam ashritah. Those who are under the complete spell of Maya will only identify with the ignorance they have.\n\nThis ignorance that \"I am by myself and the world is a completely different entity.\" Duskritina, Mudha -- people who are not yet evolved to the point of identifying with something higher than their limited self. They will not be able to understand this, and therefore they take refuge in their own ignorance: \"I am who I am; the world is out there to get me.\"\n\nIn contrast, Bhagavan said there are people who have evolved from identifying with their limited self and have recognized an underlying unity in all sense objects. They see that everything is strung into the same reality.\n\nPhysics tells us the same thing -- that in this world there is one underlying energy. And in this world nothing is lost. No matter what incident or phenomenon is happening, we know that energy in this world remains constant. If you take a gallon of water and boil it until it all evaporates, that does not mean that the water is lost. The same amount of energy which was in the water -- the mass -- is now converted into something else. When you add all that up, it will come to exactly the same amount.\n\nThat's what we learned in high school physics. The Bhagawan said that you in this world there is nothing is really lost or gained. It just changes appearances. And those who have come to the realization that there is an underlying reality, they will pursue identification with that reality. And those people: Chaturvidha bhajante mam janah sukritino Arjuna. Contrast this with the last verse.\n\nThe wrongdoers, in essence, are acting in this world with the wrong notion that their own self is the only reality. Charvaka darshan: Bhasmi bhutasya dehasya punaragamanam kutah -- when this body is burnt, there is no coming back. So this life is the only life; enjoy as best as you can, no matter what you have to do. Rinam kritva ghritam pibet.\n\nThose are Duskritina because they have a very narrow view about who they are, and therefore their actions are driven by that paradigm -- \"I am by myself and have to make the most out of this life.\" Bhagavan calls them Maya Apahrita Jnana: their knowledge about the self and their connection with the higher self is lost because of the confusion created by Maya.\n\nChaturvidha bhajanti mam janah sukritina Arjuna. In contrast, the people of good deeds pursue me.\n\nThey try to identify with me in four different ways. Or you can say there are four different types of people who identify with me. This can also be one person in four different states of pursuing the supreme reality: Artah, Jijnasu, Artharthi, Gnani -- O Bharatarshabha, best of the Bharat clan. There are four types. The first is Artah, the one who is in distress and looking for help.\n\nBut there is a slight distinction people have made in understanding this verse. Bhagavan has called them Sukritina. Also, in the next two verses, he will attach the word Udara to them -- the noble people who are trying to understand why things are the way they are. We have seen that for people who are working only for themselves, all actions are binding. Any action which binds me is Dushkrita.\n\nAny action which liberates me is Sukrita. So in the last verse, the wrongdoers -- all their actions were binding, getting more and more deeply into the bondage of their egos. In contrast, these people are Sukritina. All their actions are towards liberation from their false identification.\n\nSo this Artah may not be an average person in distress seeking Bhagavan's help -- \"I'm in trouble, help me; I have back pain, please help me.\" He's trying to understand why there is distress in this world, why people are suffering, and he's seeking the Lord's guidance on how to alleviate that suffering. During the pandemic, a person may have been very safe in his house, in a location where he's not going to get infected.\n\nBut just watching people suffer, you may think, \"Oh Lord, why are you not removing all this suffering and helping those in this pandemic?\" Bhagavan said, that's the Artah -- a Bhakta who is pursuing me, disturbed by distress, seeking understanding.\n\nThe next is the Jijnasu. He wants to know how this world works, why there is suffering. It may be at a personal level -- when I'm in distress, I'm trying to find out why there is sorrow in my life.\n\nWhat is it that I'm not doing right which makes me sorrowful? But at a greater level, the Bhakta is trying to understand why people are suffering and trying to find the answer. Bhagavan Buddha was not upset about his own situation. He was well protected in the palace, but he saw the suffering outside. He said, \"I need to find the cause for this suffering.\" Bhagawan said, that's a Jijnasu.\n\nThen the third type, Bhagawan said, is the Artharthi -- one who is seeking wealth. We all fall into that category. We do Lakshmi Puja on Diwali because we want to make sure the next year will be as good or better than the last. But this Artharthi is not seeking just for himself. These people are seeking wealth so that they can help others.\n\nThey want to create wealth for the betterment of society so that sorrows can be eliminated. And the last one is the Gnani, who has truly understood the relationship between his limited self and the Supreme Self. Bhagavan in the next verse says he is the best: Sa cha mama priyah. Out of these four, they are all selfless workers. They have gone through the first six chapters of Bhagavad Gita and learned the art of Karma Yoga.\n\nThey're working in this world for the greater good, but they still have questions: why is there suffering, where does it come from, what can I do to alleviate it? \"Oh Lord, give enough so everyone can eat and nobody goes hungry.\"\n\nBut the Gnani understands that his own limited self is none other than the Supreme Self. They are one and the same, connected with each other, only separated by conditioning. Nitya Yukta -- constantly establishing their knowledge. No matter what I see outside, the Self is pervading all throughout this world. Whether people are suffering or enjoying, it is the same reality expressing itself. Eka Bhakti Vishishyate -- single-pointedly identified with that, because there is nothing else to identify with, once he has realized that his self is not different from the Supreme Self.",
      "reflection": "Krishna identifies four types of devotees who turn to the Divine: the distressed (arta), the curious seeker of knowledge (jijnasu), the seeker of wealth (artharthi), and the wise one (jnani). Today, honestly identify which category best describes your current spiritual motivation. There is no shame in any of these; Krishna calls all of them \"sukritina\" (people of good deeds) and \"noble.\" The distressed person who cries out to God in a hospital bed is on the same path as the philosopher seeking ultimate truth. The key is that all four are turning toward the Divine rather than away from it.\n\nYet Krishna makes clear that the jnani, the one who truly knows, is dearest to Him: \"For the wise man I am exceedingly beloved and the wise man, too, is beloved by Me.\" This is not favoritism but natural law. The closer you come to understanding someone, the deeper your love becomes. The jnani has removed the veil of separateness and sees that \"Vasudevah sarvam,\" Vasudeva is everything. This recognition creates single-pointed devotion (eka-bhakti) naturally, not through effort.\n\nReflect on your own journey: Have you moved through these stages? Perhaps you first came to spirituality during a crisis (arta), then developed curiosity about how life works (jijnasu), then sought divine help for worldly goals (artharthi). Each stage is valid and necessary. The invitation today is to ask: \"What would it mean to move toward jnana, toward actually knowing rather than just believing?\" One practice: Choose one teaching from the Gita and contemplate it deeply throughout the day, not just intellectually accepting it, but testing it against your actual experience."

      "commentary": "We have been discussing Chapter 7, Gnana Vignana Yoga, the Yoga of Knowledge and Wisdom. We have seen in Bhagavad Gita so far that Bhagavan taught us Gnana Yoga, the Yoga of Knowledge or Path of Knowledge. In Chapter 2, Sankhya Yoga, we learned that our self is immortal, imperishable -- though we consider ourselves to be mortal. So that was the path of knowledge revealing the nature of the self. Then from Chapters 3 to 5 we learned Karma Yoga, the Path of Action -- how we can transform our day-to-day actions into selfless activities and purify our mind and intellect. So Karma Yoga is to develop equanimity and purification of the mind.\n\nThat's the Path of Action. And in Chapter 6, Bhagavan taught us Dhyana Yoga, the Yoga of Meditation -- how we can shift our mind from identifying with this limited self (this body, this mind, this intellect that I consider to be my own self). In Chapter 2, we learned that the all-pervading, omniscient, ever-existing Self, which is of the nature of Sat-Chit-Ananda, is nothing but my own self as the universal Self. What I consider \"myself\" right now is conditioned consciousness -- the same consciousness conditioned by what I call body, mind, and intellect. So we learned how to shift this identification from the limited self to the higher Self through Dhyana Yoga by focusing the mind on the supreme Self.\n\nAt the end of Chapter 6, Bhagavan declared that the Yogi -- one who has tuned his mind to the Supreme Self, who has shifted identification from the limited self to the higher Self -- is greater than the Tapasvi (one practicing austerities), greater than the Jnani (one who has acquired knowledge through study of scriptures), and greater than the Karmi (one who acts in this world thinking that doing good is good enough). Bhagavan clarified that doing good is not good enough. You have to have the clear understanding that \"myself\" is not this limited self, but the limited self is nothing but the expression of the Supreme Self.\n\nThe three paths which are described in our system -- Karma Yoga, Gnana Yoga and Bhakti Yoga -- need to be practiced serially. Therefore, the Gita starts with Karma Yoga. Now in Chapter 7, Bhagavan is instructing us how to practice the Path of Bhakti, the path of devotion. But before I can start practicing Bhakti Yoga, I have to develop that identification with the supreme Self. Without knowing that supreme Self, I will not be able to focus my limited mind, which is right now fully identified with this limited self, onto that supreme self which is limitless.\n\nSo Bhagavan in the opening of this chapter gives Arjuna assurance: I will teach you. I will tell you how to do that. Bhagavan opens the chapter by saying Yogam yunjan mat ashrayah -- tune your mind to me. My mind right now is fully tuned with this body, identified with the limited self. That mind has to now identify with the Supreme Self.\n\nHe said, once you do that, you will come to know me. And he assured us that he will teach both the knowledge and its application -- Gnanam, the Knowledge, and Vignana, Vishishta Gnanam, its application in your life -- without leaving anything behind. Having known that, you will not have to know anything else. In other words, having known myself in its true nature, there will be no need to achieve, accomplish, or acquire anything to find that ultimate happiness -- the happiness which has no limitation. I do not want to be unhappy at any given time.\n\nIf you ask me, \"When do you want to be happy?\" -- it is not okay to be happy during weekdays but unhappy during weekends. I want to be happy all seven days of the week, 365 days of the year. Bhagwan says, having known that your self is not the limited self, you shall achieve that ultimate happiness. Why are people not achieving this knowledge? He said, Manushyanam -- out of thousands of human beings on this planet, someone will try to achieve this perfection.\n\nWe can now say billions of people -- out of billions, very few will try this method of achieving perfect happiness by identifying with the Supreme. And of those who are striving, there are very few. Out of billions, maybe a few hundred or a few dozen are trying this. And he says: Yatatam api siddhanam kashchin mam vetti tattvatah -- even those who are striving sincerely, only very few will achieve this perfection.\n\nSo this almost looks like Bhagavan is discouraging us. But Bhagavan is not discouraging us. Bhagavan is saying that it is an equal opportunity goal. Anyone can achieve this goal if they try in an appropriate manner. So Bhagavan then describes the people who are striving to achieve identification with the Supreme Self. He calls them my devotees, my Bhakti.\n\nAnd he classifies those devotees into four categories. In general, he divided the entire human race into two categories. One, those who are striving for perfection. Those who are not striving for perfection. Those who are striving for perfection are trying to develop some kind of relationship with the Supreme. Others are simply considering that this world is where I can find my happiness.\n\n\"I work outside, I go and acquire things, I go and accomplish things, and that will give me happiness.\" This group of people is not even trying to develop any relationship with the Supreme. He called them Duskritina -- which does not mean they are evildoers, but they are working towards their happiness in a wrong way that will guarantee their failure. He defines the other group as Sukritina, people of good deeds. He says they are his devotees.\n\nBut they fall into four different categories, and therefore not all of them will achieve perfection. The first is Artah -- one who reaches out to the Supreme, developing some relationship with Him due to distress. There is sorrow in his life or her life, or there is sorrow all around. He wants to know how invoking God's grace will alleviate that sorrow.\n\nWe only invoke His grace when we feel helpless. \"I can solve my own problem.\" It's only when we feel helpless that we seek help from the higher Self. They are my devotees, but they have a limited relationship -- they only seek my help when they feel helpless.\n\nIt's like my son when he was in college. He would only call me when he really needed something. Otherwise, he was happy doing whatever he was doing. We'd have to call him and say, \"Bhai, you didn't call us all month.\" But when he needs something, he suddenly remembers, \"My parents are there to take care of me. Let me call dad\" -- and dad sends more money.\n\nSo that relationship is still of a son and a father. \"My Father in heaven will take care of me when I really need Him.\" The next is the Jijnasu -- one who is curious about the nature of the Supreme. All scientists actually fall in that category, because they're trying to find that God equation, the equation which will reveal the nature of the Creator who created this universe. Out of curiosity about the nature of the self, the supreme, the ultimate reality, they are developing a relationship with Him.\n\nThen the third, Bhagavan says, is the Artharthi. The entire wealth on this planet is created by the Supreme Being, and therefore He is the owner. When I need wealth to support myself, my family, my community, my nation, I seek His help.\n\nOn our dollar bill it says, \"In God we trust.\" That Bhakta seeking wealth is an Artharthi. And the last one is the Jnani -- one who has developed this relationship with the Supreme by understanding His real nature, shifting identification from the limited self to the higher Self.\n\nThe higher Self is my true self; this limited self is just a reflection of it. Bhagavan said the Jnani is the one closest to Him. Udarah sarva evaite jnani tu atma eva me matam. All my devotees are noble people. They're people doing good deeds.\n\nThey are on the right path. I may start developing a relationship with Bhagavan because I feel distressed, but eventually I will progress to where I understand His true nature. It's like knowing somebody -- just knowing a little bit, we start liking them more. The closer we come, the more we know them in detail. Ultimately, we know that person almost in totality.\n\nSo Bhagawan said, all these devotees of mine are noble people. However, the Jnani I consider to be my own self. He is no different than me. Asthitah sa hi yuktatma mam eva anuttamam gatim. By steadfastly establishing his mind in me, he comes to me.\n\nBut then he says something which discourages many of us: Bahunam janmanam ante jnanavaan mam prapadyate, Vasudevah sarvam iti sa mahatma sudurlabhah. This Jnani has not become a Jnani overnight. After going through this journey of knowing the Supreme Self for many, many lives, he comes to understand the nature of the Supreme. And he realizes that there is nothing in this universe --\n\nthere is nothing in this Prakriti which is other than Vasudeva -- Vasudeva, the supreme, all-pervading Self. So Bhagavan said, \"I told you in the beginning that Prakriti is my lower nature, my manifest nature which one can experience through the senses -- I can see, I can touch, I can feel. But other than this manifest nature of mine, there is a higher nature which is unmanifest, which you have to experience.\"\n\nOnly then will you come to know. So after many births of trying to seek unity in diversity, such a Jnani achieves the understanding that the supreme Self is everywhere. Sa Mahatma sudurlabhah -- such a great soul is very rare to find. So we come to the conclusion that this is not something I can easily achieve.\n\nBut come to think of it, there's nothing in this life we achieve in any other way. We have to start somewhere and then gradually make progress one step at a time. We have learned that in elementary school somebody asked me, what do you want to become? I want to become a doctor. It does not make you become doctor the next day. It took you a long time.\n\nFrom elementary school to secondary school to high school to college, then medical school, then internship. All that effort you put for many, many, many years. And then you achieved this status as doctor. Such and such people recognize you as doctor. You practice your art of medicine. All that is only possible because of the journey you started from your kindergarten which ended into your internship in some hospital.\n\nBhagavan says bahūnām janmanāmante, the jñānī which you see today. As a knowledgeable person. He did not achieve the knowledge overnight. He put his efforts into it. So Bhagawan is encouraging us. No matter where we are in our journey, we keep making progress one step at a time.\n\nBut then the caution here is we may get distracted.",
      "reflection": "\"After many births, the wise one realizes Me, understanding 'Vasudeva is all.' Such a great soul is very rare to find.\" This verse can either discourage or inspire. The key is understanding that every journey, no matter how long, is completed one step at a time. You did not become a professional overnight; years of education and practice were required. Similarly, spiritual maturity develops through consistent effort across time. Today, rather than lamenting how far you have to go, appreciate how far you have already come. What spiritual insights do you now hold that you did not have five or ten years ago?\n\nKrishna then addresses those whose knowledge is stolen by desires, who worship lesser powers. This is not a condemnation of diverse worship but an observation about limitation. If I worship only the god of wealth, I limit my vision to wealth. If I worship only health, my horizon stops there. Each deity represents a facet of the one Reality. Today, notice what you functionally worship through your time, attention, and energy. Is it career success, family security, social approval, physical pleasure? These are not wrong, but are they your ultimate goal, or stepping stones toward something greater?\n\nThe beautiful teaching that Krishna strengthens the faith of every sincere seeker, regardless of the form of worship, is profoundly inclusive. Whatever path genuinely draws your heart toward the sacred, pursue it with full conviction. The caution is to eventually recognize that all paths lead to the same summit. Today's practice: If you follow a particular tradition or form of worship, honor it fully while remaining open to the truth that others who worship differently are also reaching toward the same ultimate Reality."

      "commentary": "We have been discussing Chapter 7, the Yoga of Knowledge and Wisdom. We have seen that Bhagavan said, consciously or unconsciously, we are all seeking the Lord. We are all seeking who we are, where we came from.\n\nSome of us seek unconsciously and some consciously. Those who seek unconsciously obviously do not know where the answer is. Those who seek consciously are worshipping the Lord, the source of their being. We have seen that seekers can be classified into four types. Of these four, the Gnani is so firm in his conviction that his self is something other than the limited self. We need to find out what that is. But the journey from ignorance about the self to knowing the self takes its own effort.\n\nBahunam janmanam ante jnanavaan mam prapadyate. After many years of sincere seeking, the Gnani who is sincerely seeking his own self finds the truth. He comes to the conclusion: Vasudevah sarvam iti -- there is nothing other than the supreme reality. There is no separate world and there is no separate \"I.\"\n\nAll that exists is Vasudeva. Anything that I see, touch, feel, or perceive is nothing but that one supreme reality alone. But Bhagavan said, why don't we all realize this? Kamaih taih taih hrita jnanah -- because of this desire and that desire, the knowledge which is inherently ours is taken away from us. And therefore we seek the fulfiller of that desire.\n\nWho do I go and meet at a party? The one I think is going to be the most beneficial to me. Networking parties, I'm talking about. Somebody may come very lovingly and say, \"Neil!\" I say, \"No, no, not right now. I need to go and talk to that guy, because that's where I think my benefit lies.\"\n\nEven at a social party, we go say hello first to whoever we think is most important. With this desire and that desire, our sense of who we are is looted away. And then we seek the fulfiller of that desire. That's the Devata -- the one we consider the fulfiller. The object of our desire becomes the Devata we worship.\n\nAnd Bhagavan says, whatever your desire and whoever your Devata, it eventually comes from me alone. Whatever you have faith in -- that entity, that source will fulfill your desire. \"I make your faith even firmer.\" Where does the faith come from? Faith comes from my own attachment and understanding. My own consciousness, my own thinking, is only possible because the Supreme functions through me as consciousness. The same consciousness which allows me to think makes me think over and over in the same line of thinking.\n\nIt makes my faith firmer and firmer the more I think in that line. \"Only science can give me the answer.\" The more I indulge in that thought, the firmer my faith becomes. \"All these sadhus and swamis are nonsense.\" Swamiji himself said that's how he started -- \"These guys are just bluffing their way.\" So the more we think in the same line, the firmer our faith becomes through our own consciousness. Bhagawan says, \"I make their faith firm.\"\n\nAnd then, the more they worship that Devata, the more they fulfill that desire sincerely. Whenever I apply myself in whatever field, the success comes from that field. Bhagavan said, wherever you apply yourself with faith, your desires will be fulfilled.\n\nHowever, he said, all that comes from me alone. Sa taya shraddhaya yuktah tasya aradhanam ihate labhate cha tatah kaman maya eva vihitan hi tan. No matter where you think this profit came from, where you think this success came from, no matter who you think helped you -- Bhagavan said, that was your faith making you think it came from that source. However, because I am the all-pervading Lord, everything coming to you from these different Devatas is coming from me alone.\n\nI am the only source. Those in business, you have several accounts and LLCs. You transfer money from here and there. Eventually, whose money is it? Yours. Anytime we go out and do something, Mina asks, \"How are you going to pay for this?\" I say, \"Oh, that's for NBJS.\" She thinks the money is coming from NBJS, who is paying the rent here. \"Then I don't have to worry about it.\" As long as you don't think it's coming from me -- but eventually it all comes from me, right?\n\nAt the time, I feel it didn't come from the Lord; it came from this Devata, this source. Bhagavan says all the sources eventually merge into me. Wherever you are, whatever Devata you are worshipping, wherever the results come from, they all come from me. Apply yourself in a field of productive potential and you shall get results. But know that all these results come from me. Antavattu phalam tesham tat bhavati alpamedhasam.\n\nBut the Alpa Medhas, those with limited intellect, get finite results. Antavattu -- which has an end. No matter how hard I try for something and get it, the joy will only last for a certain period of time. My standard example: buying a BMW. You bought the BMW, and that joy has ended. The pursuit has its own charm.\n\nOnce you reach the destination, the whole excitement of the journey has ended. Whatever Devatas you are worshipping, certainly you will get success in that field. But the results are finite -- they have a beginning and an end. I want to see a Broadway show I have never seen in my life. Next time I'm in New York, I want to see it.\n\nBut it has a beginning and an end. The show starts and ends. After that, I'm back to square one. Bhagawan said, these people with limited intellect think their destination lies in finite happiness. Therefore they pursue this field of finite happiness, and they get it.\n\nDevan devayajo yanti mad bhakta yanti mam api. Those seeking small gains get small gains. The one who wants to hit the jackpot strives for that and reaches there sooner or later. Bhagavan said, the Bhaktas of various Devatas -- all of us who have this desire and that -- continuously pursue them. And because we put in our efforts, we get them.\n\nBut Bhagavan says, the one who seeks me finds me -- as simple as that. Gandhiji could have been the most successful barrister in South Africa and could have made all that money like the other Gujaratis at the time. But he wasn't happy with that finite result. We would have never heard about Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. \"Successful barrister, practiced in Durban and died.\" We would have had nothing to do with him.\n\nBut he wasn't going after the small results. He was going after what he thought rightfully belongs to his countrymen. So he became immortal. He got what he sought after. That's why I say be careful in what you think you want. You have this unlimited potential of realizing yourself.\n\nBut we are happy with small results in our life. Even in Sadhana, they say when you start meditating, Siddhis come to you, and you're pretty happy with that. A good example is Yoga. In this country, Yoga is only for the physical. Patanjali didn't write the Yoga Sutras just to make your body fit.\n\nHe wrote it to achieve the highest. But we are pretty happy with the little results we get. Therefore Bhagawan says they have a limited intellect regarding where their happiness lies. They pursue fields of action, fields of potential gain, and they get results. But those results have a beginning and an end. Inherently we are seeking infinite happiness, but we are applying ourselves in very small, finite fields of action and expecting to get infinite happiness.\n\nAnd therefore we oscillate between sorrow and happiness, sorrow and happiness. Mad Bhakta Yanti Mam Api -- only my worshipper, the one who has decided that these small gains are not good enough, who needs to find the ultimate truth that gives infinite happiness.\n\nThe last verse says: Avyaktam vyaktim apannam manyante mam abuddhayah.\n\nThose with no intellect to understand the truth -- all of us who have no capacity to understand it. Because the intellect is the only instrument we use to understand things, and the intellect is a byproduct of ignorance. Ignorance creates this perception that \"this limited being is me.\" This \"me\" -- the body, mind, and intellect -- is a product of Avidya, ignorance.\n\n\"This mind is me, this intellect is me.\" That intellect is now trying to find out who the Lord is. \"I'm going to figure it out by reading Bhagavad Gita, then the Bible, then the Quran. In the end, I'll tell you who the Lord is.\" Bhagavan said, those Abuddhayah -- they think that the Avyakta, the unmanifest, has manifested. The Lord pervading everywhere whom we can't really see, who is the substratum without which this universe cannot exist, but who is not perceptible -- they think He manifests.\n\nAnd therefore we have all these Bhajans about Bhagavan coming: \"Maine aapko dekha, Bhagavan.\" And then we have stories about Bhagavan appearing. If Bhagavan can come stand in front of me while I am also standing here and the rest of the world is also standing -- where is that unmanifest?\n\nTherefore he said, only the one without that understanding thinks the unmanifest can manifest. The unmanifest remains unmanifest. But I am seeking that, so I say, \"Oh no, this is Bhagavan.\" I think one of the Bal Vihar children had probably seen pictures of swamis in his house.\n\nSo when Swami Dheerananda was here, the child came to our house and then went back and said, \"Mom, God came to Meenanti's house!\" Because to the little child, a Swami wearing a saffron robe is God. The picture he has seen is Bhagavan. \"God came to Meenanti's house.\" What does Mama say? \"No, no, that's not God. That's Swami Dheerananda.\"\n\nFor the child, the unmanifested God has manifested. The mother said, \"No, no, that's just Dheerananda.\" We, in our limited intellect, think that God manifests as Jesus, as Krishna. But Bhagwan said, I remain unmanifest all the time. Param bhavam ajanantah mama avyayam anuttamam.\n\nKnowing a guru, knowing a prophet, and thinking, \"This is it.\" Swamiji said, \"If that's the case, whoever went to a temple and saw the Murti would never have to find any truth -- he found Bhagavan! And anybody who found a guru would never have to do anything -- he already found the truth.\" He said, \"No, they are just indications. The unmanifest remains unmanifest.\"\n\nOur limited senses, mind, and intellect have no capacity ever to understand it.",
      "reflection": "\"The fruit that comes to men of limited insight is finite.\" This simple statement contains the key to understanding human dissatisfaction. We pursue finite goals expecting infinite satisfaction. The BMW brings joy, but it ends. The promotion brings pride, but it fades. The vacation provides relaxation, but we return to the same mind we left with. Today, examine your current pursuits: Are you investing tremendous energy in achieving something that, by its very nature, cannot provide lasting fulfillment? This is not to say you should abandon worldly goals, but recognize them for what they are, finite rewards from finite efforts.\n\nKrishna distinguishes between those who worship lesser powers (devas) and those who worship Him directly: \"They who worship the lesser Powers attain them; but those who worship Me come unto Me alone.\" The practical application is this: whatever you consistently give your attention to, you become. Worship of money makes you wealthy but not necessarily happy. Worship of fame makes you known but not necessarily at peace. Worship of the Supreme, the unchanging Reality behind all changing forms, leads to that same unchanging peace within yourself.\n\nThe verse about the ignorant thinking the Unmanifested has taken human form challenges our comfortable religious notions. If God is omnipresent, how can He be limited to any single form? This does not deny the value of divine incarnations or teachers but invites us beyond form-worship to essence-recognition. Today's contemplation: What if every person you meet is equally a manifestation of the Divine? Not just the saints and sages, but the confused, the suffering, even those who harm others? Can you glimpse the unmanifest presence wearing these countless disguises?"

      "commentary": "We have been discussing Chapter 7, Gnana Vignana Yoga, the Yoga of Knowledge and Wisdom -- knowledge about the Supreme Self, contemplating on which we can attain wisdom. In this chapter, from verses 4 through 7, Bhagavan gave a thumbnail sketch of who the Lord is and what to meditate upon. First, he said his manifest Prakriti is Eightfold, available to us for perception through our senses -- everything we can think of, see, touch, and feel. All experiences of body, mind, and intellect are part of His manifested Prakriti. But then he said there is also His higher Prakriti, the para Prakriti.\n\nIn other words, that which is not available to us for cognition through our senses. Therefore it's called unmanifest -- not available to thinking through my mind, thinking through my intellect, or perceiving through my senses. The lower Prakriti is what I can interact with. The higher I cannot perceive.\n\nBut that higher is the basis of all manifestation, without which the world which you and I know will not exist. If I'm not conscious about my world, does the world exist? It only exists because I'm aware of it. The known only exists when the Knower is there. Because the Knower is there, the world of known things and beings exists. So therefore Bhagavan said, my Higher Prakriti is the one which is stringing all these manifestations together.\n\nWhat you perceive, what I perceive, what he perceives, what she perceives -- when you put all perception together, it is a world of beings. That's His real nature. So from verses 4 through 7, we've seen the identity of the Lord, the Supreme, our Self, and how to contemplate on it. And then Bhagavan said you can perceive Him through anything which is the essence of anything.\n\nBrilliance in the brilliant. Swamiji used to say, \"I am the kick in whiskey.\" What is whiskey if there is no kick in it? It may look like whiskey, it may taste like whiskey, but if there is no kick, it's not whiskey. That which makes things and beings what they are -- that is who I am. Then he said that people who have no discriminating intellect to pursue this will never pursue it, never want to think about it.\n\nBut there are people who are pursuing an understanding of the very nature of the self and trying to get over their limitations. We have seen four types of devotees: Artah, Jijnasu, Artharthi, and Gnani. The Gnani is very close to me. He has come close to understanding what the self is all about. To Arjuna: therefore, become a Gnani.\n\nTherefore, pursue the path of knowledge which makes you realize who you are. And then he also said that in our delusion, we sometimes think the unmanifest comes into manifestation. But the unmanifest never manifests -- we only feel it has. Bhagavan Vedvyasa makes this point very clear here, because we have all this fighting about different religions.\n\nWe say, \"Our Bhagavan manifested as Krishna. Yours manifested as Christ, but mine is greater than yours.\" The very first ignorance is thinking the unmanifest comes into manifest. The unmanifest will never come into manifestation. Anyone who has used his intellect knows: every religion says God is omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent.\n\nThen how can your God be different than mine? If my God is omnipresent, there is no room for another God. Knowing this, why are we fighting about whose God is greater? Abuddhayah -- without using my intellect, I think the unmanifest God comes into manifestation as an incarnation, a prophet, a sage. Param bhavam ajanantah.\n\nThey are not aware of my real nature. My real nature is Avyayam -- immutable. Bhagavan created this world out of His own self because He has no other material available. Did He ever mutate into this world? He never mutated into this world. Therefore, one who does not know that His nature is immutable --\n\nhe is the one who is fighting about it. There is nothing higher than that. There is nothing beyond His existence. If you take Him out, nothing remains. If you put everything together, there is nothing but Him alone. But see, that's not available to all of us.\n\nTo perceive my own self is what I'm trying to understand. How can it be that difficult? It is difficult because: Na aham prakasah sarvasya yogamaya samavritah. I am not available to all because my real nature is veiled by Yoga Maya. This Yoga Maya, which creates the world of plurality out of these three gunas, confuses us so we can't see His real nature. Mudho ayam na abhijanati loko mam ajam avyayam.\n\nDeluded by that Yoga Maya, I do not recognize its very nature, which is unborn and immutable. That is where our whole problem starts -- our sorrows and limitations. This Yoga Maya is the power with which He created this universe. The perception of plurality is because of this Yoga Maya. It is like when I'm dreaming: out of my own mental power, I create my own world and delude myself. I create my own world, but I -- the waker -- remain immutable. In that dream, the waking self remains unchanged.\n\nI remain Ajah in my dream. I never take birth as Bill Gates, but I feel in my dream that I'm Bill Gates. So he said, that is not available to all. Nobody will ever know it. But this is not a statement to discourage us -- it is a statement for us to contemplate on.\n\nHe said it is available to those who contemplate His real nature and cross over this Maya, who see beyond it -- therefore the word Divya Drishti. I have one perspective about this world right now, and I can change my perspective when I get greater knowledge. Before I came to Richmond, I had one perspective. I thought, \"Oh, Richmond is a very conservative southern town.\"\n\nAn old-boy network type of town. It seemed so far away in the south from Washington D.C. where I used to live -- it's only 100 miles, but I thought it was way down in the deep south. My company kept telling me, \"You need to move to Richmond.\" Until I came here and recognized this is a pretty cosmopolitan town. The more knowledge I get, the better my perspective becomes.\n\nIt becomes more encompassing. So Bhagavan said, one who does not have this perspective will not know my nature. We will need a Divya Drishti to see His real nature in totality. Mudha means one who has not yet developed that perspective -- who doesn't yet see the totality of the Lord's nature.\n\nTherefore, we learned from verses 4 through 7 how to see Him in totality. There is nothing separate from anything else. We are not islands by ourselves. We are connected in a way that we can never separate ourselves from each other. You can't have this class without any one of you. We need all of you, including myself, to have this class.\n\nBut if I miss that perspective, I am a Mudha. A father cannot be a father without a son or daughter. A daughter cannot be a daughter without father and mother. This interdependence we have right from birth is what we miss because of our ego. Then we say, \"I am a self-made man.\" You couldn't even breathe on your own.\n\nSo Bhagavan said: Vedaham samatitani vartamanani cha Arjuna bhavishyani cha bhutani. \"I know all beings of past, present, and future.\" But mam tu veda na kashchana -- \"no one knows me.\" It's a real hide-and-seek game. The one at the top, with a greater perspective, sees everything, but we can't see Him.\n\nSwamiji elaborates on why He knows everyone. It's like Krishna saying, \"I know all beings in the past, present, and future, but no one knows me.\" It's like the space in Henrico County claiming tomorrow, \"I know all the buildings in Henrico County past, present, and future.\" Because no building is possible without the inherent ingredient of space in it. From space's perspective, no building is unknown.\n\nFrom a building's perspective, I only know the conditioned space. Therefore I think I'm limited. I have birth, I have death. I don't know what is the real nature of the space. I think the nature of the space is the room. So all of us, as soon as we take this identification, we forget the real nature of ourselves and take the identification of the conditioning.\n\nBut from the perspective of consciousness -- the same consciousness in me as in you, as in him, as was in my father, my grandfather, my ancestors 5,000 years ago -- the same consciousness. Therefore, from consciousness's perspective, it knew all beings in the past, present, and future. Because it never changed; it remained what it is. Beings and their conditioning came and went and will come and go, but the inherent ingredient, the entity which makes it all possible, remains the same. So we know God is omnipresent.\n\nNone of us somehow doubt it. That which is omnipresent, by its very nature, becomes omniscient. If I am all-pervading in this space, I know everything about it. So Bhagavan is omnipresent and therefore omniscient. But from a narrow perspective, if I try to understand Bhagavan, it will never be possible. Therefore He says, Mam tu veda na kashchana.\n\nBecause we try to personify Him as a limited entity. Therefore, North Indian Rama looks North Indian and South Indian Rama looks South Indian. The artist paints it in his imagination. We see Bhagavan in our imagination. We put all our conditioning on Him.\n\nTherefore Bhagavan says, \"No one knows me.\" We have to cross over these limitations of our mind and intellect. Therefore it's called transcendental meditation. Iccha dvesha samutthena dvandva mohena Bharata. What creates this confusion? Iccha and Dvesha -- likes and dislikes.\n\nSarvabhutani sammoham sarge yanti parantapa. All beings are deluded from the very moment of birth by likes and dislikes. Right from birth, the little baby knows what is comfortable and what is not. As soon as something is not comfortable -- the diaper is wet -- it starts crying. It has already taken on that conditioning. Per our scriptures, that baby has taken its conditioning --\n\nbecause of past Vasanas, that body is taken. I take this particular state of existence -- that's what I wanted to experience. Why do I go to concerts and not to boxing matches? That's what I want to experience.\n\nThat's why I go to concerts, not wrestling matches. The one who goes to wrestling matches -- tell him to go to the opera! So you have taken on your conditioning based on what you like. Now you divide your world into the world you like and the world you don't like -- the world of your physical existence and the world of your emotions involved with your thinking.",
      "reflection": "\"I am not visible to all, for I am enveloped by the illusion of Yoga-Maya.\" This verse reveals why the spiritual search feels like hide-and-seek. The Divine is not hiding from us; we are veiled from seeing what is already everywhere present. Like someone searching for their glasses while wearing them, we seek what we already are. Today, instead of trying to \"find\" God or truth, try relaxing the very effort to seek. In moments of pure presence, without agenda or grasping, what remains?\n\n\"I know all beings in the past, the present and the future; but they do not know Me.\" From the perspective of space, all rooms are known because space pervades all rooms. But from the perspective of a single room, space seems confined to those four walls. Your consciousness, which seems limited to your body and mind, is actually the same universal consciousness that pervades all beings across all time. Today's exercise: When you meet someone, briefly consider that the awareness looking out from their eyes is the same awareness looking out from yours. Only the conditioning, the \"room,\" is different.\n\nThe root cause of delusion is revealed: \"Iccha-dvesha-samutthena,\" born of likes and dislikes. From the moment of birth, we divide the world into what we want and what we reject. This fundamental duality creates all suffering. Today, notice your automatic reactions of attraction and aversion. The morning coffee you crave, the traffic you despise, the praise you seek, the criticism you avoid. Can you observe these preferences without being completely controlled by them? Even brief moments of equanimity, accepting what is without demanding it be different, give a taste of freedom from the dvandvas (pairs of opposites)."

      ],
      "commentary": "Just to remind us: the Bhagavad Gita is divided into three segments of six chapters each. In the first segment, we learned all about ourselves. The second chapter gave us a summary of who we are.\n\nWhat we remember from the second chapter is that the self is immutable, imperishable. The \"myself\" which I consider \"me\" is immutable, imperishable. But we never fully grasped what that really means. Okay, someone who realizes that -- how would he act? How would he behave in this world? Will he be completely different from us?\n\nWe saw the characteristics of a Gnani, but that didn't show us anything different from what we do. So the next few chapters gave us how to analyze our actions and ourselves, and then recalibrate our actions to become more productive and effective. That first segment ended with Chapter 6 on meditation. Meditation is the means given to us to recalibrate this instrument called mind, body, and intellect.\n\nThen this next segment of six chapters, from 7 to 12, is all about what that imperishable self is which we talked about in Chapter 2. That's why the first chapter of this segment, Chapter 7 -- Gnana Vignana Yoga -- is about having this knowledge of the Lord, that immutable self we learned about in Chapter 2.\n\nBut how can we make it Vishishta Gnana that we can apply? Therefore Chapter 7 describes in detail the Lord's nature and why we can't realize it in our day-to-day life. Bhagavan said, \"I manifest in this world as the Eightfold Prakriti.\" That's something you and I can see -- \"that's nothing but my own manifestation.\" Then he says, \"There is nothing in this world which does not come out of me. Anything you can see, feel, touch, and perceive has come out of me and will dissolve in me.\"\n\nAnd all this world of plurality, as we see it, is strung together. Nothing is independent, like an island in this universe -- which is hinting at us, because we think we are the island of the universe as \"me\" and everything else revolves around me. He said, \"No, everything is strung like pearls in a necklace. I am that common thread. I pervade through this universe as the Eightfold Prakriti.\"\n\nYou are part of that Prakriti. The unmanifest is the common thread among all the manifestations which apparently look different from each other. \"Why then are we not seeing that?\" \"Because you are under the spell of my divine Maya, which creates plurality out of singularity. As long as you are under that spell, you see yourself as different from this world.\" This Maya has three Gunas -- Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas -- and through their permutation and combination, it creates the infinite varieties of things and beings.\n\nBut as long as I can't overcome that Maya, I can't see the truth. In the last set of verses we saw: Iccha dvesha samutthena dvandva mohena Bharata. Because of this desire or that desire, I have divided this world into two -- the world I like and the world I don't like. Right from birth, I'm deluded about myself.\n\nThat immutable, imperishable self talked about in Chapter 2 -- I'm not recognizing it because of the duality my mind has created. My mind says, \"This is me and everything else is the world.\" As long as I can't get out of that concept, Bhagavan said, I won't be able to realize the truth.\n\nHowever, in the last three verses he says that those Gnanis who have erased this wrong notion of who they are -- their papas are all erased by this new line of thinking. Yesham tu antagatam papam jananam punya karmanam.\n\nSo there is hope. Bhagavan said this is not just a philosophical discussion. He's not just telling us, \"You will never realize it.\" No, let's figure out what the problem was in the beginning. The problem was my wrong line of thinking: that I am different from this world. This notion that I am this limited being, and therefore I have all these problems.\n\nOnce I undo the thinking that I am this limited being, the limitation will be gone. Yesham tu antagatam papam -- those whose papas have come to an end. The classic definition of Papa is: a thought or impression which takes me away from myself, takes me away from my understanding that I am that immutable, imperishable self, and creates division between \"I\" and the world. As long as I am driven by the desires of the flesh, my thinking will be focused on how to fulfill those desires.\n\nWhen I start thinking in the same line, it creates deep channels in my mind which guide subsequent thoughts into the same channel. This habit of following the same line of thinking to fulfill desires creates Papa -- because I just can't get out of the thinking that \"this will make me happy.\" Last time I had a cup of coffee and it made me happy. This time it should do the same thing, and I continue. Bhagavan said, that creates your own notion of who you are.\n\nHow do I come out of it? He said, more and more I become introverted through the technique given in the previous chapter -- the meditation that \"No, this is not me. The one who is getting happy with the Starbucks coffee is not me; it is someone other than myself.\" That line of thinking erases those channels created by my attempt to satisfy all the desires that body, mind, and intellect have created. The more I fulfill desires, the more new experiences create new channels of thinking, which create new Vasanas.\n\nThese Vasanas, the tendencies, create the same line of thinking and the same line of actions. I need to stop doing actions driven by the same line of thinking that is not giving me happiness. Even though I figured out last time that investing in the stock market was not good -- because everybody says, \"Don't miss this cycle,\" I'm back again. You need to get out of that line of thinking.\n\nOnce you start meditating on what really makes you happy -- if I analyze my experience, was it the experience that made me happy, or something else? -- you come to the conclusion that no desire makes me happy. When I'm completely at ease, when I don't want anything -- I've already eaten my lunch, I don't have anywhere to go, and I can just sit down -- at least I still have a desire to watch TV, but even if I drop that, I'll probably be completely happy.\n\nThis new line of thinking creates the undoing of all those wrong channels in my mind. Now I have removed all the Papas. Papas are just the wrong line of thinking, the wrong Vasanas.\n\nYesham tu antagatam papam jananam punya karmanam. The method we learned in the first six chapters is Karma Yoga -- selfless actions. When I act in a manner that erases the thinking that \"working to fulfill my desires makes me happy,\" I also realize the real happiness comes when I do something for others -- the true happiness we get when we do something for our children, our parents, our relatives, our friends.\n\nJananam punya karmanam -- they have changed their line of actions, therefore changed their line of thinking, therefore changed their tendencies. Now they are in a completely different realm of actions and thinking. Their Papas are all erased.\n\nTe dvandva moha nirmuktah -- now they are out of this duality. \"I'm not just working for me; I'm working for the whole of humanity, my town, my family.\" I keep expanding my identity until there is no duality between \"I\" and the world. Te dvandva moha nirmuktah -- this Dvandva is nothing but a delusion that you and I are different from each other.\n\nThat this world and I are two different entities is nothing but a delusion. Those who, by acting in the right manner, erase those lines of thinking which create delusion -- now Bhajante mam dridha vratah. Worshipping, we have seen, is an act of love. That love for the divine becomes so firm that I am firmly established in the thought that \"I\" and the world are nothing but part of the same all-pervading entity.\n\nThe next verse says Jara marana mokshaya -- and why am I doing all of this? Because the two things I'm afraid of in life are Jara (old age) and Marana (death). We had a Valentine's Day party yesterday, and you know what the topic was -- because we were all probably above 50 there.\n\n\"How do we get out of this problem of dying? The 10 tubes going through you...\" Because we are afraid of Jara, old age -- when I will not be in control. I was reading about Ronald Reagan, when he was taking a walk and people said, \"Good morning, Mr. President.\" He wouldn't recognize why people were calling him president. He didn't know he was a president. He just thought, \"This guy is nice; he's greeting me.\"\n\nThat's all he could think. The thought that a person can reach that level, where he can't even recognize who he is -- it's pretty scary for all of us. Because all our life we took pride in being in control. I take care of myself. I take care of my family. I take care of my business.\n\n\"I take care of...\" -- \"I am in charge\" is what makes me who I am. The very thought that I will not be in control is very, very disturbing. We want to get out of that. I want to exist, and death wipes me out. It just doesn't seem right.\n\nJara Marana Mokshaya -- for liberation from this thought of old age and death. Mam ashritya -- taking complete refuge in me means not Lord Krishna or Rama or Jesus, but in that immutable self. Taking complete refuge in identification with my immutable self. Just as I'm in complete control in a barber's chair -- the hair I let go and the hair I keep, I'm in complete control. The hair I let go, I don't get attached to.\n\n\"Please, please pack it up for me!\" No -- I say, \"Wipe it out clean as quickly as possible.\"",
      "reflection": "\"Those who act righteously, in whom sin has been destroyed, who are free from the infatuation of conflicting emotions, they worship Me with firm resolution.\" Sin (papa) here is defined not as breaking commandments but as any thought or action that reinforces the illusion of separation between self and the Divine. Each time you act from ego, from the belief that you are a separate, isolated being fighting against the world, you deepen those grooves of wrong thinking. Each time you act from dharma, recognizing your connection to the whole, those grooves begin to fill in. Today, before each significant action, ask: \"Does this reinforce my sense of separation, or does it align me with something greater?\"\n\nThe chapter concludes with the profound motivation for spiritual seeking: \"liberation from decay and death\" (jara-marana-mokshaya). This is not morbid but urgently practical. We all fear aging and death because our identity is bound to the body. The one who knows the Self as distinct from the body has nothing to fear, like someone in a barber's chair watching hair fall away without grief. Today, contemplate: What in you is actually subject to decay? Your body certainly. Your opinions and preferences, yes. Your memories and personality, these too change. But the awareness that witnesses all these changes, has that ever aged?\n\nThe final verses point to the culmination: knowing the Divine in all aspects of existence, as Adhibhuta (in all beings), Adhidaiva (as the cosmic principle), and Adhiyajna (as the sacred offering in every action). The promise is extraordinary: \"Those who know Me thus, even at the hour of death, remain united with Me.\" Today, practice the recognition that every action, however mundane, can be a sacred offering. Washing dishes, answering emails, driving to work, when done with awareness of the Divine presence pervading all, these become Yajna, sacrifice, paths to liberation."

      "commentary": "We have completed discussion on Chapter 7, Gnana Vigana Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge and Wisdom. And we'll be entering into the discussion of Akshara Brahma Yoga, Yoga of Imperishable Brahman. So starting from chapter one, we have seen our own situation, the condition we are in. We are fighting this battle of life, but we get confused about what is right action -- whether this is right or that is right, should I do this or should I do that?\n\nConstantly I'm waffling between this or that and can't come to the right conclusion. So in chapter one, Arjuna kept arguing intellectually, but could not come to any conclusion. In chapter two, in the beginning he surrenders himself to Lord Krishna. Then comes the guidance. So the guidance comes as the revelation about the true nature of our self. So in chapter two, we learned that all that which I have thought about myself was erroneous.\n\nMyself is immortal being. And therefore once I realign my understanding about who I am, everything else will fall in place in a very new pattern. Just like when we are traveling and encounter a new road pattern, we have to adjust to it. Unless you pay attention, you go back to the old way, and if you keep traveling the old road, you are going to run into some construction. So if I change the old way of thinking about who I am to the new way of thinking about who I am, then how I act will change completely. In chapter three, we learned the nature of actions, what actions are all about.\n\nActions are binding, but not the ones which are performed in the spirit of Yajna. So the escape hatch is that all my actions should be performed in the spirit of Yajna for the greater good, for the common good, which is Karma Yoga. So we learned that Karma Yoga is the way to act in this world. And then what is Karma Yoga was defined? If you give up the anxiety for the fruits of actions, that's Karma Yoga. So now my goal is: I have to act in this world, but I want to renounce actions.\n\nSo chapter four talked about how to renounce actions in knowledge. Knowing that I'm not the doer, I'll be able to renounce my actions. That renunciation of the sense of agency is sannyasa. In chapter five, we learned what Sannyasa is. Renouncing the anxiety of actions is Karma Yoga. Performing Karma Yoga, I become a Yogi -- I become so efficient in my actions that I realize I am not the doer at all.\n\nAnd that is sannyasa. Once I renounce this sense of agency, then I have to identify with my true self. So in chapter six we learn the techniques of meditation -- how to give up the identity with the limited self, the conditioned self which I currently consider to be me, and how to align with the true self that we learned about in chapter two. That alignment is chapter six: the techniques of meditation on the self.\n\nBut now, how to meditate on the self? What is the subject of my meditation? We learnt that in chapter seven. There we learned that the nature of the true supreme self is twofold. One is Lower Prakriti and one is higher Prakriti. The lower is the one which I can experience, perceive, feel, touch and cognize and say this is it.\n\nSo the reality which I can perceive through my senses is the manifest world. The Bhagavan says that's my Lower Prakriti. Everything that you see, touch, feel is made up of my own self. The Asthatha Prakriti. That's his Eightfold which is Bhumi, Apaha, Kham, Analah, Vayuhu, Mana, Buddhi and Ahankar. All five great elements.\n\nMind, intellect and Ahankal, Ego. So there is nothing left. You take any entity in this world, and it will fall somewhere in this combination of eight -- start recognizing my Saguna Prakriti. This Prakriti has names and forms. But he says there is a higher Prakriti which is beyond this Saguna Prakriti -- the Nirguna Prakriti, which has no names, no forms, no colors, no attributes, no entity, no being.\n\nHe said that's my Higher Prakriti. That Prakriti is what I'm now trying to align myself with in my meditation, because I can already identify with the Saguna Prakriti. So we started our journey from \"me\" -- being the most selfish person, only thinking about \"this is me.\" Then we expand our horizon and say, I'm a little better than that; I identify with my family.\n\nI expand my horizon even more and say, no, no -- my community is also me, not just my family. Then I expand a little further and say, no, no, my nation is also me. Then I go even further -- Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam -- this planet is my home.\n\nAnd then I say I'm going to go beyond that. And this cosmos is me. This gradually expanding my identification from this limited me to cosmic me. From a Saguna perspective is which I can do with my open eyes meditation. But then I have to go to the higher Prakriti that is beyond all the names and forms. Bhagawan says that's my imperishable nature.\n\nThat's Akshara Brahma. So chapter eight now attempts to explain what that higher nature is. In the last chapter, in the ending two verses, Bhagavan said that one who knows myself in its totality -- Adhibutam, Adhi Daivam and Adhiyagnam -- even at the time of death, even that becomes a glimpse. At the last minute this complete picture becomes clear to me: what is Saguna Prakriti?\n\nWhat is Nirguna Prakriti? And what is this creation is all about? So now Arjuna obviously wants to know all the technical terms he heard in last chapter. So the chapter eight start with Arjuna's question. And as we have seen, he asked Bhagavan to define seven terms he has heard in his discourse. What is that Brahman which you are talking about?\n\nThen what is Adhyatma Kim? We talked about actions we know. Without action I cannot even survive. I cannot maintain my body. Then what is Adhibhuta? You talked about Adhibhuta in the last chapter. Kim Proktam Adhi Daivam -- and what is called Adhidaivam? What is it that we call Adhi Daivam? Adi Yagna Katham Ko ata Katham -- what is Yajna and how does it work?\n\nAdi Yajna is Dehe asmin Madhusudhana. We have discussed Madhu Sudhana, the slayer of Madhu. Madhu was a demon in our life -- that which feels very good is my enemy. I learned that in old age, the only taste that survives is sweet. I was talking to one of our friends who said, \"I don't know why, but I never liked sweets in my life.\"\n\n\"And now in my old age I like nothing but sweets.\" Isn't it very simple? All your taste buds die as you grow older. The only ones that survive are the sweet taste buds. So the only thing I really taste is sweetness. Everything else is not very enchanting anymore.\n\nThe slayer of Madhu is Madhu Sudhana. O Madhu Sudhana, Prayana kale cha Katham Gneyo asi Niyatatma Bihi -- in the last verse of the last chapter, he said that even at the last moment, if you know this, know myself as Adhi Bhuta, Adhi Deva, Adi Yajna. How do I know even at the last minute? You tell me, how should I know? And how do I make sure that I will know? How do I live a self-controlled life? Niyatatma Bhi -- self-control so that I will know you at the last minute. He recognized that at least there is some exercise I have to do.\n\nNot just relying on luck or chance that I will remember him at the last minute just because I named my son after him. In fact, he may distract me -- because \"Rama, Rama, O Rama\" went away from here to Austin, Texas. I'm glad that I have only one son, and his name is not after any Devta. Niraj! So Arjuna says, just let me know. All other six questions were relatively less important. What he really wanted to know about was the last minute -- that was the real question. How do I live a self-controlled life so that even at the last minute I will know your real self? And why is the last minute so important here? That's a milestone. When I decide that I'm going to take a vacation, that's a change -- from here I'm going there. Till that time, it doesn't matter; I'm here. Mawlik moving from here to Dallas, Texas.\n\nThe day he moves is a milestone. Till that, he is just Mawlik. So Prayana Kale Apicha -- because I know that I will have the transition from this self to that existence, how do I make sure that I go to the right place, to know you? The answer comes in the next two verses, which actually, if we wanted to discuss fully, could take six months. We'll do it in the next 10 minutes.\n\nAksharam Brahma Paramam. Very simple. Brahman is Akshara -- that which is imperishable is Brahman. Everything that I know in this world is perishable. Brahman is imperishable. That means anything which I can assign a beginning and end is not Brahman. Aksha Ra, that Akshay.\n\nThat which makes \"I\" revel in that form is Akshara. That's why the letters are called Akshara -- because they become real to us. So Saguna, from that perspective, is Akshara. But Paramam -- Aksaram Brahma Paramam -- that which is higher than Akshara is Brahman. So from that definition, that which is greater than Saguna, different than Saguna is Brahman.\n\nSo now I have to negate everything that I know and go beyond my knowledge. Therefore it is transcendental -- it cannot be learned through intellect, cannot be experienced through my mind. It is transcendental. Svabhava Adhyatma Uchyate.\n\nThey ask, what is Adhyatma? It is Svabhava -- the nature of your own self. That which makes me who I am is my Svabhava. Bhagavan Sankaracharya says that that which makes me who I am is Paramatma. When he resides in me, he is Pratyagatma.\n\nAnd when that Pratyagatma identifies with this body, mind, and intellect, it becomes the Jiva. It is something between the Jivatma as I know myself and the all-pervading Paramatma. The part of him which is me is Pratyagatma. That is my svabhava; without that I cannot do anything. Therefore he says, when I know my own self, that is Adhyatma. Bhuta Bhava Udbhavakara Visargaha Karma Sanginitam -- Swamiji says this is a very revolutionary definition of Karma.\n\nFrom that perspective, Karma was always considered a ritualistic performance. When you perform any rituals, they were considered Karma. From our Vedic literature, Bhagavana defines Karma as Bhuta Bhava Udbhavakara. That which brings forth beings and things into existence is Karma. So any creative endeavor is Karma. When I create something, it is Karma.\n\nWhen I improve something, it's karma. So Swamiji says that anything else you do is just labor. Therefore nobody congratulates me in the morning when I brush my teeth -- unless you are a two or three year old child. Because it's not karma unless I assign value to it and say I am doing it for the betterment of my teeth. Then it's karma -- Bhuta Bhava Kara.\n\nThat which creates improvement and brings things and beings into existence is Karma. So Bhagavan's Karma is that he creates this universe out of his self as Ishvara. He takes the help of his Maya, becomes Ishwara, becomes Hiranyagarbha, and creates this universe. From our perspective, anything we do to create something, improve something, improve myself, improve the lives of others -- that is Karma. That which brings everything down is Papa, not Karma.",
      "reflection": "Arjuna's seven questions in these verses reveal a fundamental human longing: to understand the ultimate nature of reality and our place within it. Before we can embark on any meaningful spiritual journey, we must first ask the right questions. Take time today to examine your own burning questions about existence. What is it that you truly want to know?\n\nKrishna defines Karma here not as mere ritual, but as \"Bhuta Bhava Udbhavakara\"—that which creates improvement and brings beings into existence. This revolutionary definition transforms how we view our daily activities. Ask yourself: Are my actions today merely labor, or are they true Karma—creative endeavors that contribute to the betterment of myself and others?\n\nThe teaching that Brahman is \"Akshara\" (imperishable) while everything we can perceive is perishable invites deep contemplation. Consider making a list of what you cling to most tightly—possessions, relationships, achievements, identity. Recognize that all these fall within the realm of the perishable Lower Prakriti. This is not meant to create despair, but clarity. The practice is to hold these things lightly while turning your attention toward that which cannot be destroyed. In meditation today, try to shift your identification from the Saguna (with attributes) to the Nirguna (without attributes)—from the room space of your conditioned self to the infinite space of pure awareness. What would it feel like to expand your identification beyond \"me\" to family, community, nation, planet, and ultimately, the cosmos itself?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 8, Akshara Brahma Yoga, Yoga of Imperishable Brahman. The last chapter ended with Bhagavan's statement that one who knows me, even at the time of death, Pryanakala, with reference to the Adi Bhuta, Adi Deva and Adi Yajna in totality will come to me. That was a statement. So Arjuna starts the chapter with question about defining these terms. Adhibhuta, Adhi Deva and Adiyajna. What are those terms?\n\nWhat do they indicate? But he added three more terms, Brahma, Karma and Adyat also to be defined. So what we have seen in the first four verses are the definitions of these terms. And we come to the last question, how the one with the steadfast mind at the end should come to know you. So what we have seen so far is the definition of Purusha and Prakriti -- that which is time-bound and that which is timeless. The self as you consider it right now is time-bound.\n\nTherefore there is a death. Death is a milestone in your existence. So as we have discussed last time, that these verses in the entire chapter only make sense if you take the concept of reincarnation in its essence as valid principle. But that's also not really the case because it is about the existence. That which you are talking about, the existence which I consider right now is limited existence. Will there be any existence after I die?\n\nThat's a burning question in everyone's mind. Knowingly or unknowingly, consciously or unconsciously, we ask this question -- whether you believe in reincarnation or not. No culture, no religion has ever questioned existence itself. Every religion talks about existence after death. We have difficulty accepting the idea of reincarnation because we live in a culture bound by science and technology. Unless you are one of those who do not believe in evolution and climate change, we all seek approval from science and technology.\n\nTherefore I don't question whether my cell phone working is the magic. We know it is supported by science and technology. Reincarnation is currently not proven from our scientific perspective. So even when this topic came up last time, Ram had to bring university research to convince some of us that this also can be researched. But what here is indicated is the existence. That we will exist is not a question in anybody's mind.\n\nTherefore, the incentive for terrorists to become a bomber is what? What would you do with virgins after you die? You believe you won't be existing, yet you believe you will exist and will have time to enjoy. So the existence is never questioned anywhere. In any religion, in any culture, in any thought, in any philosophy, existence is considered permanent. There was an existence before my birth and there will be existence after my birth.\n\nBut what is now important is what kind of existence I would have. So our culture has put great emphasis on planning for long-term existence. What about short-term planning? Companies who plan for the long term make progress. Like Warren Buffett does his investment in a long term basis. Some people do investment on quarter to quarter basis.\n\nSo what we do in our life is short-term planning. We plan to have a better life in this life. One life to live is the philosophy, right? There is only one life to live. Oh, Sastra said, no, not true. You have infinite lives to live.\n\nYou have innumerable lives to live. And therefore plan wisely so that your future existence would be happier. So these verses now try to define how to plan for a long term existence versus short term existence. See, the first thing we learn is Adi Bhuta is perishable. That which I see has been created. Therefore the term Karma is defined.\n\nBhuta Bhava udbhavakara idhi Karma. That which creates Bhuta Bhava -- a being or a thing -- is karma. So anything which is created will be perishable. Anything which comes into existence is perishable. So when I'm planning within the realm of objects, it is temporary. So if I want to really plan for a real long term, I want to plan beyond the realm of perishable things and beings.\n\nThat is what they call it. You will come to me, Me, the supreme Me, the imperishable. Because there are two existence which we have known through our discussion. One is imperishable, never perishes, never changes, never have any mutation. And the one which is constantly changing. I clearly identify with the one with changes.\n\nBecause I identify with this, the body, this mind, this intellect. I clearly know that this body is perishable. I have learned through my experiences in life, this body is perishable. And also I have observed from My inferred knowledge that people die and people bury them or burn them, cremate them, so my body will go through the same fate. So we have come to the clear understanding that this body is perishable. What we have not yet understood is the mind and intellect.\n\nA lot of this research which we hear is all about brain, not the mind. Talking to psychiatrists, they say we don't understand mind. We don't know how these medications work. We just know that it works and therefore it is good enough to prescribe. But what mind is is very much a mystery. So it is possible that our ancestors did not know much about the physical senses, but they knew a little more about mind than what we know today.\n\nSo they have come to the conclusion that this mind and intellect has a life of its own, beyond this body's life. So Prayana Kale Api -- at the time of the journey, that mind and intellect, remaining intact, is going to make a move. Bhagavan Veda Vyasa here basically reaffirms the basic principles of Hinduism or Vedantic philosophy: this body is the only thing that dies at the time of death. The jiva, the one identified with this limited mind and intellect, remains intact and seeks another state of existence to exhaust the remaining vasanas.\n\nSo Bhagavan in verse 5 gives the same answer which he gave as a statement at the end of chapter 7.\n\nAntakale Chamameva Smaranam uktvakalevaram yaha prayati samad bhavam yati na asti atra sansayaha. Only thing he does is he gives a guarantee. Last time he made a statement, this time he gives a guarantee. I'm selling somebody something, but I don't have means to support all my claims about my product. I guarantee you that if it doesn't work, you can return it to me. I'll return all the money.\n\nSo guarantee is one way of making the student or the buyer feel more comfortable. He already said, one who knows me in totality will come to me. So he said, even at the last moment, because we have considered this life to be the only life for me to make any progress. And if I think I wasted most of my life, what am I going to do now? This is more like my music teacher made a statement to me when I went to him when I was in my 40s. Subhas, do you know that I'm 47?\n\nHe said, \"So what? You're not 67 yet.\" So now if I go to him, he will say, \"Subhas, I'm 67.\" And there's still time. Even at the time of your death, if you come to realize what is truth, thou shall achieve truth. That's the guarantee. Bhagawan says Antakaale chamame vas maran muktvakale varan.\n\nOne who leaves this body at the time of death Antakaala. At the end of this body, he leaves this body. So something is leaving. Somebody is making a journey. That means the one who is identified with the ego has not died yet. That ego is making its own journey now.\n\nFrom this body to somewhere else. From this existence to some other existence. Existence is not questioned. It is the state of existence which is questioned here. Whether will I remain in the same state of existence that I am? Will I retain my wisdom or will I retain my stupidity is the question.\n\nOne who even at the last minute recognizes the truth. He will come to know me. He will come to become one with me. There is no question about it. So he guarantees that you have plenty of time till you die to churn over this idea of what is truth. Even the last moment, if you have eureka moment that oh that's what it is.\n\nBhagawan says that's good enough. Will come to recognize me and realize me. But you still have to make a supportive argument, because we are not born into guarantees. That's why we go on social networks and say, \"What are the comments other people have made?\" You know, Meena and I always struggle about exercise.\n\nSo Meena came across something called a seat and cycle. As usual, I said don't worry about it. But once we ordered, we realized there are five more payments to be made. It was never revealed on that Facebook page -- see, there are five more payments! I said, if you want to go ahead, go.\n\nBut by the time she had already pressed that button. So then she started reading all the opinions and the comments. They're all pretty bad. This is not a product for elderly. You can fall down also. It took me three times it broke down.\n\nWe said cancel that order as quickly as you can. Because they didn't guarantee anything. They only offered a free trial for 30 days. Bhagwan gave the guarantee. But realize that you will be looking for some support, watching some comments from other users. So he makes his supporting argument.\n\nYam yam vapi smaran Bhavam tyajatyante kalevaram tamtam eva Ithi kaunteya sada tad bhava bhavitaha. A statement of fact: whosoever you are thinking of at the time of leaving your body, that and that person alone you shall go to. Looking at our own context of life -- who do we meet in life? The people whom we think about most. We constantly think about a person. Then we obviously make a plan to meet. When my mother was alive, I was thinking about her the most. Every two years I was making a plan to go and see her.\n\nNow I really have not. Even though I have my brothers and my nephews and nieces, it's not that much of a pressure on me to go to India anymore. Because I was thinking about my mother all the time. I was feeling guilty that I have left my mother at the age of 17 or 18. Never went home, never took care of her. So constantly was thinking about her.\n\nAnd therefore my plans will be no other vacation. Go to India, stay with her for a few days. So Bhagavan said that it is a given: whatever is my constant thought becomes the last thought at the time of my journey. Where will you go for vacation? Not to a place you have never thought about. The vacation you are planning for the last six months -- you have checked all the brochures, checked out all the prices, checked out all the hotel accommodations available, researched all the places to visit. Then, at the time of your journey to take a vacation --\n\nThat's the ticket you buy and that's the place you end up going. Bhagavan says, one who is constantly thinking about me is the only one who will be thinking about me at the time of death to come to me. Therefore the next verse says, tasmat sarveshu kaleshu -- therefore at all times, mam anusmara, think about me. And then he says, Yudhyacha Swamiji says that this half sloka, if misunderstood, can bring down the entire generation.",
      "reflection": "Krishna's guarantee in verse 5 is remarkable: \"Whosoever at the time of death thinks only of Me... assuredly he will know Me.\" This is not about luck at the final moment, but about the power of lifelong habits of thought. The teaching \"Yam yam vapi smaran bhavam\" reveals a profound psychological truth—we become what we consistently think about. Examine your mental habits today: Where does your mind naturally drift when it is unoccupied? What do you think about first thing in the morning and last thing at night? These habitual thought patterns are shaping your inner trajectory. Just as you naturally plan vacations to places you have been researching for months, your consciousness will move toward whatever you have been contemplating most deeply.\n\nThe verse distinguishes between Adhibhuta (the perishable realm of matter) and the imperishable Self that Krishna represents. This is an invitation to shift your planning horizon. Most of our planning is short-term—this life, this career, this relationship. But these verses invite us to consider: What if you planned for your long-term existence across many lives? This week, practice the \"mother meditation\"—think of someone you love deeply, as the teacher spoke of thinking constantly about his mother. Notice how that consistent thought naturally creates action (visiting, caring, connecting). Now apply this same principle to your spiritual aspiration. What would it mean to think about the Supreme Self with that same consistency and devotion? Begin simply: set three reminders on your phone each day to pause and remember your true imperishable nature."

This is more like my music teacher made a statement to me when I went to him when I was in my 40s. Subhas, do you know that I'm 47?\n\nHe said, \"So what? You're not 67 yet.\" So now if I go to him, he will say, \"Subhas, I'm 67.\" And there's still time. Even at the time of your death, if you come to realize what is truth, thou shall achieve truth. That's the guarantee. Bhagawan says Antakaale chamame vas maran muktvakale varan.\n\nOne who leaves this body at the time of death Antakaala. At the end of this body, he leaves this body. So something is leaving. Somebody is making a journey. That means the one who is identified with the ego has not died yet. That ego is making its own journey now.\n\nFrom this body to somewhere else. From this existence to some other existence. Existence is not questioned. It is the state of existence which is questioned here. Whether will I remain in the same state of existence that I am? Will I retain my wisdom or will I retain my stupidity is the question.\n\nOne who even at the last minute recognizes the truth. He will come to know me. He will come to become one with me. There is no question about it. So he guarantees that you have plenty of time till you die to churn over this idea of what is truth. Even the last moment, if you have eureka moment that oh that's what it is.\n\nBhagawan says that's good enough. Will come to recognize me and realize me. But you still have to make a supportive argument, because we are not born into guarantees. That's why we go on social networks and say, \"What are the comments other people have made?\" You know, Meena and I always struggle about exercise.\n\nSo Meena came across something called a seat and cycle. As usual, I said don't worry about it. But once we ordered, we realized there are five more payments to be made. It was never revealed on that Facebook page -- see, there are five more payments! I said, if you want to go ahead, go.\n\nBut by the time she had already pressed that button. So then she started reading all the opinions and the comments. They're all pretty bad. This is not a product for elderly. You can fall down also. It took me three times it broke down.\n\nWe said cancel that order as quickly as you can. Because they didn't guarantee anything. They only offered a free trial for 30 days. Bhagwan gave the guarantee. But realize that you will be looking for some support, watching some comments from other users. So he makes his supporting argument.\n\nYam yam vapi smaran Bhavam tyajatyante kalevaram tamtam eva Ithi kaunteya sada tad bhava bhavitaha. A statement of fact: whosoever you are thinking of at the time of leaving your body, that and that person alone you shall go to. Looking at our own context of life -- who do we meet in life? The people whom we think about most. We constantly think about a person. Then we obviously make a plan to meet. When my mother was alive, I was thinking about her the most. Every two years I was making a plan to go and see her.\n\nNow I really have not. Even though I have my brothers and my nephews and nieces, it's not that much of a pressure on me to go to India anymore. Because I was thinking about my mother all the time. I was feeling guilty that I have left my mother at the age of 17 or 18. Never went home, never took care of her. So constantly was thinking about her.\n\nAnd therefore my plans will be no other vacation. Go to India, stay with her for a few days. So Bhagavan said that it is a given: whatever is my constant thought becomes the last thought at the time of my journey. Where will you go for vacation? Not to a place you have never thought about. The vacation you are planning for the last six months -- you have checked all the brochures, checked out all the prices, checked out all the hotel accommodations available, researched all the places to visit. Then, at the time of your journey to take a vacation --\n\nThat's the ticket you buy and that's the place you end up going. Bhagavan says, one who is constantly thinking about me is the only one who will be thinking about me at the time of death to come to me. Therefore the next verse says, tasmat sarveshu kaleshu -- therefore at all times, mam anusmara, think about me. And then he says, Yudhyacha Swamiji says that this half sloka, if misunderstood, can bring down the entire generation.",
      "reflection": "\"Tasmat sarveshu kaleshu mam anusmara yudhya cha\"—\"Therefore meditate always on Me, and fight.\" Swamiji warns that this half-verse, if misunderstood, can bring down an entire generation. The key insight is that Krishna is not asking us to abandon our duties to sit in constant prayer. Rather, He asks us to fight the battle of life while maintaining remembrance of our true nature. This is the integration of action and awareness. Today, experiment with this teaching: Choose one routine activity—washing dishes, commuting, exercising—and practice holding a background awareness of your deeper Self while fully engaging in the task. Notice how this dual awareness affects both the quality of your work and your inner state.\n\nVerse 9 offers a powerful word-picture for meditation on the Supreme: \"Kavim Puranam Anusasitaram\"—the Omniscient, the Ancient, the Ruler of all; \"Anor aniyamsam\"—subtler than the subtlest atom; \"Aditya varnam tamasa parastat\"—brilliant like the sun, beyond all darkness. This is not a form to visualize, but qualities to contemplate. The Supreme is self-effulgent—it does not need anything else to reveal itself, just as your own awareness needs nothing external to be known to you. In your meditation this week, rather than trying to picture a form, rest in the quality of awareness itself. Notice that you are aware. That awareness is self-revealing. Can you find where that awareness ends? Can you locate its boundaries? This pathless investigation is the meditation Krishna recommends for those who would attain \"the Supreme Purusha, the Resplendent One.\""

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter eight, Akshara Brahma Yoga, Yoga of Imperishable Brahman. And as we have seen so far, the first four verses gave us the nature of the Brahman, the immanence and transcendence of Brahman, that everything they can think about, Shara and Akshara is all Brahman. It's all his manifestation. And then in the next few verses we have seen that how at the time of death, death of the state of existence, death of this thought, death of ego, how one can recognize that permanence of the self. And last few verses, Bhagawan had been giving us the word picture of that imperishable Brahman. So we have seen the Kavim Puranam Anusasitharam that he is omniscient, he is ancient and he is having the lordship over everything.\n\nBut that picture also doesn't give us the complete picture. He is minuter than minute. It is not something we can paint a picture in our head or formulate a form in our head. So anything we can formulate a form is not him. It is beyond capacity of our intellect. And Sarvasya Dhaataram Achinte Rupam.\n\nHe is a supporter of all and it cannot be thought of. Aditya Varanam tama Sahaprasthat. He is self effulgent. It does not require any other means to know him. By its very nature he reveals himself. Awareness itself is him.\n\nI need to be aware of an object. For an object to be known, I have to be aware of it. So my awareness is necessary to make that object revealed to myself. But my awareness itself does not require anything to be known to me. Awareness itself makes itself available. So the next few verses talked about the Pryanakala.\n\nWe have seen the difference between Antakaala and Pryanakala. Priyanakala is the time of departure. I may be coming back. My departure may be for going now and coming back again. Antikala is the last end of it. I'm not going anywhere.\n\nOnce I go there, I'm not coming back. So the one who at the time of departure focus on the nature of the self, he will also achieve that realization of the impermanence. So the whole goal we have seen so far is gaining the experience of something which we have not experienced before. We have been striving all our life -- knowingly or unknowingly.\n\nWe have been trying to find a state of existence where there is no sorrow, no imperfection, no unhappiness. That state we're constantly struggling to achieve by all the means available to us through our equipment of body, mind, and intellect. We try and employ all three of them to achieve the state of perfection -- where there is no unhappiness, no sorrow, no disease.\n\nAnd as Bhagavan Buddha found out, there is nothing like that in this world. So there got to be a place or state because otherwise we won't be striving for it. If health is not my nature, I won't be striving for health. I'll be very happy, be unhealthy. But that's not my natural state of my existence. Therefore as soon as something happens, I run to the doctor, fix it.\n\nSo unhappiness also cannot be a natural thing to me. However, I'm constantly unhappy. So what should I be doing to achieve that? What we have seen last is Yat Aksaram Veda Vido Vadanti -- that imperishable state which the knowers of the Vedas talk about. There is a state where all that you are seeking is available.\n\nVishyanti Yat Yoho Vit Ragaha. People give up everything in life to achieve that state. Brahmacharyam Charanti. By desiring that people practice Brahmacharya. Last time as we have seen Brahma Acharya Brahmachari. One who is reveling or pursuing the path of Brahman is Brahmachari.\n\nOne who is following the path of action is a Karmachari. In Hindi, as we have discussed last time, the clerks are called Karmacharis. But you know, one who is their boss is called Adyaksha. One who keeps eye on them is Adyaksha. So we are Karmachari in all our day to day life. Because we constantly see what is next.\n\nI have done this, I've been there. Somebody says, \"Take a cruise\" -- I have done it. Tell me something else which I can do. Because we are constantly asking, what is next, what will be our next action? Brahmacharya is constantly seeking how to become one with Brahman -- that is a Brahmachari. And who is the Adyaksha?\n\nIn this case, our consciousness is keeping an eye on what's happening. Tatte padam sangrahena pravakshye -- I'm going to tell you about that state of existence which you have been seeking all your life, which you have tried everything to achieve so far but have not attained. I'm going to tell you in a summary.\n\nNow Bhagavan explains how that state can be achieved. So the next verse says sarvadvarani samyamya mano ruddin irudhyyacha murdni adhay atmanah pranam astito yogadharana. This is obviously explaining the technique of meditation. We want to experience that state. I cannot be experiencing in our day to day life, but at least I can have a glimpse in my meditation. In meditation what I get is a glimpse of that state where there is no unhappiness, there is no sorrow.\n\nBut that cannot be just 20 minutes a day or 30 minutes a day, once in the morning and once in the evening. It has to be a continuous state of existence. I am not seeking temporary happiness; I'm seeking permanent happiness. It says Sarva dwarani samyamya. So far, everything that has caused me unhappiness is because of my sense perception. When I see that the temperature outside is not conducive to my liking, because I feel it, then I feel unhappy.\n\nSo senses are telling me whether it's conducive or not. If that information is not available to me, then I will not know. Just as in my deep sleep, I'm not aware what temperature the room is, whether Donald Trump is winning or Hillary Clinton is ahead. None of that exists in my deep sleep. So the first thing we notice is that these senses are causing agitation in my mind. Sarva dwarani samyamya -- let's experience what happens when I close all the gates of information.\n\nYou know, people who take retreats these days -- it's very difficult to take a true retreat. Ten or twenty years ago when we used to take retreats, they would say, you can't take a radio with you, you cannot take anything with you. Don't listen to radio, don't listen to television. But now people take their phone -- and everything, television included, is on your phone. The idea of a retreat was that you are constantly bombarded with information which distracts you, so at least for that week,\n\nYou are cut off from the world outside. What's happening politically, what's happening in a profession, all that you're not listening. So this takes that idea to an extreme and say close all your senses when you sit down in meditation. Sarva dwarani Samyami. Controlling all your gates. Manohrudi Nirudhyacha.\n\nPlacing your mind in your heart. In a sense, placing your mind -- which was running outside in day-to-day life -- inward. The mind's job is to go outside and get information, like the clerk who is gathering all the data from outside and reporting it to the intellect, the adyaksha, to decipher the data. Now, make that mind turn inward.\n\nHriddi means inward -- basically, focus on yourself. Your thoughts should be one and one alone: What is my real self? That's the thought, one single thought. Murdni Adhaya Atmanah -- having your pranas in your head. Now this looks like very high-level yogic exercise.\n\nNow it can be but you can look at it in many different ways. At our level, this is a technique of a meditation when at least for those 20 minutes you're trying to cut off yourself from this world. You cut off yourself from your senses, cut off all your mind from running out and turn inward. Then say Murdni a day atman. Focus all your pranas into your head. Now sit down for meditation.\n\nSee where you feel any life. At that time, all your focus will be on your head. Therefore in the technical meditation chapter six we said focus your mind between your two eyebrows. Because you're not aware of rest of the body, you're dropping all your awareness about the rest of your body. You're focusing only the one thing, one thing alone. Your computer which is functioning at that time in your head.\n\nThey said, placing your pranas -- all the physiological activities happening in your body -- you're only aware of what's happening in your mind, at the head, at that time. Therefore pranayama helps, because first you focus on the breathing. Right now I'm focusing on everything that is happening in my body: my legs are moving, my hands are moving, my lips are moving. When doing meditation you stop thinking about your legs and hands and mouth and you only start thinking about what's happening in your mind. So when you first start focusing only on your breath, you are not focusing on anything else which is going on in your body. That puts you in a state where mind will calm down. And then you can just focus on who I am.\n\nSo only one thought and one thought alone. Pranam astitha Yogadharanam. One who has been practicing this over and over and over again can achieve the state of meditation very easily. And the next verse says Omiti ek aksaram Brahma -- this is truly a technique of meditation we have learned in chapter six. He's putting it again in a very succinct manner for you to understand.\n\nWhat is the goal of meditation? The goal of meditation is to give us a glimpse of that state where there is no limitation, no unhappiness, no sorrow -- just bliss. So once you have now controlled your senses and your mind and your pranas: Omiti ek aksaram Brahma vyaharan mam anusmaran -- chant the one syllable Om, which is the sound symbol of God. God can be pictured in many different ways, but the simplest and most non-distracting form is the word Om. And we have seen before --\n\nThe Om represents the creation, sustenance and destruction or the past, present and future. But that one word contains everything that needs to be known about the self. So Vyaharan Mam Anusmaran -- while uttering that one syllable Om, remember Me. Don't just get focused on the sound alone. I'm thinking about that self which is all-pervading, and the Om is representing it.\n\nFirst you can start chanting out loud, then gradually lower your pitch, and then just chant in your mind -- constantly thinking about that one self and that one self alone, which pervades everywhere -- while chanting Aum. Yah prayati tyajan Deham -- one who leaves this body, you can consider that as your death. That is the time of death. All this which we have learned in these last two verses, we all have known. Looking at people who have died in front of your eyes, it is not possible to meditate at the time of death. You are not there to meditate.\n\nYou have no control over what's happening. So this verse is actually about the death in your meditation -- the death of your identification with your body, mind and intellect. Yaha prayati tyajan Deham. The complete detachment from the identification with this body. In my meditation Sa yati paramam gatima he experiences that supreme state of existence.\n\nIf you perfect your meditation to a point that I can Control all my senses.",
      "reflection": "These verses reveal a practical meditation technique: \"Sarva dvarani samyamya\"—close all the gates of the senses; \"Mano hridi nirudhya\"—draw the mind inward to the heart; \"Murdhni adhaya atmanah pranam\"—focus the vital energy in the head. This is not esoteric instruction reserved for advanced yogis—it describes what happens naturally when we truly withdraw attention from external stimulation. Consider how retreats work: by removing radio, television, and now phones, we close the gates of information that constantly agitate the mind. This week, create a mini-retreat for yourself. Set aside 20 minutes where you consciously close all \"gates\"—no phone, no conversation, no reading. Notice how when external input stops, awareness naturally turns inward and begins to settle in the \"heart\"—the center of your being.\n\nThe teaching about focusing pranas in the head during meditation has a practical interpretation for daily practice. When you sit for meditation, begin by noticing where you feel \"alive\" in your body—this is prana. Through breath awareness, gradually let go of awareness of your limbs, your torso, and gather your sense of aliveness into your head, particularly between your eyebrows. This is not about straining; it is about selective attention. Just as you can choose to feel the sensation in your left thumb right now, you can choose to center your awareness. The goal, as verse 11 states, is to glimpse \"that imperishable state which the knowers of the Vedas speak of\"—a state without limitation, without sorrow, of pure bliss. Your 20-minute meditation becomes a dress rehearsal for the ultimate letting go. What are you practicing? What are you becoming skilled at releasing?"

The goal of meditation is to give us a glimpse of that state where there is no limitation, no unhappiness, no sorrow -- just bliss.

Yah prayati tyajan Deham -- one who leaves this body, you can consider that as your death. That is the time of death. All this which we have learned in these last two verses, we all have known. Looking at people who have died in front of your eyes, it is not possible to meditate at the time of death. You are not there to meditate.\n\nYou have no control over what's happening. So this verse is actually about the death in your meditation -- the death of your identification with your body, mind and intellect. Yaha prayati tyajan Deham. The complete detachment from the identification with this body. In my meditation Sa yati paramam gatima he experiences that supreme state of existence.\n\nIf you perfect your meditation to a point that I can Control all my senses.",
      "reflection": "\"Om iti ekaksharam Brahma\"—Om, the single syllable, is Brahman. This verse introduces the most practical tool for meditation: the sacred syllable Om. Unlike complex visualizations or elaborate rituals, Om is simple, portable, and universally accessible. It represents all of creation, sustenance, and dissolution—past, present, and future—compressed into one sound. This week, practice the progression described: begin chanting Om aloud, then gradually soften it to a whisper, then to a mental repetition, then let even that dissolve into silent awareness. Notice how the sound carries your attention inward naturally. The instruction \"Mam anusmaran\"—\"remembering Me\"—reminds us that Om is not just a sound to repeat mechanically, but a symbol pointing to the all-pervading Self.\n\nVerse 14 offers an extraordinary promise: \"Ananya chetah satatam yo mam smarati nityashah, tasya aham sulabhah\"—\"To one who thinks of Me constantly with undivided mind, I am easy to attain.\" The word \"sulabhah\" (easy to attain) is striking. Usually we think of God-realization as the most difficult achievement. Krishna reverses this: for the devoted practitioner with one-pointed focus, it is natural and easy. The difficulty lies only in our divided attention. Examine your attention today: How many competing loyalties divide your mind? How many contradictory desires pull you in different directions? Verse 15 reveals the ultimate result: those who reach the Supreme \"go no more to the misery and death of earthly life.\" This is not about escaping the world, but about completing the curriculum. Once perfection is gained, there is no need to return to the school of suffering. What would it mean to approach each day as if you were completing your final semester?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 8, Akshara Brahma Yoga Yoga of Imperishable Brahman this world which I live in has things and beings. Things have their production date or date of creation and will also have a date of destruction. Beings have their birth dates and will also have their death dates. Nothing in this world remains permanently. Everything is perishable, exists for a limited period in both time and space. But this ever changing reality which I experience as the world cannot exist unless there is an imperishable substratum.\n\nAnd Bhagavan said in this chapter that Brahman is that imperishable reality. Brahman is the truth which makes all other relative truths possible. For example, I can say this room exists. That's a statement of truth. But it only exists because the another universal truth exists. That is the room space existed before this room was built.\n\nIt is right now here as room space and will remain space when this room will be destroyed. So based on that universal reality which I call space, the relative reality, what I call room space can exist. Bhagavan says the Brahman in a similar way exists. As Bhagawan Shankaracharya says, the principle that graces all bodies is their essential self. Any being will not be aware of his own self unless that principle, imperishable immortal principle is residing in that body. With that consciousness I become aware of my conditioning which I call my body, mind and intellect.\n\nAnd then I'm aware of myself. So it is the self-knowing reality -- the very nature of Brahman -- which makes me aware of myself as that conditioned self. Right now I'm not aware of my supreme self that is imperishable, deathless, and birthless. But I'm aware of myself as this limited body, limited mind, limited intellect -- as Nil Bhatt -- because of that consciousness which is functioning through me.\n\nSo Bhagavan says that that consciousness is now making you aware of your own limitations and also making you aware of the existence of this world of perishable nature. As long as I am conditioned and identified with this body, mind, and intellect, I will have all the limitations of this body, mind, and intellect.\n\nAnd therefore the sorrows, therefore unhappiness. And therefore I feel bound by these limitations. My goal is to liberate myself from my limitations, my unhappiness, my sorrows and attain a state of bliss where there never will be any sorrow, never will be any limitations and never will be any unhappiness. Bhagavan said, that can only happen when you identify with me, the imperishable, and not with the one who is conditioned by your body, mind, and intellect. As long as I remain aware of the limitations of the room, I will only be seeing the space as room space. But if I want to see this space as immortal --\n\nIf I never want to get this space destroyed, I'll be always afraid of what happens if someone destroys this building. If earthquake happens or a meteor falls on my property, well, it will be destroyed. Is the room space getting destroyed? But right now I'm more identified with the conditioning than the space itself. And therefore that fear of destruction. If my identification was not with the conditioning, just the space.\n\nThis is my land and this is my space, and I want to own this thing forever. But here's the thing: nothing can destroy the space itself. The only thing that can be destroyed is whatever you have built on that land. The space will never be destroyed. But as long as my identification is with that building on that land, I'll be afraid. When my identification goes beyond that, then I will not be afraid of the destruction of the building.\n\nSo Bhagavan said, one who identifies with me will come to attain me. Antakale cha mam eva kalevaram ya prayati sa mad bhavam yati na asti atra sansayah. There is no doubt that one who gives up this identification with body, mind, and intellect -- treating the leaving of this identification as the death -- and thinking about me alone, will come to me. There is no doubt about that. So the advice we have seen so far says: therefore, tasmat sarveshu kaleshu mam anusmara yudhya cha -- engage in this battle of life constantly remembering me as your true self.\n\nNot this conditioned self as your true self, but me, the imperishable, who is making it possible for you to function. Fight this battle of life with that in mind, and you shall be liberated from these limitations. You will come to be one with me, and once you become one with me, after that there is no coming and going again. Mam upetya punar janma dukhalayam ashashvatam na apnuvanti.\n\nHaving attained me, there is no coming and going back to this house of pain we call this world. But now Bhagavan says, in a stark contrast to the ones who have identified with me and one who has become one with me. If you're striving to achieve that liberation but haven't reached that prerequisite qualification, then you will constantly come back and forth. So the next verse 16 says, A Brahma Bhuvanat lokah punaravartino Arjuna Mam upetya tu Kaunteya punarjanma na vidyate -- all the worlds up to the world of Brahmaji, Brahmaloka, are subject to birth and rebirth. Punara vartina -- constantly coming again and again, coming back to the same cycle.\n\nOne who reaches me, there is no rebirth for him. So what does that mean, reaching up to the world of Brahmaji? Brahmaji is the creator. As we know in our Hindu Trinity, Brahma is the creator, Vishnu is the sustainer and Shiva is the destroyer. This creation, sustenance, and destruction is constantly going on in this world. Brahma is the ultimate creator of this entire universe. In our concept of Hiranyagarbha in Vedanta, Brahma represents the ultimate creator -- the total mind and total intellect. I am the creator of my own world. You are the creator of your world, and she is the creator of her world. We create our world through our mind and intellect, depending on our desires and vasanas. Now, if I take this group and look at it as one -- individually we have our vasanas and desires, but we also have group vasanas and desires.\n\nSo we'll say, well, when are we going to have the Janmastami next? So everybody will say, well, I would like to have it on such and such and let's do this and let's do that. These common thoughts put together what we call it a planning, a group planning will have group activity. So that's a mind which is expanded from my mind to a group's mind. You can continue to expand this mind and intellect, including more and more people and beings into it. When you reach the ultimate limit of all the beings and things, all the minds and intellects put together -- that is Brahmaji, Brahma the creator.\n\nWhen my identification rises from me to my family, to my neighborhood, to my community, I'm expanding my identity and including them as my own self. So I may be making progress in my spiritual evolution by expanding my identity, but until I reach that pre-qualifying limit, I still have to come back over and over again.\n\nWell, it is something like this. If you are taking any licensing examination -- for those of you who are professionals who have to take the licensing exam, you probably know all about it. I took mine in this country when I came here in 1984, and I knew that it was going to be difficult because I had barely come here, had no experience in this country, and people had already warned me: it's going to take you a long time to get this license, simply because there were nine parts to the exam and you have to clear all nine parts to get a license.\n\nSo the firm I had joined initially a large firm, and there were at least about a couple of hundred people, at least at any given year, there are about 60 to 80 people taking exams. So they told me, \"Take it easy, Neil. You just came to this country; it's going to take you eight to ten years before you can pass this exam.\" And I said, \"What do you mean by that? I don't understand what you're saying. Why should it take so long?\" They said, \"Well, here is how it works.\"\n\n\"You'll take the exams and probably pass maybe two parts out of nine. Then you will come back next year and may pass another couple of parts, then come back the year after and may pass one or two.\" People who experienced this had formulated an average: it takes about six to ten years for somebody to get licensed as an architect in this country after graduating from architecture school. Because until you pass all nine parts -- and if you fail any one subject more than three times, you take all nine parts all over again. There were some people I knew who had already given up taking these licensing exams. I said, \"Well, all you have to do is pass all nine parts and it will be fine.\" They said, \"Yeah, that sounds easy, but it is not.\" That was obviously their perception.\n\nSo they go, take the exam, come back, take the exam and come back -- till you reach a point when the ninth part is cleared, then you get a license. And even after passing all nine parts and getting a license, you still have to maintain your continuing education to remain effective as an architect.\n\nThis is something like our spiritual journey. Bhagavan said that we are all pursuing our spiritual evolution as seekers, reaching from the level we are at right now to the next level as we make more progress. But at the time of death, if my evolution has not risen to the level where I can be liberated, I'll have to come back -- just as with the exams.\n\nIf I haven't cleared all nine parts, I have to come back next year to clear whatever parts are left. Same way, in our spiritual journey, things we have learned and things yet to be learned will decide how many times I have to come back. This is driven by my desires and vasanas. My desires will make me come back to that state, that stage where I feel comfortable that I can make progress from here. After I pass my high school graduation, I go to undergraduate school. I cannot just say, \"After my high school graduation, leave me alone -- my education is finished.\"\n\nTo get to a doctorate level, I have to make my own efforts. So up to the world of Brahmaji. In the world of Brahmaji, you have the identification with this entire creation. And as Swamiji explains here that in the concept of gradual liberation, Karma Mukti, which is accepted in Vedanta, it basically says that karma with Upasana can lead you to the realm of Brahmaji. If you do your karma diligently with devotion to the Lord, you will reach a state of identification where you will feel the whole world is your own being and you reach the world of Brahmaji. Once reaching that, there is no coming back.\n\nFrom that, you will just merge into the supreme Brahman.",
      "reflection": "\"A Brahma bhuvana lokah punar avartino Arjuna\"—even up to the world of Brahma, all realms are subject to return. This teaching shatters any notion of a permanent heavenly destination short of complete liberation. The analogy of professional licensing examinations is illuminating: just as you must pass all nine parts to become a licensed architect, you must complete your entire spiritual curriculum to achieve liberation. Failing any part means returning to retake it. Consider your own spiritual \"exam results\": What subjects have you mastered? What areas still need work? Patience, forgiveness, non-attachment, selfless service—which of these do you still struggle with? Each challenge in life is an examination. Each failure is simply an invitation to return and try again until mastery is achieved.\n\nThe cosmic scale presented here—one day of Brahma equals a thousand yugas, approximately 4.32 billion years—puts our earthly concerns in perspective. Your current frustrations, achievements, and dramas are occurring within a cosmic blink. Verse 18 describes how all beings stream forth at the dawn of Brahma's day and dissolve back into the unmanifest at cosmic night. Your individual existence is part of this vast breathing rhythm of the universe. This week, practice holding this expanded perspective when you encounter stress or conflict. Ask yourself: \"In the scale of Brahma's day, how significant is this problem?\" This is not to dismiss your real concerns, but to loosen the grip of identification. The teaching points to the one place beyond this cosmic rhythm: \"Mam upetya tu Kaunteya punar janma na vidyate\"—reaching Me, there is no rebirth. What would it mean to identify with the eternal witness of this cosmic dance rather than being swept along as a participant?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 8, Akshara Brahma Yoga Yoga of Imperishable Brahman as we have seen that we are trying to understand the nature of the supreme reality, so we have to do some heavy lifting here to understand the underlying concepts. In the beginning, we heard from Bhagavan that Brahman is imperishable, immutable, and self-knowledge is its nature. What is the nature of Brahman? It is self-knowledge. It does not require any other aid to understand it. It is self-effulgent.\n\nIt's very nature is self knowledge. With its creative force, it works to create things and beings. What his work is that which creates these things and beings. That Brahman which is imperishable, its nature is self knowledge. With its own creative force, it works to create things and beings. Then what is nature of the things and beings that Brahman has created?\n\nBrahman is imperishable, but anything that is created by its creative force is perishable. That because the very act of creation gives it a birth date, it's now created. Something is created, therefore it will have its own life. Then it will get destroyed. It will have a limited shelf life as we call it, no matter how long. That is what makes those things and beings function as they are.\n\nThe Daivam is that same Brahman remaining within each created entity -- that Daivam makes the thing or being possible as a creation. And when these things and beings are reacting with each other, it's only possible because Brahman remains present as the Yajnam in all the activities -- that Supreme Being is present in every action. Therefore all activities are possible in this world of created beings. The analogy we have heard before is like my dream. I as the conscious being have experiences in my waking world.\n\nThe same experiences at night gets all jumbled up. My mind creates its own world. Out of my own mind, I create my own world. That mind by itself creates various entities, things and beings in My dream. Those entities are acting in the dream because I am in and through available to project the dream. But when I wake up, all those entities, things and beings are now unmanifest.\n\nTill next time I go to sleep again and dream again. So this is what we have seen is how the overall cosmos is functioning at the level of Brahman. Him remaining supreme, unchangeable with his self knowledge, with his own creative force, he works to create these things and beings. These things and beings, their Gunana Dharma. I studied chemistry in Gujarati -- because I studied all throughout my school days and college days in Gujarati medium. In chemistry they used to ask us, \"Padarthana Gunadharmanu Varnan karo\" -- describe the characteristics and nature of this substance. So there are two things every substance has: Guna and Dharma.\n\nGuna is the basic characteristics of that substance or a thing or a being. And Dharma is the nature of that substance depending on guna. So what is my Dharma is depending on my gunas. The gunas which I have as an entity creates my Dharma. So Guna and Dharma are related to each other. So Brahman creating things and beings.\n\nEach thing and being has its own Dharma, Guna and Dharma. This Guna and Dharma continues to change as we acquire more impressions. So my guna before I went to architecture school has nothing to do with architecture. In fact, I was not even aware of what architecture is all about. So at that point my Dharma had nothing to do with architectural knowledge or practice. More I acquired the architectural knowledge.\n\nMy gunas changed, so my Dharma changed. So now I practice architecture. So Guna Dharma is constantly changing this evolutionary path a thing or being takes in the creation itself. So Bhagavan said that this creation is now guided by its own laws, where each thing and being is driven by their own Guna and Dharma. What will be my next state of existence? It depends on the gunas which I am creating through my experiences -- as a practicing architect or as a Bhagavad Gita student.\n\nSo my next state of existence can only be evolution from a present state. It cannot completely change overnight from where I am today. So that's the evolutionary path each thing and being in the creation takes. So from some stardust, my original evolution started and then that keeps changing. Gunanayana Dharma came to this level where I am today. I read in some one of these popular science books that our atoms in the body continues to change.\n\nThey are not the same atoms, because our body's cells change every few years. And they said it is possible that the atoms which existed in Shakespeare's body or Rama's body or Krishna's body have passed through my body at one point -- because there is a finite amount of energy, a finite amount of matter, and all things and beings are created out of that. The nature of this cosmos is that one thing changes into the shape and form of another and continues.\n\nSo where I am today is the product of my past -- from that stardust to who I am today. My future would be the product of my present plus my past. The advice then given to us is this: if you want to accelerate this evolution and not go through this gradual path of changing Guna and Dharma, you can directly relate to the Source. We have seen that Brahman is imperishable, immutable, and created this universe out of his own creative force as the efficient cause.\n\nMaterial cause was the only thing available to Brahman, which is his own self. He created this universe out of his own self. And each creation has limited life. Creation remains perishable, but the underlying material which creates this universe remains imperishable. So either I can identify with my Guna and a Dharma today and then take a step next forward in the same path of my evolution, or I can short circuit this whole cycle and go straight to my source where I started. So that's the advice in this chapter.\n\nAt the time of death -- death is the end of this state of existence. The death of today will create tomorrow. At the time of this transition, whatever I think would be my next state of existence, that's what I will become. Bhagawan said, you can focus directly on the Source and become the Source. Up to Brahma Loka, the world of Brahma, everything has coming and going. As long as we are within the realm of this Prakriti -- which is made up of nothing but the total things and beings in this world -- I will keep recycling from one state of existence to another.\n\nAnd we have said how long this will continue -- as long as Brahma is creating and dissolving. We see our own day and night in our day-to-day activities. Day is the active part of my life. Night is the inactive part of my life. Superimposing the same concept on Brahmaji, the total creator:\n\nI am the creator of my world. You are the creator of your world. She is the creator of her world. When you put all things and beings together, all the ideas and vasanas and thoughts together create cosmic mind. The cosmic mind has the latency to create this cosmos. And that's called Hiranyagarpa, the golden embryo, which is all the possibilities of creating everything that is in this cosmos that continues to be go in the cycles of activity and inactivity.\n\nWhen Brahma is actively creating, it's his day. When he takes rest and is inactive, it's night for him. We superimpose our experience: my day is activity, my night is inactivity. It's not so different now with nightlife, but 5,000 years ago they probably didn't have nightlife. So what is Brahma's day? Brahma's day is a thousand eons. So for thousand eons this activity of creation continues. Things changing from one thing to another to another. And then Brahmaji takes rest. All the things which he has created now goes into dormant state. Not destroyed, but in a dormant state.\n\nJust as I, the architect, goes into dormant state from Friday to Sunday. But that doesn't mean the architect in me has died. Architect in me will wake up on Monday morning and start all over again. So all the ideas and thoughts and vasanas in this total mind go into hibernation, into a dormant state. How long does that last? Another thousand eons.\n\nSo we did some calculation the other day: 4.32 billion years is one day. A thousand of these makes 4.32 billion years, and you take two of them -- day and night -- that's 8.6-something billion years, one complete cycle. So when you think about your journey, this is what continues from day to night, day and night, from one state of existence to another. And if you as the entity are not really happy about it, then there is an escape hatch: take refuge in me, identify with the Source.\n\nAs long as I'm watching David Copperfield performing magic, it's wonderful to watch and get enchanted by it and then keep thinking, how does he do it? Till one day I show up when he is preparing for his show and say, I want to be your apprentice, sir. And he takes me and then he shows me and then I see how all these tricks are done and then all magic is gone. Now I'm not confused. Now when he's cutting the lady in half, I know exactly what he's doing. Till that time, I have to keep coming back. Till I reach Brahma Loka, the Creator's own world, I will be coming back into the same cycle. But then when I reach there and identify with the source, I will become one with that. So it gives us a scale. My quest in life to achieve happiness is not a short-term thing, even though I put it in short-term goals and long-term goals. But in the end I want happiness. If you just extend that quest to Brahma's day and night and work towards your goal, the only way to achieve that is to identify with the source. Avyakta d vyaktayaha Sarvaha prabhavanti aha Agame. So all those things in beings with all their guna and Dharma are in dormant state. When Brahmaj is inactive, which we consider as a dissolution. Pralaya, Vishnu, lying in a Kshira, Shira, Samudra, milky ocean.\n\nThere are no vasanas, pure Sattva, then there is no activity. If it is pure Sattva, there is no activity. Rajas and Tamas has to be there. So when you are in a pure state of Sattva, there is no activity. But all other things in being there in dormant state. All the other thoughts are in dormant state.\n\nJust as when I go to sleep, all my thoughts about what I'm going to be doing next week are in dormant state. Not that I've forgotten anything about it. I'm just in dormant state. As soon as I wake up on Monday morning, we all come into being and becomes my work and my activity and my creation. Avyakta, vyaktaha, sarvaha prabhavanti ahaha made the arrival of the day. All those who were unmanifest now becomes manifest in all those who are manifest during the day.",
      "reflection": "These verses introduce the concept of Guna and Dharma—the characteristics that define who we are and the duties that arise from them. The teaching that \"where I am today is the product of my past\" and \"my future would be the product of my present\" offers both responsibility and hope. You are not trapped by your current limitations; you are simply at one point on an evolutionary journey that stretches across lifetimes. The fascinating scientific observation that our atoms are constantly recycling—that atoms once in Shakespeare's or Krishna's body may have passed through yours—points to the material interconnectedness of all existence. This week, reflect on your own Guna-Dharma evolution: What qualities did you have ten years ago that have now transformed? What new capacities have emerged? What qualities are you currently cultivating that will shape your future self?\n\nVerse 20 reveals there is something beyond even the unmanifest Prakriti from which creation emerges: \"Paras tasmat tu bhavo anyo avyakto avyaktat sanatanah\"—\"Beyond this unmanifest is another Unmanifest, eternal, which does not perish when all beings perish.\" This is the ultimate goal—not just a better position within the cycle, but transcendence of the cycle itself. The analogy of watching a magician perform is apt: as long as you sit in the audience, you are enchanted by the illusion. But when you become the magician's apprentice and learn how the tricks work, the magic dissolves into understanding. Verse 21 promises: \"Yam prapya na nivartante\"—having reached this, one does not return. This is not a distant goal. The teaching offers a \"short circuit\": rather than evolving slowly through countless incarnations, you can go directly to the Source through knowledge and devotion. Today, ask yourself: Am I content to improve my position within the dream, or am I ready to wake up?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter eight, Imperishable Brahman. We are coming to the last concluding verses of this chapter. In chapter seven, we learned about the nature of the supreme as the Higher Prakriti and the Lower Prakriti. He said, my Lower Prakriti is Eightfold Prakriti which is manifest. My Higher Prakriti which supports this lower Prakriti. So that higher Prakriti is the imperishable Brahman, which is the substratum for this Lower Prakriti.\n\nThat which is manifest is supported by that which is Unmanifest. That Unmanifest is the Supreme Brahman, the Imperishable. So chapter eight is our quest to understand the imperishable Brahman. We've been discussing the nature of the Imperishable Brahman. In the beginning we have learned that the nature of that supreme reality is imperishable. He is self knowing and in his work is to create these things and beings.\n\nThat same supreme reality creates these things and beings as Prakriti -- the Lower Prakriti, out of his own self. So the world which we see is the manifest world, but it is supported by the Unmanifest. The Unmanifest is imperishable, but the world which it creates is perishable. Prakriti is infinite, just as Brahman is infinite. Prakriti is ever-existing, just as Brahman is ever-existing. But the creations within Prakriti are perishable, because the same entity which creates these things and beings will keep creating and destroying. Brahma, the Creator, while he is working -- that's his day.\n\nWhen he's not working, that's his night. And we have seen that how long the Brahma's day is compared to hours. Then in the end we have talked about how can the individual ego, the individual entity which finds itself to be limited by these limitations of mind and intellectual, can rise above this limitations and reach the Supreme. Why I'm suffering through my limitations. And therefore there are Sorrows. If I was having no limitation, there will not be any sorrow.\n\nSo my quest in life is to get over all my limitations. So when I transit from one existence to another, my goal is always to get to a stage which has less limitations or no limitations. So we talked about the one who dies with that thought of imperishable in mind will lead the imperishable. One who dies with the goal of achieving something will get to that state of achievement. Those who worship Devas will go to Devas. Those who worship Brahman will go to Brahman.\n\nThen we elaborately discussed how to get to that point where we can think about that goal. Verse 21, which was the last one we discussed, says: Avyakto Akshara iti uktah tam ahuh paramam gatim. That which is considered the unmanifest, imperishable -- that is your highest goal. They who reach it never again return. Yam prapya na nivartante. Everyone else has to come back because of some goal or other.\n\nSome desire or other which is unfulfilled. And I want to fulfill it. I want to achieve their capabilities and then achieve that goal. So to achieve that, now I'm in a pursuit of happiness. Because my happiness is somewhere else. I have to come back to pursue my happiness.\n\nBut one who wants to achieve that happiness which is supreme, then he doesn't have to come back. And therefore it says that your goal is to achieve that unmanifest and imperishable that is considered the highest goal. They who reach it never again return. Bhagwan says, that is my highest abode. That's what my my abode is. All this time we had been discussing and thinking about what is the nature of the Lord and where does he reside.\n\nHe says, that is my abode and that's my nature. My nature is supreme, imperishable, unmanifest. My abode is that state of awareness -- that's where you will find me. So the next seven verses, which are the concluding verses, say: Purushah sa parah partha bhaktya labhyas tu ananyaya. Is it ever possible to achieve that state of oneness with the imperishable Brahman?\n\nRight now I can achieve oneness with my own limitations -- \"this is me.\" I can also relate to other things in the world and achieve oneness. But it is unthinkable right now to achieve oneness with the supreme imperishable Brahman. Bhagavan gives a guarantee here: it is achievable by Bhaktya labhyas tu ananyaya -- by single-pointed devotion. Single-pointed identification with that imperishable Brahman.\n\nAs long as I'm identified with something else, I cannot be identifying with that. As long as I'm identified with my body, my intellect there is no way that I can identify with him. So Bhagavan said, it is possible for Purusha, any person to achieve that by single pointed devotion. That's the only path.\n\nYasyantahasthani Bhutani. That single pointed devotion for what? That which is the indwelling for all beings. I am trying to achieve understanding about myself. But in that inward journey I have to realize that myself is not just limited to my limited self but it is the self of all the beings. Yesyanta sthani Bhutani.\n\nThat's the dwelling place for all beings. Yena sarvam idam tatam -- everything is pervaded by it. That entity with which I want to identify is the dwelling place for all beings and things. With single-pointed devotion, I'm identifying with that. We can very easily identify with people and things similar to us. We have difficulty identifying with people who are a little different from us.\n\nThey speak different language, they look different. It's a way I can overcome that. But then I have to identify with entire Jagat and it goes even beyond that and says there is nothing in this universe cosmos where the self is not pervaded. In my inward journey of meditation I have to understand and identify with that entity which does not leave anything out. If I say I love this, but I hate this, well, I have limited him. I created limitation for him and therefore my journey is incomplete.\n\nSo now Bhagavan said that I will explain to you how to reach there. And he said there are two paths. Yatra kale to anavrutyam avruttim chevayogina. Well, first qualification. You should be a Yogi.\n\nYou are the one who is striving to achieve this liberation that's given. But the striving alone will not guarantee that you will achieve liberation. Because the path you may take. He said he will explain the time and path while parting from this state of existence: one which is the path of return, and one which is the path of no return. We have been trying -- people have been trying -- but we continue to come back to the same world of sorrow.\n\nPrayatha Yanti Tamkalam Vakyami Bharata Sabah. So I will let you know what path will lead you to no return. I also let you know what the path of return. So that's basically just an introduction to the next two verses. Next is Agnihi Jyotihi Ahaha, Shuklaha Shanmasa, Uttarayanam Tatra, Prayahata, Gachanti, Brahma, Brahma Vidojanaha. These two mantas are very, very difficult to understand because from a superficial translation it makes no sense whatsoever.\n\nIt says Agni, Jyoti, Ahaha -- fire, light, daytime -- Shuklaha, the bright fortnight, in six months of Uttarayanam. Tatra Prayata Gachanti Brahma, Brahma Vidojanaha -- one who goes through that path, they go to Brahman, the path of no return. The Yogi who knows Brahman goes through this path of light. So now, if we take this literally, that means people who die during these six months have a chance to get liberated, and the other six months have no chance. December 22 to June 21 you get liberation, and after June 22 to December 21 people have to return. That obviously makes no sense. Swamiji explains here that you have to remember the Gita is the essence of Upanishads. Sarva Upanishado Gavo, Dugdham Gopala Nandanam -- all Upanishads are cows, and Gopala Nandana (Krishna) has collected the milk and given it to you. He is the one who collected all the ideas and concepts from the Upanishads and put them in the Bhagavad Gita. You have to study the Upanishads to understand these concepts. These particular two verses about the path of Uttarayana and Dakshinayana are directly taken from the Prashna Upanishad. The Prashna Upanishad elaborately explains the path of Uttarayana and Dakshinayana.\n\nIt starts with explaining the creation of this universe -- that Prajapati himself became the sun and the moon. The sun represents energy; the moon represents matter. Then it also explains how the year is created, how a month is created, how a day is created -- one represents energy, the other matter. Anything during the day represents energy. We know that daytime is the domain of the sun -- sunlight, energy, activity. Nighttime is presided over by the moon -- its inactivity.\n\nDarkness -- that's the path of the Moon. So the two paths were thought of as the path of energy and the path of matter; the path of the Sun. With Krama Mukti, the gradual liberation through Upasana and Karmas, you reach through the path of the sun to the Brahmaloka. We also know that we can gradually improve ourselves.\n\nSo the good actions are necessary. But we also know that doing good is not good enough. It has to be associated with knowledge. So that is the difference between the two parts. One who is doing good but with a goal of getting something good out of it -- that is the path of return. One who is doing good but without seeking anything in return, seeking only to liberate himself -- those selfless actions are the path of no return. These two are symbolically described in Upanishadic language as the Path of Uttarayana and the Path of Dakshinayana. Another way to look at it: when we face the sun in the morning, we are facing east. On your right side is south, and your left side is north. So the path of Dakshinayana is the sun rising from the east, going through the south, and setting in the west. The path of the north is the path of the rising sun.\n\nAnd the path of the south is the path of the setting sun. So we are going from the rising sun to daytime, from the setting sun to nighttime. If we associate knowledge and the sacred with the path of the rising sun, that is the path of Uttarayana; the path of the setting sun is the path of Dakshinayana. Both describe the mental makeup of a yogi -- one who is seeking liberation versus one who will come back to enjoy. If you listen to political conventions, if you just look at how the nominee is described, it looks like they're sages.\n\nThey're only driven by the common good. They just wanted to do nothing but help people. So if that is true, then he's a sage. But if you take that and see that they are not only doing good, but they also have their own good in mind. They want to achieve something out of it. At the path of return, you're constantly coming back to do good so that you can get something out of it.\n\nBhagawan said it is exactly the same for the yogi. The Prashna Upanishad describes in detail that those who want to gain something out of their good actions are on the path of return. And we have seen in earlier verses that during Brahma's night, all beings are in a dormant state, and when creation starts, they emerge from whatever unfulfilled desires remain and come back into this universe again.",
      "reflection": "\"Bhaktya labhyas tu ananyaya\"—the Supreme is attainable through single-pointed devotion alone. This verse addresses a common concern: Is liberation actually possible for ordinary people like us? Krishna answers emphatically: yes, but the key is \"ananya\"—undivided, exclusive devotion. This does not mean abandoning responsibilities; it means having only one ultimate allegiance while performing all duties. Examine your divided loyalties today. We easily identify with people similar to us but struggle with those who appear different. Yet the teaching says we must identify with \"that in which all beings abide and which pervades the entire universe.\" This week, practice expanding your circle of identification. When you meet someone who seems very different from you, look for the common awareness that animates both of you. That shared consciousness is the Supreme Self dwelling equally in all.\n\nVerses 23-24 introduce the symbolic paths of Uttarayana (northern course) and Dakshinayana (southern course). Rather than being literal astronomical timings for death, these represent mental and spiritual states. The path of \"fire, light, daytime, bright fortnight\" symbolizes the illuminated mind filled with knowledge. The opposite path represents the mind clouded with ignorance and attachment. The practical question becomes: What path is your mind currently traveling? Is it moving toward greater light, clarity, and selflessness (Uttarayana)? Or toward greater attachment, confusion, and self-centeredness (Dakshinayana)? The good news is that unlike the literal sun's path, your mental path can be changed at any moment through conscious choice. Today, notice moments when your mind moves toward darkness—worry, resentment, craving—and gently redirect it toward light. Each redirection is a practice run for the ultimate journey."

      "commentary": "We have been discussing chapter eight and we are coming to the conclusion of chapter eight. Akshara Brahma Yoga, Yoga of Imperishable Brahman. So let's see what we have seen so far in Bhagavad Gita. We are almost at the midpoint of Bhagavad Gita. The teachings in Bhagavad Gita are basically telling us that you are not this limited self; your real nature is the supreme Self. The journey from this limited self to the supreme self is the quest of human life.\n\nSo Bhagavan has indicated in chapter one what this limited life is like using Arjuna's situation, that the life is not clearly divided between good and evil, or situations which are black and white, but they come in various shades of gray. And to learn to deal with it is the wisdom. So Bhagawan gave Arjuna the guidance and encapsulated that guidance in Bhagavad Gita for the generations to come, so that we can use the same guidance given to Arjuna for our own lives. So Bhagavan had given Arjuna in the second chapter, a clear indication of what is reality and what is superimposition on the reality. Bhagawan said, we consider ourselves to be mortal beings, but we are immortal beings identified with mortal bodies. This identification is creating all the confusion.\n\nSo the goal of life is to get rid of this ignorance about the supreme Self. He defined a man of wisdom, Sthita Prajna -- the one who has balanced his mind and can see the situation clearly without getting tainted by it. Bhagawan gave that wisdom in a nutshell to Arjuna. We learned that what we consider ourselves to be is not really ourselves. We are not limited beings. We are immortal beings identified with mortal bodies. Bhagavan described a man of wisdom -- a Sthita Prajna who sees this clearly because of the purification of his internal instrument. He understands that the self is different than this body, mind and intellect, and the one who is not attached, who is desireless, will achieve this wisdom. The path was then given in the following chapters: how to act in this world without desires or attachment. Chapter three gave us Karma Yoga, with the simple indication that we have no control over the results of our actions, but we do have the right to act.\n\nI have right to act, but I cannot anticipate a particular result. Therefore I should act without any anticipation or expectation -- that's the simple first step. The second step, in chapter four: Bhagavan said you should come to the understanding that the self is not the doer. The self that you call \"I\" is not participating in any activity. Activities are performed by the body, mind, and intellect -- matter reacting with matter. But the self is not involved.\n\nTherefore in chapter five he says, you should give up the sense of agency -- \"I am the doer.\" Everything is happening at the body level, at the mind level, at the intellect level, but \"I\" is not involved. I am not doing anything; \"I\" is not participating in any of these activities. Chapter six then culminated in Dhyana Yoga, the Yoga of Meditation.\n\nHow can I contemplate on the real self? Thoughts of the same species, of the same type, when directed towards the goal -- that is called meditation. Meditation is to constantly think about the Supreme Self that I am. My Atma is none other than the Paramatma; that thought held constantly is meditation. Bhagawan defined meditation, the path of meditation, and the techniques of meditation in chapter six.\n\nThe second segment of Bhagavad Gita, as we have discussed many times, is about the Supreme Self. The first segment was about Tvam, the \"you\" part of Tattvamasi. The next six chapters are all about Tat, that Supreme. We defined Tvam, which is right now identified as the little ego.\n\nTat is the Supreme Self. And if I have to contemplate on that, I need to understand the nature of the supreme self. So in seventh chapter we learned the two aspects of that supreme reality. One is the lower Prakriti, made of the Eightfold manifestation -- Bhumi, Apah, Analah, Vayu, Kham -- that which we can perceive through our senses is the representation of that lower Prakriti. Beyond this lower Prakriti is the Higher Prakriti, which becomes the knower of this lower Prakriti; the self in us becomes the knower, the unmanifest aspect of that self. Bhagavan said, my real nature is beyond these two, and that is veiled by Maya.\n\nThat real nature is not available to all of us because it is veiled by Maya. Bhagawan defined Maya as the total conditioning of Ishwara. When that Maya operates at my individual level, it becomes ignorance -- Avidya. This Avidya is not letting me cross Maya itself. So in chapter 8, Bhagavan has given us the means to overcome this Maya.\n\nSo we have started this chapter 8 with clear definitions of all these terms we come across. So we have learned that the supreme reality is veiled by Maya. And this projection of the multitude of beings and multitude of realities in physical world is projected through Maya. In the very first verse, Arjuna asked question which basically defines all these terms for us. These terms -- Adhi Yajna and others -- we want clarified for our understanding. If you want to contemplate on the supreme Self, then we need to understand the differentiation between Adhi Bhuta, Adhi Daiva, and Brahman. Brahman is the supreme reality, one without a second. Adhibhuta is the perishable nature of the reality which we experience.\n\nAnd Adhi Daivam is my own Swabhava. When it operates through me, it becomes Adhi Devam. And Bhagawan in the end said that I alone am the Adhi Yajnam. All the experiences which you have at an individual level are experienced by none other than the supreme self -- because the Self is real. Everything else is nothing but superimposition on it. Therefore Bhagawan says you must identify with this supreme Self to get over this Maya, this superimposition. In the discussion of what happens at the time of departure from this level of existence, we have seen two terms: Antakala and Prayanakala. Antakala is my preparation time -- I have to prepare for this journey. This existence is limited, which is a given, but there will be another existence right after that.\n\nSo if I was not really satisfied with my current existence, then I'm obviously looking for a better existence next time. Bhagawan says, that better existence is dependent on how you prepare and how you end this existence. Whatever you are thinking at the time of your departure, that's the destination you will reach. So Bhagawan said, therefore think about me all the time -- that destination which holds the ultimate happiness that you are seeking.\n\nThat world without sorrow, without any limitations, without any conditioning. And we have seen that that world is only at the level of Brahman. All the lokas up to Brahma's world are subject to repeated return -- that's called the path of repeated return. We have seen that Maya has three aspects: Tamas, Rajas, and Sattva. Any existence is nothing but a permutation and combination of these three Gunas.\n\nIf I am at a level where Tamas is predominant, then I am at the level of complete ignorance. When I rise from that level to the next level, then obviously the Rajas increases and then Tamas reduces. If I rise even further, then the Sattva increases, Rajas diminishes and Tamas diminishes. I can go all the way up to the level of pure Sattva. But as long as I am in Rajas and Tamas, I have to come back to a level of existence which has beginning and end -- that is the path of repeated return. But there is also a path of no return: you have to cross this Prakriti, this Maya. When you cross this Prakriti, there is no coming back to mortal existence. That is the path of no return.\n\nThose two paths are described in the last few verses. The confusion obviously was: is there a particular time, a particular moment, a particular method in which one can depart and not return, or return? Those two paths we have been discussing: Agnihi Jyotihi Ahah Shuklaha Shanmasa Uttarayanam Tatra Prayata Gachanti Brahma Brahma Vido Janaha. This path is called Devayana, the Divine path -- the path which leads to no return. The path of fire, light, daytime, bright fortnight, the six months of the northern solstice. Following this path, men who know Brahman go to Brahman -- the wise people who acquired this knowledge.\n\nTherefore we are going through Gnana, Vignana, Yoga. Knowledge about my supreme self is Gnana. And applying it in my life to get over these limitations is Vignana. So Brahma says, the one who has applied this, he is following the bright path. And these are probably symbolically indicated in Upanishads or how our mind sees this world. So when our mind is cheerful, we associate with the bright and sunny atmosphere.\n\nSo there is a climate outside and a climate inside my mind. Those two are related to each other but not really connected. The climate outside may be very bright and sunny, but my mind inside may be very gloomy -- that will not let me enjoy the world outside. But if I can synchronize the two, then my mind is feeling the same bright atmosphere inside as is outside. And maybe that's what was indicated here.\n\nI can keep my mind in the same bright atmosphere of knowledge and then leave this existence. Then I will achieve the state of Brahman, Brahma, Vidojanaha. People who know Brahman will always be following this bright path. And one who knows Brahman, he obviously is not going to desire for anything less than Brahman. If I have known that I own a billion dollar trust fund somewhere, obviously I want to achieve that and not go for a smaller gain in life. So we have known this ultimate goal of achieving that state of imperishableness.\n\nThey will follow the path of Brahman so that the path was identified Uttarayanam or Devayanam. In the contrast to that, the path which we typically associate with is labeled as Dakshinayanam or Pitrayanam. So the path of ancestors or the southern path. That path, in contrast to the previous one, is followed by people who are not aware of the nature of Brahman, who have not realized that there is an existence without any conditioning. As we have said, the conditioning at my individual level is Avidya. Ignorance about myself has created this conditioning through identification with body, mind, and intellect.\n\nIdentifying with walls, floor, and ceiling creates room space. I, the self, identifying with this body, mind, and intellect, create this Jiva as a limited entity existing in this pluralistic world. When I leave this body, this existence, with only the understanding that I'm a limited being trying to achieve a higher standard of living, then I'll reach that stage. But when I exhaust my Punya, I'll come back to start working at it again. That's basically the path of return -- I have to work for 50 weeks for two weeks of vacation. Once the two weeks vacation is over, I have to start working for another 50 weeks for two more weeks of vacation.",
      "reflection": "The contrast between Shukla (bright) and Krishna (dark) paths in verse 26 is not about external circumstances but internal orientation. The Devayana (divine path) is followed by those who know Brahman—their actions arise from knowledge and selflessness. The Pitrayana (ancestral path) is followed by those doing good with the expectation of reward. Both paths involve good actions, but the motivation differs completely. This is a crucial distinction for daily practice: When you perform a kind act today, notice your subtle expectations. Do you anticipate gratitude, recognition, or future benefit? That expectation, however reasonable it seems, keeps you on the path of return. Practice performing at least one completely anonymous act of kindness each day—something no one will ever know about, not even your closest confidant. This trains the mind in truly selfless action.\n\nVerse 27 delivers the chapter's practical conclusion: \"Tasmat sarveshu kaleshu yoga-yukto bhava Arjuna\"—\"Therefore, at all times, be established in yoga.\" The saint who understands these two paths is never confused about priorities. He knows that doing good for personal gain, while not wrong, is simply insufficient for liberation. This week, audit your spiritual activities: Are you studying scripture to become more knowledgeable (ego enhancement) or to dissolve ignorance (liberation)? Are you meditating to feel calm (personal benefit) or to realize your true nature (transcendence)? Are you serving others to be recognized as a good person (reputation) or because you see the Divine in them (devotion)? There is nothing wrong with the first motivation in each pair, but it leads to the path of return. Only the second orientation leads to the path of no return. The teaching invites us to examine not just what we do, but why we do it."

Knowledge about my supreme self is Gnana. And applying it in my life to get over these limitations is Vignana. So Brahma says, the one who has applied this, he is following the bright path. And these are probably symbolically indicated in Upanishads or how our mind sees this world. So when our mind is cheerful, we associate with the bright and sunny atmosphere.\n\nSo there is a climate outside and a climate inside my mind. Those two are related to each other but not really connected. The climate outside may be very bright and sunny, but my mind inside may be very gloomy -- that will not let me enjoy the world outside. But if I can synchronize the two, then my mind is feeling the same bright atmosphere inside as is outside. And maybe that's what was indicated here.\n\nI can keep my mind in the same bright atmosphere of knowledge and then leave this existence. Then I will achieve the state of Brahman, Brahma, Vidojanaha. People who know Brahman will always be following this bright path. And one who knows Brahman, he obviously is not going to desire for anything less than Brahman. If I have known that I own a billion dollar trust fund somewhere, obviously I want to achieve that and not go for a smaller gain in life. So we have known this ultimate goal of achieving that state of imperishableness.\n\nThey will follow the path of Brahman so that the path was identified Uttarayanam or Devayanam. In the contrast to that, the path which we typically associate with is labeled as Dakshinayanam or Pitrayanam. So the path of ancestors or the southern path. That path, in contrast to the previous one, is followed by people who are not aware of the nature of Brahman, who have not realized that there is an existence without any conditioning. As we have said, the conditioning at my individual level is Avidya. Ignorance about myself has created this conditioning through identification with body, mind, and intellect.\n\nIdentifying with walls, floor, and ceiling creates room space. I, the self, identifying with this body, mind, and intellect, create this Jiva as a limited entity existing in this pluralistic world. When I leave this body, this existence, with only the understanding that I'm a limited being trying to achieve a higher standard of living, then I'll reach that stage. But when I exhaust my Punya, I'll come back to start working at it again. That's basically the path of return -- I have to work for 50 weeks for two weeks of vacation. Once the two weeks vacation is over, I have to start working for another 50 weeks for two more weeks of vacation.",
      "reflection": "This concluding verse of Chapter 8 makes a revolutionary claim: the sage who truly understands these teachings \"passes beyond all merit that comes from the study of scriptures, from sacrifice, from austerities, and from charity.\" This does not mean these practices are worthless—they are essential stepping stones. But knowledge of the imperishable Brahman transcends all accumulated merit. Merit (Punya) keeps you on the wheel; it earns you better circumstances for future births. But the goal is to step off the wheel entirely. Reflect on your spiritual resume: How much of your practice is oriented toward accumulating spiritual merit (better rebirth, divine favor, inner peace) versus dissolving the very illusion of a separate self that could accumulate anything?\n\nThe \"Supreme Primeval Abode\" mentioned in this verse is not a location in space but a state of awareness—the recognition that you have always been and will always be the imperishable Brahman wearing the temporary costume of your current identity. Chapter 8 has offered a complete teaching: from Arjuna's seven questions about ultimate reality, through the meditation techniques for realizing it, to the cosmic context of creation and dissolution, to the two paths of return and no-return. The chapter ends where it began—with the imperishable. As you conclude this study, ask yourself: What has genuinely shifted in my understanding? What am I now willing to let go of that I was clinging to before? What does it mean that my true Self—the awareness reading these words right now—is \"Akshara,\" imperishable, and has been present before this body was born and will remain after it dissolves? Let this question accompany you not just in formal meditation, but through every moment of daily life."

      "commentary": "We have started discussing chapter nine, which is the Raja Vidya Rajaguhiya Yoga, the Yoga of the Royal Knowledge and Royal Secret. This is in continuation of what we have discussed in the last two chapters, 7 and 8. In chapter 7 we have seen Gnana Vignana Yoga, Yoga of Knowledge, and Visishtha Gnana, which is applied knowledge -- or what we call wisdom. Wisdom is something we have gained through our own experience. As the saying goes, \"Look at my gray hair. I didn't get this gray hair standing in the sun outside -- all this is experience.\" In other words, what I have learned through my experience became my own knowledge.\n\nSomebody told me something that remained at the information level, then I applied it and it became my own knowledge. That's why in science college you have theoretical classes and then you go to the lab. The same thing you learned there -- that H2O makes water -- you go and experiment with it yourself, and you realize that's what happens. So the first thing we did after finishing the first six chapters was talk about who we are and how we purify our internal instrument by meditation, by all these sadhanas, selfless actions. Now the question is: what are we meditating upon? That is what we need to know. So from chapter seven onward, we started talking about self-knowledge -- knowledge about my own self, removing this paradox where I think \"this is me\" and still worry about what happens to me after death and what happened before my birth.\n\nSo the self-knowledge, the Gnana Vignana Yoga, tells us what is the nature of the Lord and how people approach it. In chapter seven we learned about the Chaturvida Bhakta -- the four types of devotees. Everyone wants to achieve that state of perfect happiness where there is no sorrow, no imperfection in my life. In four ways we approach that. Our quest for that perfectness is described as Aartha, Jijnasu, Artharthi, and Gnani. One is approaching him out of distress.\n\nOne is approaching because he wants to gain something. One is approaching out of curiosity -- is there a state of perfectness? And the last one approaches because out of his own intuition, he knows there is a state of perfectness. Then in the last chapter we discussed the imperishable Brahman. Yes, there is a state which is infinite, imperishable. At that state of existence, we call it Brahman -- that which pervades everywhere and everything.\n\nMy world right now is pervaded by my thoughts, you know, and my thoughts are right now limited. So my world is limited. I can think about the things only which I have experienced in the past, you know, or I heard about it from others or something which I have known from reading the books. But my thoughts are limited to that. Therefore my world is also limited to that. Beyond this world, I'm always afraid or curious.\n\nWhat is beyond my thoughts? Before my birth, I can think about my life as far back as my childhood. I can think about my life in the future as far as I can think. So I had this guy trying to sell me an annuity, and he said this thing gives you lifetime income from whenever you start. I said, when can I start?\n\nHe said, you can start at age 70. I said, my lifetime may not be more than five or six years after that, so your lifetime income doesn't do much for me. He said, why do you say that? I said, by statistical data -- how many people in my family have lived beyond that?\n\nSo I know my future by observing what has happened in my family. So what is beyond that? That's where I get lost. So Bhagavan said that imperishable Brahman is the state of yourself. So in chapter eight we have discussed about the nature of that imperishable Brahman and how I as this limited being fit into that.\n\nThat as long as I identify with this limited intellect in mind, this instrument of ego, I constantly come back and forth because I'm hanging on to that identity. This me is where I am as long as I have that ego. Bhagavan says in the part of your Prakriti, he'll come back again and again taking another instrument of transaction with this world continuing in the same argument. Now chapter nine says, now we'll talk about the royal secret. Why is it a royal secret? Because it is already obvious to you, but you are not aware of it.\n\nIt's right there, but I can't see it. Therefore it's a secret. And it's a royal science, because \"Royal\" -- Rajan, Raja -- connotes supremacy. In a kingdom there is nothing higher than a king. In our case we have the president as the highest authority.\n\nBut he has many people to question him and tell him what he is not doing right. In those kingdoms, the Raja was never questioned. Even though he is not wearing clothes, nobody says the king is not wearing clothes. There was a supreme status. They say this Vidya is a Raja Vidya, the supreme knowledge.\n\nBeyond that there is nothing to be known. That is self-knowledge. I know physics, I know chemistry, I know all these things, I know all the knowledge about arts and everything else. But Bhagavan says there is only one thing you need to know -- about yourself.\n\nAnd there is nothing more to be known. Therefore it is the supreme knowledge in the self knowledge. So the first verse of this chapter starts with Bhagavan's profound statement: Idam tu te guhyatamam pravakshyami anasuya ve. I am going to tell you this. Gnanam Vignana sahitam yad Gnatva mokshyase asubhat.\n\nI'm going to tell you this knowledge along with Visishtagnam -- along with its wisdom, its application. Knowing that, you will be freed from what? From Ashubha and Shubha. Shubha is auspicious, that which is good. Ashubha is not good for me.\n\nAnything in your life which you consider not good, you'll be liberated from that. And we say, well, that's exactly what I was looking for all my life. Get rid of all the problems I have, Bhagavan, then I'll be doing your bhakti forever. Because right now I don't have time -- I'm just fixing my problems.\n\nMy total attention will be yours after that. Bhagavan says, idam tu te guhyatamam. This knowledge which is the deepest, most profound secret. Guhyatamam -- guhya means secret, tamam means most. I'm going to tell you. You know what is the supreme secret?\n\nIt's something nobody can figure out. That's a supreme secret. Other secrets you can figure out by asking someone, but this secret is right in front of you, yet you can't figure it out. Like a person in disguise walking around in a party you see in a movie.\n\nEverybody sees him but nobody figures out who he is. And he said, I'm going to tell you this because you're anasuya ve. We have heard last time, you're a person who does not cavil or carp, who does not raise petty arguments or petty objections. Sometimes people come to a lecture to find out how smart the speaker is, to see whether he knows anything. Then they will find fault in it.\n\nSee, if you give an example and say, our life is short, but the sun is there forever, suddenly somebody says, well that's not true, the sun is not there forever. I can tell you how it works. But that was not the intention of the speaker in giving that analogy -- to give you a relationship. But because your purpose is only to see what the speaker does not know.\n\nSo you are carping at him, raising petty objections, pointing out petty faults and errors. Because you are not truly, genuinely interested in understanding. The person who is like that is obviously not going to learn, because his mind is not in learning things -- his mind is in finding out where the faults lie. So therefore he says, I'm going to tell you the deepest of secrets, the most profound secret. Because so far you have proved that you are a genuine seeker of this knowledge. You really want to find out how to get rid of sorrows from your life, how to readjust your thinking pattern so you can function right in this world. Having known the Gnanam vignana sahitam yad gnatva mokshyase asubhat -- after that you will get rid of all that is ashubha, sorrowful, not conducive in your life.\n\nBhagavan, that's what I've been looking for! If you can tell me, then after this, once I know: every time I buy a lottery, I'll be the winner. Every time I submit a proposal, I'll be the winner. Every time I put a contract on a property, I'll be the winner -- because you told me that after knowing this, there will not be any sorrow in your life.\n\nYou'll be just a winner. You'll never be a loser. Bhagavan said, that's not what it means. What it means is that after knowing this, you will not see anything happening in your life as inherently good or bad. Right now, my definition of good and bad is defined by what I want and what I want to reject. Everything which I want to reject is Ashubha. Everything I want is Shubha.\n\nThere is a story of a father who goes to visit his two daughters. One was married to a pot maker, another was married to a farmer. He went to the daughter married to the farmer and said, \"What's happening?\" She said, \"Oh, this was a wonderful season, a lot of rains, and we are doing very well. Oh Lord, keep continuing doing that!\" Then he goes to the other daughter's house, the one married to the pot maker. \"So how are things going?\" She said, \"Pretty bad this year. There was no sun. It was raining all the time. We couldn't really bake any pots, so we are really not doing well. Hope the Lord does something and stops this rain.\" So the father thinks, \"Oh Lord, please stop this rain so that my daughter will be happy.\" But what can a father do? Same situation -- one sees it as Shubha, the other sees it as Ashubha.\n\nThe Shubha and Ashubha, as we are saying, are projections of our mind. We create this Shubha and Ashubha in our life. Once I fix my perception of how to see the world, I may not find anything Ashubha in it.\n\nThere's this story in the Mahabharata. Yudhishthir and Duryodhan were both under the same teacher. The teacher said, \"I have one test for both of you.\" He calls Yudhishthir first and says, \"Go and find one bad person from this town.\" Yudhishthir goes off. Then he called Duryodhan and said, \"Go and find one good person from this town.\" After a while, Yudhishthir comes back. The teacher asks, \"Where is the bad person I asked you to bring?\" He said, \"I'm so sorry, but I couldn't find anybody bad in this town.\" Then Duryodhan comes back. \"Where is the good person I asked you to bring?\" He said, \"I'm so sorry, but I couldn't find any good person in this town.\" Both have a different way of looking at the world.\n\nOne cannot find anything bad in this world other cannot find anything good in this world. I right now have divided my world into good and bad because of my attachment, my desires, my aspirations of what I want to achieve. When I achieve that, great. When I don't achieve that, the world is falling apart. Bhagavan said, having known this knowledge, there will not be Ashubha in your life.",
      "reflection": "Krishna promises to reveal the \"most profound mysticism\" (guhyatamam) - knowledge combined with direct experience (jnana with vijnana) that liberates us from all that is inauspicious (ashubha). But this royal secret is only accessible to those who approach without caviling or carping (anasuya) - without petty objections or the desire to find fault. Today, examine your relationship with spiritual teachings: Do you approach them as a genuine seeker, or do you sometimes listen just to critique? The mind that seeks faults in the teaching never receives its nectar.\n\nThe chapter opens with a powerful reframe: what we label as \"good\" and \"bad\" (shubha and ashubha) are merely projections of our desires. Like the story of Yudhishthira who could find no bad person, and Duryodhana who could find no good person - each saw the world through the lens of their own nature. This week, when something \"bad\" happens, pause and ask: \"Is this truly ashubha, or have I simply labeled it so because it conflicts with what I want?\" Krishna says that knowing this knowledge removes all ashubha - not because circumstances change, but because our perception transforms.\n\nPractice exercise: Each morning, set an intention to receive the day's teachings - from people, situations, and challenges - without immediately judging them as favorable or unfavorable. Notice how much mental energy is freed when you stop sorting experiences into \"good for me\" and \"bad for me.\""

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter nine, Rajavidya Rajaguhya Yoga, the royal secret. In the royal knowledge, we have seen up to chapter eight in which we have learned about ourselves -- who we are in this limited self, what is our goal, and how we can evolve out of it. Then we ask, but what do we meditate upon? What do we evolve into? We have said you have to evolve from this limited self, identifying with this limited being, to the infinite self, unlimited being -- and that's you. Meditate upon whatever we want to achieve, we meditate on that.\n\nBut unless I know the nature of that infinite self and my relationship with it, how can I meditate upon it? So in chapter eight we have seen imperishable Brahman, that entity which remains in existence all the time. Even when I perish or this world will perish, that substratum which creates this reality will always be there. So now chapter nine says, what is my relationship with that imperishable Brahman? He is the source, he is the resting place. But what is my relationship with that?\n\nAnd so chapter nine says that is the royal secret. Right now I don't really see any relationship, even though I've heard through all these scriptures and books and religions. But I personally cannot feel any relationship with him. So what is my relationship? He said that is the royal secret.\n\nYou, knowing yourself, do not know what your relationship with yourself is. That is the deepest secret -- the most secret is that it's right there. Looking for my key all the time, and it's always in my pocket. That is the biggest secret. So that's the Raja Guhyam, and Raja Vidya.\n\nKnowing this -- knowing how to know this secret -- is the supreme knowledge. Once I realize my key is in my pocket that time I have the joy of my life. Up till now I was so worried about where is my key, I'm going to be late for my meeting and all of that. Suddenly I realized that right here, that is the greatest knowledge I can have at that moment. Anything else, you tell me at that time and say, well let me tell you. The E is equal to MC square.\n\nLook, I know I want my key. So when we get what we want to know is the supreme knowledge. So Bhagavan said, that's what I'm going to tell you in this chapter. So in the first three verses he gave the promise. And now he says, let me tell you what that secret is. So in verse four he says:\n\nMayatatam idam sarvam jagat avyaktamurtina. I am pervading this Jagat. This entire Jagat, this entire cosmos, this entire universe is pervaded by me in my unmanifest form. That which is illuminated is Jagat. That which is illuminated by my senses.\n\nMy Jagat is limited to that. That which I do not know is not part of my world. So Jagat is that which is illuminated by my senses. Your senses define your Jagat. Her senses define her Jagat. When you put everyone's Jagat together, that is the total Jagat.\n\nBhagavan said, I pervade this entire Jagat, whatever is illuminated by any being in this world. I pervade that in my unmanifest form. The manifest is something I can say, oh yeah, I have seen it, I have touched it, I have been there. But the unmanifest is something beyond my perception.\n\nSo Bhagavan said, this world of your perception is pervaded by me in my unmanifest form. Therefore you see the Jagat but do not see me, because I'm unmanifest. But I'm always there in anything you perceive, see, touch, or feel. Here is my nature: your entire Jagat is pervaded by me.\n\nIn my unmanifest form. That also includes myself -- I can perceive, feel, touch. But wait, if that's part of your Jagat, then I am pervading through that. In my unmanifest form. My mind -- I can feel my thoughts. Well then I am pervading in that also in my unmanifest form. My intellect.\n\nSo then I'm also pervading in the unmanifest form. Matsthani sarva bhutani. At least we understood that Bhagavan says he is in unmanifest form. Whatever you think of, right there, his presence is there. As long as I can consider something as part of my Jagat, Bhagavan is right there. So now I come to the conclusion:\n\nBhagavan resides in all of them. That's what all religions tell us. Bhagavan resides in you. The Lord resides in your heart. So you say, well, let's not get confused here. Okay, so what is my real nature?\n\nMatsthani, sarvabhutani, nacha aham te su avasthitaha. All these beings or things which you see, perceive, touch, and feel as your Jagat -- they reside in me, but I am not in them. See, in the first line he said that he pervades this entire Jagat of yours in his unmanifest form. We put two and two together and said, therefore he is in all of them. But no -- \"I am not in them, they are in me.\" My standard example: I buy a car and take it from Chesterfield County and bring it to Henrico County.\n\nWhat if Chesterfield County claims that the space in Mr. Batue's car was Chesterfield County space? \"Henrico County, you can't keep it there. Now you have extra space. Please return the extra space -- he took it with his car from Chesterfield County.\" Can I return that space in my car to Chesterfield County?\n\nWhat happened to the space which was in my car when the car was in Chesterfield County? It remained in Chesterfield County. When the car came to Henrico County, the space in the car changed from Chesterfield to Henrico. The car moved through the space. So the conundrum is: is the space in the car, or is the car in the space? Obviously, if I cannot return the space from Henrico to Chesterfield -- \"Oh, here is the extra space I brought with me\" -- then obviously the car was moving in the space, not the other way around. So now the space can say, \"All the cars are in me.\" But it also says, \"I am not in them.\" Now you have the puzzle -- there is no separate space \"in\" my car. So Bhagavan says, Matsthani Sarva Bhutani -- all the things and beings you can think of are in me.\n\nYour Jagat is whatever you can perceive, feel, think, and touch. Now everything I see, Bhagavan says he pervades in unmanifest form. In other words, he is not limited to your Jagat. If I only say that Bhagavan pervades the entire Jagat, I know the Jagat in manifest form, and Bhagavan is in unmanifest form.\n\nThe law of conservation says, in this world there is always the same amount of energy and matter. Whether it's in a form of a matter, form of energy. The total energy remains the same at any given time. So I can say, okay, the Bhagavan says he is unmanifest. So if I put sum it up, all the parts of my Jagat I know the Bhagavan. I say, no, they are in me, but I am not in them.\n\nI am something beyond that. So he said, what is that relationship then? So Swamiji explains here is that it's a relationship less relations. Just as the space in the car and the space outside. There's really no relationship to the car. It's not because the car is here.\n\nThere is a space here. The car will move, the space will move. With is my perception that the space is in the car. Space was always here outside this door. When I brought my car and parked it, I perceived that space is in my car. Space never moved from anywhere to anywhere.\n\nIn a similar way, the classical example we learn in Vedanta is that of a snake and a rope. The existence of snake is very real. Is part of my Jagat, my world. When I see a snake, I perceive it. I can vouch for it that there is a snake here. And therefore it is part of my Jagat.\n\nNow Bhagavan said, in unmanifest form, the rope was existing while I was seeing the snake in it. That snake could not have come into existence without the existence of the rope. So now the rope can say that I was always pervading through this entire snake in my unmanifest form while you were seeing the snake in me. Therefore the snake is in me. But I as the rope am not in the snake. The rope has no relationship to the snake whatsoever.\n\nSnake cannot exist without that rope. But it takes the support of my ignorance, my perception. My perception created snake in my Jagat in my world. Because Jagat is only limited by my perception. That which I can illumine as world of plurality is my Jagat. Snake was part of my Jagat.\n\nWithout the rope, the snake could not have existed. And therefore rope was existing in its unmanifest form in the snake all the time. But it was never in the snake. Bhagavan said, all these beings are existing in me. In other words, without my existence, there is no existence for anything. Therefore they are in me.\n\nBut I, in my pristine nature, unlimited, formless, was never in any of these shapes and forms and colors which you see. So the next verse takes it further -- in case you think we got it all. Nachamatsthani Bhutani, Pashya Me Yogam Aishvaram, Bhuta Bhrit Na Cha Bhutastho Mamatma Bhuta Bhavanaha. Now he says that all these beings exist in me because we have seen the snake exists in the rope. But the rope is not existing in the snake. So now you think okay, the beings are in him.\n\nBut then he adds: these beings are also not existing in me. The beings which I am perceiving, seeing, touching, and feeling are part of my Jagat. But the Brahman who is pervading all this Jagat has nothing to do with that. The snake which was existing in the rope -- the rope can say, \"It existed in me, but I am not in them.\" But now he goes further. If we think we got it correct and say, \"Okay, so the snake was always in the rope,\" he says, no -- Nachamatsthani Bhutani.\n\nEven though these beings are existing in me, there was never a time -- from the perspective of the one who knew the rope -- that the snake was existing in that rope. In my world there was a snake. But the next guy standing with his torchlight, who at least knew that it's a rope -- for him, there was no snake in his Jagat. The snake was only possible because of the rope, yet from his perspective, there was no snake ever in the rope.\n\nSo in reality, there is never a snake existing in the rope. The rope remained rope all the time -- before I created the snake in it and after I realized there is no snake. Therefore Bhagavan says: in your Jagat, you create this world through your perception. You create this world of plurality -- I exist, you exist, she exists, he exists.\n\nAnd now I said, I am the center of my universe. The world revolves around me. You are in the center of your universe and the world revolves around you. So from my perspective, in my Jagat, beings exist. Because the Supreme Being exist. And that being pervades through all the beings in my Jagat.",
      "reflection": "\"All beings dwell in Me, but I do not dwell in them\" (matsthani sarvabhutani na caham tesvavasthitah) - this paradox holds the key to understanding our relationship with the Divine. Like space that appears to be \"in\" a car but actually contains the car, we exist within the infinite consciousness, not the other way around. The space doesn't move when the car travels from one county to another - the car moves through unchanging space. Similarly, your true Self remains unchanging while the body-mind moves through experiences.\n\nThe analogy of the snake and rope illuminates this further: the snake (this world of multiplicity) cannot exist without the rope (Brahman), yet from the rope's perspective, no snake ever existed. Your limitations, your problems, your separate identity - these exist in the Divine like the snake exists in the rope. They are real to your perception but have no fundamental reality. This is the \"relationless relationship\" - we are intimately connected to the Divine (closer than close), yet the Divine remains untouched by our perceived limitations.\n\nContemplation for today: When you look at any object or person, remind yourself: \"This exists in consciousness, not consciousness in this.\" Notice how this shifts your sense of what is fundamental and what is derivative. Where you once saw solid, separate objects, begin to sense the unmanifest presence that pervades and supports all that you perceive."

      "commentary": "We have been discussing chapter nine, Rajavidya Raja Guhya Yoga. So far we have seen that Bhagavan has indicated the relationless relationship of Jiva, Jagat and Paramatma. That's basically the topic of this discussion that Bhagawan started. So we are aware of our relationship with the Jiva to the Jagat, that I consider myself to be independent of the Jagat, the world. So the world I consider is an object, something other than me. But we still do not have any inkling about what our relationship with the Paramatma is.\n\nThe all pervading being. So Bhagavan clarified in the first six verses that his relationship to the Jagat is a relationless relationship. First he said, I am not in them, they are in me. The first conception we have from our childhood, learning from other teachers and religions, is that Bhagavan is within me, but I do not know who that Bhagavan is. Bhagavan clarified that I am not in them, I am not in the beings. So the first paradigm shift here is Bhagavan saying I am not in them.\n\nThe next thing he says is that they are in me. I pervade this entire Jagat Jagat which I can imagine and perceive in its infinity. Bhagawan said I am that infinite Jagat and all beings are in the Jagat. I am not in it, but it is in me. So Brahman Paramatma is the fundamental. Everything is an emergent reality.\n\nThe Jagat is emerging out of Paramatma, Jiva is emerging out of Jagat. So he clarified this relationship that I am fundamental, Jagat and Jivas are within me. But then he clarifies further saying but in reality, even they are not in me. So first we are conceived as the wind in the space, that the space is all pervading and infinite. From our perspective, the wind is finite and moving around within the space. In the same way all other elements which we see below, space, air, fire, water, earth, they're within space.\n\nSo space is the substratum for all things and beings to be in. That's our normal perception. The space is all pervading. Everything is within the space. Now Bhagavan is saying that he is beyond space and time. The Jagat is bound by space and time.\n\nBhagavan says, I am beyond space and time. So the Bhagavan is fundamental, infinite, all pervading, unchanging. Jagat is bound by space and time. And therefore it is changing, but is constantly changing with time. So the conundrum is: if the Jagat and Jiva came out of Brahman, the supreme reality, how did Brahman change? I see the manifest Jagat -- the manifest Prakriti which came out of Brahman, which is unmanifest -- so how did the unmanifest become manifest? That is the riddle we have to solve. So Bhagavan said, even they are not in me. This makes it clear that the Jiva and Jagat are apparent reality, not the fundamental reality. They appear to be in me, but they are also actually not in me.\n\nAnd therefore we use this analogy of snake and rope. So that's the only way the two things can exist in the same state of manifest and unmanifest at the same time. Rope is unmanifest to the one who is afraid of snake. But someone who is aware of the rope, for him, the snake is not there. So these two are related, but have no real relationship. Snake and rope are related because without rope, the snake cannot exist.\n\nBut snake has no real reality other than the observer is creating this reality. You remove the observer, the snake and rope dichotomy goes away. So this Jagat and Jiva, which I see as two realities -- Bhagavan said that they do not really exist. They are created by my observations. It's my mind which projects space and time. Space and time are concepts of my mind.\n\nWhen I am not aware of myself, in deep sleep, neither space nor time exists. When you wake up, only then can you say, \"Nice sleep.\" But how long did I sleep? I will have no idea unless I look at the watch or clock. I went to sleep at such and such time, woke up at such and such time.\n\nSo I infer that I slept for as many hours. But a deep sleeper has no sense of time or space. So the Bhagavan said, jiva and Jagat are the conceptions of mind. But I, in reality is pristine without any change. But then Jeevan Jagat are very real for us. How do they come into existence?\n\nBhagawan now explains in the following verses. Sarvabhutani, Kaunteya, Prakritim, Yanti, Mamikam, Kalpakshaye, Punasthani, Kalpadau, Visrijami Aham. At the end of the Kalpa all beings, Sarva Bhutani, come back to my original nature, Prakriti. Prakriti we discussed in chapter seven is the fundamental manifest reality, also called Hiranyagarbha, also called Ishvara.\n\nSo Brahman with Maya is Ishvara. Brahman is the efficient cause. Maya is the material cause. Maya provides this material to create this Jagat. So this Maya is the fundamental Prakriti. From that fundamental Prakriti, the Prakriti which I see as pluralistic manifestation comes into existence.\n\nThis plurality goes back into that singular Prakriti at the end of Kalpa. We learned in last chapter that Brahmaji is one day is one Kalpa. Brahmaji is one day is 1000 Maha Yugas. One Mahayuga has four Yugas, Sathya, Treta, Dwapur and Kali. And we have calculated the one Kalpa is 4.3 billion years. So here Bhagavan says there is one cycle of creation.\n\nThe another cycle of dissolution is Brahmaj's night, which is equally as long as 4.3 billion years. The Bhagawan said, I create this Jagat at the beginning of my day and all that comes back to its original state at the end of the Kalpa. So the creation goes to the evolution as we perceive in our scientific observations. In our modern day, the universe came into existence, the Big Bang. It continues to expand, it continues to evolve, and at some point of time it will go back to its original state. Bhagavad said Sarvabhutani, all beings in this Jagat, Prakrutim, Yanthi, Mamikam, Kalpakshaya.\n\nAt the end of Kalpa they all come back to me in my Prakriti. Punahatani, Kalpada, Visrajami Aham. I recreate them at the beginning of the next Kalpa. This is very similar to our daily experience. During the day, I have all these ideas, all these goals, my to-do list. When I go to sleep, all those ideas are folded back into my consciousness. When I'm in deep sleep, I don't really feel anything.\n\nI have no to-do list, no idea what I need to become, what I need to acquire, what I already accomplished. All those ideas are in a dormant state when I'm sleeping. The next morning when I wake up, exactly those same ideas will create my new day. I went to sleep as an architect; I wake up as an architect. A doctor who went to sleep as a doctor wakes up as a doctor. My problems from yesterday, unresolved?\n\nThey're still unresolved today. So we start from where we left off last night. Bhagavan said here in the case of the Srishti, at the individual level, my world starts at the beginning of the day or ends when I go to sleep at night. At the Samasthi level. At the end of Kalpa, the whole world goes to sleep. But all those Vasanas tendencies of all the beings are in a dormant state.\n\nThe new Kalpa will start with the old Kalpa. So nothing really changes. When the new Kalpa starts, the same cycle will start all over again. And so Bhagavan said, Prakrutim swam Avastabhya Vishrujami Puna Puna. This is unending cycle. The Brahmaji wakes up one day and then goes to sleep.\n\nAnd then we are done with it. Brahmaji's life is considered a hundred years. One day and one night make up two Kalpas. Now multiply that by his hundred years. That Brahma then gets liberation, Moksha. The new Brahma takes over.\n\nThe new cycle starts all over again. So this is unending creation. My world comes out of my ideas and it dissolves into my nothingness. When I go to deep sleep, when I wake up, it starts all over again. This happens all throughout my life. When I die, everything gets merged into tendencies.\n\nI will have no memory of my experiences, but I'll carry that fragrance with me of what I have experienced in this life, which will be the beginning of my next life. At an individual level and at Brahma's level, the entire Srushti is in that state. Bhagavan said, you can visualize this entire Jagat as your own self, just as you're visualizing yourself right now as a limited being. Bhuta Gramam Imam Kritsnam Avasam Prakriteh Vashat.\n\nThis cycle continues perpetually, because Brahman is beyond time. Time does not exist for Brahman. Time exists because we are perceiving events in space. Time is an interval between two events. If you remove all events, there is no time.\n\nIf I don't experience anything, there is no time. But I experience one event, then a second event -- this interval becomes time. This Bhuta Gramam Kritsnam, this entire group of beings, Avasham, without any choice -- as long as I have a tendency, I'm going to manifest that tendency. If I have desire, I'll act according to that desire. Visrijami Punah Punah, Avasam Prakriteh Vashat.\n\nBecause they are under the spell of Prakriti, the Maya. Therefore they do not have any choice but to act according to their own tendencies and vasanas. All beings are propelled to act according to their swadharma, according to their makeup of their own vasanas and desires. Even when they go into dormant state, those vasanas and desires remain in dormant state. When you wake up, those vasanas and desires come back again. And this cycle continues perpetually unless you get out of this cycle of becoming and doing.\n\nNow the question Bhagavan answers here is: does that affect Brahman? Because he is the propeller, the prompter, the supporter of all this activity which is happening perpetually. Creation and dissolution are continuing. They cannot happen without the presence of Brahman. My day, my night, and my activity cannot happen unless I'm conscious of it.\n\nAs long as my consciousness is there, there will be a waking state for me, a dream state for me, a deep sleep state for me. The question is: is my consciousness getting affected by my experiences at an individual level? At the Samashti level, does Brahman get affected by these happenings? Bhagavan clarifies in this verse: Na Cha Mam Tani Karmani Nibadhnanti.\n\nThese actions of creation and dissolution which is only possible because I, the Supreme Consciousness is supporting it by using Maya. But the Maya is Brahma Shraya. It is supported by Brahman. There is no magician. You have to have magician to create magic. So that magic is supported by magician.\n\nThis Maya is supported by Brahman. But Brahman uses that Maya as the material to create this Jagat. Just as in my dream state, I create the experiences of my waking state as the material to create my dreams. No matter how weird a dream is, it is never based on something which you have not experienced before. It may be jumbled up of all the experiences. But all my dreams are based on my experiences, not on anybody else's experiences.\n\nSo Brahman creating this Maya as the material, creating this Jagat and then dissolving this Jagat into Prakriti again remain in its pristine state, unaffected by individual actions.",
      "reflection": "Krishna describes cosmic cycles - at the end of each Kalpa (4.3 billion years), all beings return to Prakriti, and at the beginning of the next, they are sent forth again. This mirrors our daily experience: each night when you enter deep sleep, your entire world - your to-do list, your achievements, your worries - dissolves into dormant consciousness. Each morning, you wake up exactly where you left off. The architect who sleeps wakes as an architect; your unresolved problems remain unresolved. Understanding this cycle reveals something profound: nothing is truly lost or gained; everything is a manifestation from and dissolution back into the same source.\n\nThe crucial teaching in verse 9 is: \"These actions do not bind Me\" (na ca mam tani karmani nibadhnanti). Though Brahman is the support of all cosmic activity - creation, preservation, dissolution - it remains utterly unaffected, like the dreamer who creates an entire dream world yet wakes unchanged. Your consciousness similarly witnesses all your experiences - joy and sorrow, success and failure - without being touched by any of it. The witness is never the witnessed.\n\nDaily practice: Tonight, before sleep, consciously notice how your entire world - relationships, responsibilities, identity - dissolves as you drift off. In the morning, observe how it all reconstructs. Ask yourself: \"What remains constant through this daily creation and dissolution?\" That unchanging awareness is your true nature, unbound by the cosmic dance of manifestation."

      "commentary": "We have been discussing chapter nine and what we have learned is that Bhagavan said, I am the source of all the things, all the beings, everything that you see. I am the source and I am also the final resting place for all things. Things come out of me and they will return back into me. There is nothing really that can exist without me. As we said in that classical example, a ghost cannot exist without the post. So from the post's point of view, the post can say the ghost came out of me. And once you realize there is no ghost, it also goes back into me.\n\nAt any given time the ghost has no modifications or it never changed into ghost. But my ignorance and my perception has created this perception of a ghost. In a similar way, Bhagavan says from me the whole Prakriti comes into existence. This world of plurality as you see, is because of my existence. If I'm not there, there is no world of plurality. This world as we know is I.\n\nAnd the world only exists because the fundamental basic reality is the self. I know I exist because of myself. You know you exist because of yourself. She knows she exists because of herself. But we think these are different selves. Bhagavan says it's just me, myself reflecting through all of them.\n\nBut we don't recognize it because of Mogha Asha -- vain desires. I think I am the center of my universe. The world needs to revolve around my desires. I want things to be like this, I want the world to be like this, I want the market to do this when I invest. And therefore we do the wrong actions.\n\nBecause I have now considered this limited being as me, I now have my false desires. We know we have very little power over how things work in this world. But when we act, we forget what we know. Even buying a gallon of milk -- so many people do so many things to bring that gallon of milk to your nearest Martin's or Food Lion. Then, and only then, can you go and buy it. But I think that if I have $4 in my pocket, I'm the king and can buy that milk. That Mogha Asha creates this false notion that I am in control.\n\nAnd Bhagavan says Mogha Jnana Vichetasaha -- because of this false knowledge that \"this is me and I can change this world as I want,\" we create a false notion of control. Rakshasim Asuram Chaiva -- these people are of the nature of Rakshasa and Asura. Rakshasa is one who is predominated by the Rajasic nature. We have seen in Vedanta that nothing can exist in this world of time and space if it does not have these three qualities of Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas -- the fundamental classifications of the basic gunas.\n\nFor any effect to exist in time and space, you need Sattva, which is the awareness that this exists. Then there is the activity -- the intense activity we see at the atomic level, subatomic level, or even at the level of our daily experience. And then Tamas, the inertia for the thing to remain in its state as long as it can, until another force changes it. He said that those with the most Rajasic predominance are the Rakshasas, because they consider that their activity will give them control over their world. And the Asuras are the Tamasic ones, with the predominant quality of Tamas. They rely on inertia.\n\nIf I don't do anything, things won't change. Let's keep things as is, don't change it. Not realizing that the nature of this world is Samsara -- constantly changing. In that Samsara, I try to keep things inert, as is. That is the nature of the Asura. These two qualities make us forget the real nature of the self.\n\nIn contrast to that -- Mahatmanastumam Partha, Devim Prakritim Ashritaha. There is another group of people who do not fall into these two categories of Rajasic and Tamasic. The Rajasic and Tamasic are constantly interested only in material existence. They see their physical existence and say, \"My goal in life is to maintain this existence and have as much pleasure from this world as possible\" -- not realizing that this is a temporary existence in time and space. But my real existence is infinite, permanent, immutable -- in the nature of the self.\n\nThe other group of people, the Mahatmas, are great souls simply because they realize the nature of the self. Mahatmanastumam Partha, Devim Prakritim Ashritaha -- because they have taken refuge in the divine nature of the self, which is to recognize Sattva, the truth, that eternal truth which does not change with time. Everything in this world is relative truth. Somebody says, \"What is it?\" I say, \"It's a day outside.\"\n\nWell, that's a relative truth. It was not true at 4 o'clock in the morning. It will not be true at 8 o'clock at night. It is true only now in this time. So it's called a relative truth. But the truth which remains constant in any period of time is called Sattva, which I can say it was this 150 years ago.\n\nIt is now and it will be for eternity. That's the universal truth, the Sattva. Those who take taken refuge into this awareness of that immutable truth which is the nature of the self. My self is not this limited being which has started its life on day one time. When I was born and I'll die is time T2. And I want to make the most out of this life.\n\nBetween this span of T1 and T2 are those Asuras and Rakshasas. But one who says, \"This is just a flicker in my existence. My existence was infinite before and will be infinite after. I want to achieve that sense back, not get bogged down with this limited being\" -- those are the great souls. They identify not with the limited self, but with the higher self. Here is the example I have used many times, because I'm an architect.\n\nThe space in this room is a conditioned space. Right now my association with this space is room space conditioned by these walls, floor, and ceiling. But I also recognize that this space is universal space. It is here and it will be here, whether this building is there or not. The one who recognizes that myself will always be here, whether his body is there, mind is there, or intellect is there or not.\n\nThey are the great souls. Therefore they have taken refuge in the Daivi Prakriti -- this Sattva, predominantly Sattvic in nature. They recognize the ultimate truth about their own self. Bhajanti ananya manasaha. Therefore they devote themselves to me with a single-pointed mind.\n\nNow obviously there are word connotations that come from our own experience in life. Bhajanti -- with that kirtan and all that, you know. Bhajanti ananya manasaha, satatam. So constantly they are doing this. But that's not possible in the literal sense. But we know that the Vedantic connotation of the word bhajanti means love. Love for the Divine is devotion. Love is nothing but identification.\n\nThe more I identify with someone, the more my love increases. The more I identify with the Divine. So ananya manasaha means without any other thought -- without any other thought that this limited being is me. I'm not an architect, I'm not a father, I'm not a son. All these are superimpositions on me.\n\nAmitabh Bachchan never forgets when he plays the coolie that he is Amitabh Bachchan. He never forgets while doing all these roles he plays. I too play all these roles, but I forget and get identified with them. And I get carried away with them.\n\nThe Mahatma never gets carried away. So bhajantim Ananya Manasaha Gnatva Bhut adim avyam. Knowing that I am the source of all the beings imperishable. We typically see that the source get destroyed into you take a seed and seed becomes a tree. The seed is no more there. Now I can say, okay, now I want the seed back.\n\nThat's a perishable source of the tree. Bhagavan said, but I am the source of this universe. All the being but imperishable never get destroyed. Because the creation is a Maya Post never became ghost. Therefore it never had to go into any transformation into something else. So once you see the ghost, post doesn't go away.\n\nIt remains exactly what it was before. Bhagavan says, knowing that I am the immutable, imperishable source of all the beings. These Mahatmas wants to get back to their original self. At the immutable, imperishable self. They drop the identification with the limited. Playing this part very efficiently in this world.\n\nBut always the identification is with the higher self. Just as Amitabh Bachchan never forgets in Amitabh Bachchan. But he is a coolie at the time. You know, say, Satatam Kirtayantah maam Yatan taschadiravratah. So now what will be my attitude once I have recognized that this limited being is not me. This life is just a part I am playing for the time being.\n\nBefore I was born, I existed as the universal being. After that all existed as a universal being. Before this building was built, this space was here. And I can vouch for it because I live here long enough. Long before this building was here, this space was here. After the building is built, there's room spaces here.\n\nAnd someday somebody will decide we can do better use of this land. And the building will be gone, but the space will be here. I am here, I was here and I will be here. That's the eternal truth. Bhagavan says Satatam Kirtayantah. Having known this, so what will be my actions?\n\nSatatam constantly Kirtayantaha. I am singing the glory of that eternal self that I am my Lord, who functions through me as this limited being. Swamiji obviously said kirtan du Visival. We have a bhajan, you know, next week. So that's the kirtan. That's the only time we do kirtan Bhajan and kirtan Swamiji.\n\nThis singing, with equally crude and noisy instruments -- it has its own place, for that time only, to occupy the mind. Because at least at that time, my mind is focused on those songs and the verses and what they mean. At that time, I'm not thinking of anything else. Those who do any kind of art know this -- the mind has to be occupied with something.\n\nAnd if it doesn't occupy, then it wanders away. One whose mind is constantly attached to that understanding that I am not this limited self, this universal self is manifesting in this world. There is nothing that can exist in this world without Him. And therefore there is no existence for anything else other than that. If God is all pervading, where are we? If we are here, then he is limited.\n\nHe cannot be all pervading. So if he is all pervading, there is no place for anyone else. All that I see is nothing but his manifestations. So now that constantly when I see anything in this world, the thought at the back of my mind says, that is nothing but the Lord's manifestation. Whether that is good, bad or ugly. See, we have no problem.\n\nWe see something very beautiful, nice, and divine -- \"That's God's manifestation.\" Early morning the sun rises and we see, \"O God!\" But when we see darkness and evil and still see his presence in it -- that's where the real test is. Then my Kirtan, Bhagavan says, is complete, no matter what I encounter.\n\nI know he pervades the entire universe and all its happenings. Nothing other than him can exist, and therefore there cannot be anything other than Him.",
      "reflection": "\"Fools disregard Me, seeing Me clad in human form\" (avajnanti mam mudha manusim tanum asritam). The Divine pervades everything, yet we fail to recognize it because we expect something extraordinary. We look for God in temples and sacred texts while ignoring the consciousness that animates every being we meet. The Divine is not hiding - it is the most obvious reality, present in every eye that sees, every heart that beats. Our failure to perceive it comes from looking for the wrong thing in the wrong way.\n\nThose caught in Mogasha (vain desires), Moghakarma (vain actions), and Moghajnana (vain knowledge) live as if they are the center of the universe, believing their limited efforts can secure lasting happiness. Dominated by Rajasic (restless activity) and Tamasic (inertia) tendencies, they remain blind to the Sattvic truth of their own divine nature. The Rakshasa nature says \"I will acquire and control,\" the Asura nature says \"I will resist all change\" - both miss the recognition that the Self is already complete.\n\nSelf-inquiry for this week: Examine your primary operating mode. Are you driven by endless activity toward acquisition (Rajasic)? Or by resistance and avoidance (Tamasic)? Neither brings lasting peace. The alternative is to cultivate Sattva - the quality of awareness that recognizes the Divine presence in all. Today, practice seeing the same consciousness looking out from every pair of eyes you encounter. What shifts when you recognize that the one perceiving through you is perceiving through all?"

      "commentary": "We have been discussing chapter nine, Rajavidy Rajagohya Yoga. Yoga of Supreme Knowledge and Supreme Secret. So far we have seen the Bhagavan has revealed the supreme secret that I pervade everything in this Jagat. And this Jagat is supported by my Maya, my association with Prakruti. Prakruti produces all that is moving and unmoving. But I am not in the Prakriti.\n\nI am not in the beings in the Prakriti. Those beings are in me. I am not in the Jagat, but Jagat is in me. In other words, my self supports the perception of the Jagat. So the Jagat exists as long as I perceive it. This world exists for me as long as I am conscious of it.\n\nWhen I'm not conscious of this Jagat, then this Jagat does not exist for me. The same way from the Supreme Consciousness. As long as that Supreme Consciousness is aware of the Jagat, that Jagat exists. And therefore Bhagavan says that I am not in the Jagat, Jagat is in me. But then he also said that they are also not in me. The beings and things in this Jagat are also not in me.\n\nIn other words, the Jagat and the things and beings which I see in the Prakriti, they are not in the consciousness. The consciousness is not affected by this perceptions of the world outside. So Bhagawan created contradictory statements for us to understand. Relationless relationship with Bhagavan. We are related to Bhagavan, as close to him as we are to our own selves. Because this world is created out of Bhagavan's own self.\n\nTherefore I cannot be further away from him than I am from my own self. And that's the secret which is the Supreme Secret. Even though I am as close to him as I am to my own self. But I never feel his presence. So Bhagawan said, to feel my presence you have to identify with me. People who do not identify with me.\n\nBhagawan is explaining in last verse, 12 he says Moga Asa, Mogha Karmanaha, Moga Gnana Vicheta sah. This is the reason why we are not experiencing his presence. Because we are distracted by our vain desires. Those desires prompt us to do vain actions. Because of our vain knowledge who we are, we consider this body, this mind, this intellect is to be me, this limited being to be me. I'm driven by my Rajasic and Tamasic tendencies.\n\nAs we have seen, this Maya is the root cause of the production of this Jagat. Jagat comes into existence out of Maya. Maya has three qualities. Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. Therefore everything in this Prakriti. Prakriti is nothing but the representation of Maya to us.\n\nSo everything in this Prakriti has those three qualities, Satvarajas and Dhammas. Awareness, activity and inertia. To exist in space and time, it has to have activity and inertia. And Sattva is the awareness part of it. So everything in this Jagat has these three qualities. The permutation combination of these three qualities makes this plurality that we see like in a three color printing.\n\nThere are only three colors, but they create myriads of shades of color. We can create all kinds of pictures from the combination of those three colors. The same way, this Prakriti produces a variety of things and beings by permutation and combination of these three Gunas.\n\nBhagavan said that up to the level of human beings, people are just living by their instincts. All animals, plants, and aquatic life survive in the lap of Mother Nature.\n\nThey are aware of their own existence. But they are not aware of any other higher entity. Human beings are the only ones who have intellect. To realize that there got to be somebody higher than me, somebody greater than me to have the control over this world. Having that understanding, I still don't identify with him, because Rajas and Tamas dominate.\n\nWhen Sattva is subdued by Rajas and Tamas, all my actions will be driven by those Rajasic and Tamasic tendencies. The Rajasic and Tamasic tendencies tell me that my happiness lies in this world out there. Therefore all my efforts to achieve that happiness which is my true nature. Just like water seeks its own nature, happiness is our true nature. So we constantly seek bliss and happiness.\n\nAnd therefore we work in the world outside. We never complain about why I'm feeling good today. We always complain I'm not feeling good. Today because being good is my nature, being not feeling good is not my nature. Bhagavan said, you are not recognizing your nature because of your wrong knowledge about yourself. Mogha Gnana -- because of wrong knowledge, Vichetasaha -- my thinking is wrong about where my happiness lies.\n\nI'm working outside in a Rajasic manner to acquire things, to achieve things, to get happiness. Or I say, \"If I don't do anything, then I'll be happy\" -- that's the Tamasic tendency. Because of these two aspects of my nature, which are predominantly Rajasic and Tamasic, I'm not identifying with him. Bhagavan said that when he takes the human form, people do not recognize him and they avoid him, ignore him. We know everything about our own self and other beings, but we don't know about the divinity which is common in all of us -- the consciousness which is the common factor, the one thread which ties everything together in this universe.\n\nSo therefore Bhagavan says Rakshasim Asuram Chaiva Prakritim Mohinim Shritaha -- by the nature of this Rajasic and Tamasic Prakriti, they are confused about their own self and about the divinity in all human beings.\n\nIn contrast, Mahatmanastumam Partha Devim Prakritim Ashritaha. In this path of evolution, everything evolves from Tamas to Sattva. Even in the evolution of our planet, we can see that first there was nothing but just inert matter.\n\nThen came the organic life. Then gradually it evolved into more complex life, more intelligent life. So everything evolves from inertia to knowledge, from Tamas to Sattva. Some are in the path of evolution at Tamasic level, but they are on the path of their own evolution. So next step is Rajas to be Rajasic. So in our self unfoldment, Swamiji says that when you introspect and see what you find, if you find Tamasic quality, then replace it by Rajasic quality.\n\nIf you find Rajasic tendencies, replace them by Sattvic tendencies. So this is a conscious effort. As a human being, we have our freedom to choose how to behave. So Bhagavan said, those Mahatmas who have evolved to Sattva, even Mahatma has Rajasic and Tamasic tendencies. But they're subdued by Sattvic tendencies. In other cases, the Rajasic tendencies are subduing the Sattvic tendency.\n\nHere the Sattvic tendencies are subduing the Rajasic and Tamasic tendencies. Devim Prakritim Ashritaha -- the Sattvic is considered the Devi, the divine quality, closer to reality. Bhajantim Ananya Manasaha -- knowing fully well that I am not this bundle of matter, not this mind, not this intellect. Even though I'm pulled by the tendencies of body, mind, and intellect.\n\nI'm constantly reminding myself I'm part of this all pervading consciousness. My consciousness is same as consciousness in all other being. Bhajanti Ananya Manasa not having any other thought. Even though I'm functioning in the world like everybody else. But that thought is constant in my mind that I am the divine being at the core of my being. I am that supreme self, the all pervading consciousness.\n\nKnowing that Gnatva Bhuta dim avyam I am part of that immutable self which is all pervading. So we have discussed this example before. The space in my car or my car is in this space. The car is in the space. Space is not in the car. The space seems divided in different cars in different rooms.\n\nBut it is not really divided. Otherwise the car cannot move in the space -- it would have Henrico space when it is in Henrico, Hanover space when it's in Hanover County. Gnatva Bhutadim Avyayam -- the self in me and the self in you are not two divided selves. The self in all beings is one.\n\nThe consciousness which makes the entire Jagat possible is undivided. It's not that my consciousness is different than your consciousness. Your equipment, my equipment are different. And therefore our manifest representations are different. So Bhagavan says Mahatma. One who has evolved to that level of understanding that the self is undivided and all beings are existing in that consciousness.\n\nBhajanti Ananyamanah he devotes himself to me without any other thought, constantly with a single pointed devotion. There is no other doubt. There is no other identification. Even though he realizes that he is an individual functioning as this body, mind, intellect. But that is only possible because the consciousness functioning. We know this body is inert because we have seen dead bodies.\n\nDead body cannot function when the consciousness is not there. Therefore we come to the conclusion that the body is inert. Body is nothing but made up of food which I have eaten all my life. But I am a conscious being. Therefore my real identity is the consciousness and not this body. This Mahatma has come to this level of understanding.\n\nTherefore he is constantly devoting himself to that true self which is the consciousness. Satatam, Kirta, Yanthamam, Yatantaschadravrataha. He is constantly doing kirtan to me. He is constantly praising me. So we obviously kirtan, bhajan, kirtan. We hear these words in our day to day conversation.\n\nIn our culture, bhajan is when we are thinking about the Lord; kirtan is when we are praising the Lord. But here, the praise and thinking about the Lord carry a very different connotation. When I am praising the Lord, I am devoted to the Lord. Devotion is love for the Divine. Our love for the Divine becomes devotion, and love is nothing but identification. When I identify with something or someone, I love that thing or that person. I love my BMW because I identify with my BMW. When I identify with the Lord as my Lord, then I devote myself to Him. This devotion is nothing but my identification with the Lord. And therefore that kirtan -- kirtan is not that one Sunday afternoon or Saturday evening we get together, and Swamiji says, the noisy kirtan we do with equally noisy equipment.\n\nKirtan is a constant thought in my mind that I am not this limited being, and my Lord is not divided into separate beings. We all exist in his own being. We are only existing because he exists. I am only alive because the consciousness is functioning through me. When the consciousness will not be there, I will be purely as just a bundle of matter. They will call it dead body and get rid of it as quickly as possible.\n\nSatatam Yatantascha Dridavrataha. They are constantly striving, because they will be pulled by this Prakriti to identify with it -- to identify with my body, to go out and get things, to fall in love with things and beings outside. I have to constantly remind myself; therefore it's Yatantaha.\n\nSo once you get this knowledge from the books or from a guru, you're not done with it. That's just the beginning. Now you have to constantly remember it with everything you do. Constant efforts are required for even Mahatmas. Dridavrataha -- they are steadfastly established in this knowledge. There is never a doubt that this is not true.\n\nSome of us read this, then read another book, and start doubting whether this is right or that is right. One says there is Ishvara; another says there is no Ishvara. One path says there is no life after death.",
      "reflection": "The Mahatmas (great souls) are distinguished not by external achievements but by their inner orientation. They have taken refuge in the Daivi Prakriti - the divine nature of Sattva, truth, and awareness. While functioning in the world like everyone else, they maintain unwavering recognition that their true identity is not the body-mind but the all-pervading consciousness. Like the actor Amitabh Bachchan who never forgets he is Amitabh while playing a coolie, the Mahatma never loses awareness of the Self while playing worldly roles.\n\n\"Bhajanti ananya manasah\" - they worship with single-pointed mind, with no other thought. This is not about excluding worldly duties, but about the constant background awareness that \"I am the divine being at the core of my existence.\" Such devotion is identification - the more you identify with something, the more you love it. The Mahatma identifies with the imperishable Self (bhutadim avyayam) that is the same in all beings. Just as the space in your car is not separate from space everywhere, consciousness in you is not separate from universal consciousness.\n\nKrishna describes three approaches to this truth: seeing the Divine as One (ekatvena - Advaita), as separate Creator and creation (prthaktvena - Dvaita), or as present everywhere with many faces (bahudha vishvatomukham). Whatever your philosophical approach, if your goal is alignment with the Supreme, you will reach it. Practice this week: Whatever draws you spiritually - prayer, meditation, service, study - pursue it with drdha-vrata (firm resolve). The path matters less than the steadfastness with which you walk it."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter nine, Raja Vidya, Raja Guhya Yoga -- Yoga of King of Secrets and King of Knowledge. So from chapters one through six we have seen who I am and how I should work in this world with the Spirit of Yajna. Because those actions are not binding. All others are binding. Then we have looked in chapter seven, the lower nature of the supreme, that which is manifest all around me. And then in chapter eight we have seen his higher nature which is unmanifest, supporting all the beings.\n\nThe secret still is what is my relationship with him is the secret. Having known all that, I still cannot find how I can relate to Him. So now chapter nine gives us the indication of what is your relationship with the Supreme? The Bhagavan, the Almighty, my Creator. So in the beginning he said that my relationship to this Prakriti which you are part of it. I'm trying to find out my relationship with Him.\n\nI already learned in chapter 8 that I'm nothing but a part of this manifest world. Therefore I'm nothing but a Prakriti. See, my relationship to this manifest world, Bhagavan said, is that of a relationship less relation. So he said that this entire Jagat of moving and unmoving is pervaded by me and presided by me, Adiyakshaina. I keep eye on it, but I don't take part in it. This Jagat is in me, but I'm not in them.\n\nThey are also not in. From my perspective, from the perspective of the supreme, this Jagat does not exist and therefore it is not in me. So therefore he says, this relationship of this Prakriti and the supreme is that of no relationship but a perceived relationship. Relationship which can be associated with each other but have no real association. This entire Jagat is pervaded by me and Chara Nachar, moving and unmoving. I send them forth by my Yoga Maya.\n\nAt the beginning of the cycle I send those multitude of beings. Same multitude of beings will merge into me at the end of the cycle. And again they will start all over again. Those who do not recognize this fact because of their limited understanding of the nature of the supreme, they try to find the perfection which truly belongs to the supreme through Mogasa, Moga Karma. By the vain desires and vain actions. I'm trying to achieve something which can only be achieved at the level of perfection.\n\nI'm trying to achieve it with my little efforts here and there. Bhagavan says, therefore they cannot achieve it. But then there are others who recognize this fact that if my goal is that high, then I have to align myself with that high of an entity. The one who truly have these qualities. How do you do strategic planning? You align your capabilities with the opportunities.\n\nWhen you combine the two, that's your strategy. But if I don't have capabilities and I just keep looking at opportunities, that's not really a strategy. My strategy in life is to get perfect happiness. I see opportunity there -- there's got to be somewhere, a state where I can be happy all the time. What I miss out on is: am I capable? So I am not really aligning these two. I have two different entities -- one who is very limited in capability, trying to achieve something which is highly unachievable through limited means. Bhagavan said that those who recognize this align themselves with the supreme. They focus single-pointedly to identify themselves with that supreme who is pervading everywhere.\n\nAnd to do that, they use different methods. Different people use different methods. Once they recognize the fact that the perfect happiness is not achievable by actions in this world of Prakriti -- the world of objects, emotions and thoughts as shown in Swamiji's BMI chart -- this world can never give you the perfect happiness, no matter how hard you try. They align with the supreme, the work in this world. But their goal is aligned with the Mahatmas. Those great souls who realize that perfect happiness can only be found by aligning with one who is perfect. They achieve that in many different ways.\n\nSome consider him to be only one -- the one that exists and nothing else can exist. And as we have seen in our three schools of thought, that's Advaita. I and him are no different from each other. I am under the spell of Maya. That's the only difference.\n\nSome see it as divided into many. So at least it's more than one -- Creator and creation. These two, some believe, will never be able to coincide with each other. Creation will always remain creation, Creator will always remain Creator.\n\nFrom that perspective also people can reach Him. Or I say bahudha vishvatomukham. He is everywhere, in everything I see. And every being I see is him alone. Every eye I see, every leg I see, every mouth I see -- it's all his expressions. Others see it that way, as we have seen in Vishishtadvaita.\n\nHe is the whole and what I see is just a part. I have a narrow perspective on life. Therefore I cannot see him in his complete glory. But wherever I see, I see his glimpse. That's Visheshta Advaita. So Bhagavan said, any which way you can approach me, it is all coming to me only.\n\nBecause I am everything. If you pay money to Chinmaya Mission, whether at this center or any other center, eventually it all goes to Chinmaya Mission. It really doesn't matter. Any efforts you put in aligning yourself with the supreme, in whatever manner -- whether it's Advaita, Dvaita, or Vishishtadvaita -- seeing him as father, mother, brother, supporter.\n\nAnd therefore they will be successful as long as they align with me in any which way. Because that's all coming to me. Because I am the father of this entire Jagat -- Mata Dhata Pitamaha. As we have said, I am also mother, sustainer, grandfather. Vedyam, Pavitram, Omkaram. I am that which is indicated in the Vedas as the supreme reality, as Om, which encompasses all four states of existence.\n\nThree which I am very aware which is my dream world, deep sleep and waking world. In the fourth one which supports all these three, he said that's indicated by Om. Therefore whatever is indicated in the Rukh Saam and Yajuho in these books of knowledge about his nature. Any which way you approach me is acceptable. You will reach me as long as your goal is to reach me. Gatihi Bharata Prabhuhu Sakshi Nivasah Bhagawan Vidyas uses the approach sometimes.\n\nI tell our young architects: it has to be idiot-proof. Consider your contractor the greatest fool on this planet, and then do your documents. That way you will not make the mistake of him misunderstanding you. Make it so clear, so obvious that you hit the lowest denominator. Bhagavan through Vedavyasa doesn't want to leave anything out. In case you missed it in Pitahamasya Jagato Mata Dhata -- now he adds Gatihi.\n\nI am the goal Bharata. I am the supporter Prabhu. I am the Lord Saksihi. Anything that is happening in this world, I am the witness. You may think that when you are doing something bad, nobody is seeing. But Bhagavan is watching that.\n\nBecause Bhagavan is every including your own self. It means you will know what you have done. Therefore I am always witness as you. I am the refuge when I am in trouble. I'm actually invoking my own capacity to overcome my difficulties. We have talked about many times.\n\nFriend is a very special relationship. In any other relationship, I have to be correct in my behavior and approach for that relationship to work. But friends? Any which way we meet after a long time, they curse each other and do all the funny things, hit each other. A friend is one who supports you no matter how wrong you are.\n\nAnytime I want to do something and I tell my friend Deepak, \"I'm trying to do this,\" he says, \"That's not a good idea.\" I say, \"No, but that will be fun in the end.\" He says, \"Okay, then if you really want to do it, let's go and do it.\" Just before exams, we did this all the time. I'd say, \"Deepak, let's go see a movie.\" He'd say, \"But tomorrow you have an exam.\" I'd say, \"I think I can make it up.\" And in the end he would say, \"Okay, then let's go.\" A friend will support you even when you are wrong, even if he knows you are going down the wrong path and going to suffer through it. Bhagavan says, \"I am that friend. Anytime you do something wrong, I know.\"\n\nI am telling you as your conscience. Still you want to do it? I am the beginning and the end. Sthanam -- also the place where you exist, the support. For anything to exist in space and time, you need inertia.\n\nBhagavan says, I am the Sthanam, that space where you exist. I'm also the treasure house. When I need knowledge -- O Bhagavan, O Saraswati Mata, Saraswati Puja. I want wealth -- Lakshmi Mata. I am afraid -- Hanuman Ji or Durga Mata. Whatever you want.\n\nI am the treasure house of anything you want. We have discussed this concept before. I am the source, the seed. But very different than any other source which we know. Every other source will be depleted once you exercise it. That source will be depleted.\n\nThat's why worried about this. Fossil fuel will be depleted or any seed. Once you use that seed and the tree comes out, the seed is destroyed. Immutable seed, the tree will come out or whatever the product. I still remain intact. Therefore any method which you apply is still coming to me.\n\nI am the one who bakes you as the sun. Aham Varsam, I rain down as rains. Nigruhani Utsradami I also hold and I also throw you out. I send you back Amrutham Chaya. None of us will ever have any experience of not existing. Not a single being has ever existed in this universe who has the experience of not existing.\n\nWe assume we will not exist because Gandhiji is not here, my father is not here. So it's an assumed position that I will not exist. However, you can't find one person in the entire history of the human race who can say, \"Yeah, I know what it means to not exist.\" Because everyone is only there when they think they are existing. Amritam -- immortality. Cha Eva Mrityustra -- and also death.\n\nThe death which I see decaying every day. Death and decay which I see. I as a baby have died and become a toddler. Toddler died and became a boy. And boy died, became a young man. A young man died into the old man.\n\nAnd now I think my next stage is not existing. I'm constantly seeing death. Bhagawan says that's also me. Sat, Asatya Aham Arjuna. O Arjuna in the head and Sat, that which is existing as real and also Asat that which is unreal. So Sat can be viewed in many different ways.\n\nThat which is temporary is Asat. That which is permanent is Sat. That which is cause is Sat. That which we see as effect is Asat. Everything in this world is nothing but an effect of a cause. The cause remains intact throughout all the variations and modifications of the effect. Standard examples we have seen are that of gold and gold bangles. I also use the example of space: space is Sat; all conditioned spaces -- room space, cathedral space, casino space -- are Asat.",
      "reflection": "In these verses, Krishna declares: \"I am the ritual, the sacrifice, the offering, the fire, and the act of offering\" (aham kratur aham yajnah). He is not just one element of worship - He is every element. This reveals a profound truth: in any spiritual practice, the worshipper, the worshipped, and the act of worship are all expressions of the same reality. There is no separation between subject, object, and action. When you offer a prayer, who is praying to whom? The consciousness in you reaches toward... consciousness itself.\n\n\"I am the Father, Mother, Grandfather, Sustainer of the universe\" (pitaham asya jagato mata dhata pitamahah). Whatever role you seek the Divine in, that role is fulfilled. \"I am the Goal, the Supporter, the Lord, the Witness, the Abode, the Refuge, the Friend\" (gatir bharta prabhuh sakshi nivasah saranam suhrt). Notice especially \"suhrt\" - the friend. A friend supports you even when you are wrong, unlike other relationships that demand correct behavior. The Divine is that friend who accompanies you through every mistake, never abandoning you.\n\nMost remarkably, Krishna says: \"I am the imperishable seed\" (bijam avyayam). Unlike ordinary seeds that are destroyed when they sprout, the Divine remains unchanged though the entire universe emerges from it. This week, contemplate: What remains unchanged through all your life's transformations - childhood to adulthood, joy to sorrow, health to illness? That unchanging witness-awareness is the avyaya bija, the imperishable seed that is your true identity and the source of all."

      ],
      "commentary": "In the beginning of Bhagavad Gita, the first six chapters, we have learned about ourselves as the Great Mahavakya from Upanishad Tattvamasi. That thou art that which you are seeking, that which is in control of this universe and my life. Who is that that I'm seeking is that you are that. So that paradigm shift about the one I'm seeking is not away from me, but my own self. And then we obviously have seen that the one which I consider myself me is just an equipment which I use to transact with this world. What I consider myself with this body, this mind, this intellect.\n\nIn chapter two we have this paradigm shift that that's not you. That's actually a vehicle you use to transact with this world. But you are imperishable, immutable, unborn, never dying. That's a paradigm shift we have learned in the in the second chapter then we also learned about the Karma Yoga act. I must as an individual in this world. So I do not perpetuate this ignorance I have about myself.\n\nSo we all learned about Karma Yoga. Selfless actions will purify my mind and intellect, the internal instrument so that I'll be able to see the reality as is where myself then the universal self has no duality. It is something similar to my room space. Right now I see is completely separated from the outside. But from another developer who wants to build a big building, this space is part of the space outside. And then obviously we have seen how to get the Karma Sanyas renunciation in actions by knowledge.\n\nBy knowing that I am not the doer, I can renounce my actions. I right now take the doership and ownership of my actions. Except I am not really ready to face the consequences. And when the consequences come, I blame other people. World was unfair, society is unjust. People don't recognize my contribution.\n\nAll of that is simply because of my lack of understanding that I am not the doer. I have very little capacity to act on my own. I'm just a part of this whole fabric which is called this universe. And I'm just this minute part which only can function when other parts function in its own way. So there's a Gnana Karma Sanyas Yoga. Once the knowledge takes place that I am not by individual and island who is capable of acting that I give up my ownership of my actions and I start accepting my role as a part in this whole. And then we obviously see in meditation, Dhyana Yoga how to now reflect and contemplate on myself so I can wipe this ignorance out of myself.\n\nThose are the first six chapters we learned about ourselves. We are not with who think we are. Bhagavan said, you are part of my own self. The next three chapters, 7, 8, and 9, are about \"That\" -- we learned about \"Tat\" first. \"Tat\" means \"That\" -- we learned about That. Then we said, who is That which I'm seeking as the Lord of this universe?\n\nTherefore Lord of my own self. Bhagavan gave his identity in the last three chapters saying I am who pervades in this entire universe in my unmanifest form, I am the source of this universe. I'll be the resting place for this universe. Everything comes out of me, everything dissolves in me. But we can recognize that. So this chapter Chapter 9 says Raja Vidya Raja Guya Yoga opened with a profound statement by Bhagavan said I manifest in this entire Jagat in my unmanifest form.\n\nBut people fail to recognize it out of their own ignorance. The world is full of Mudhas. They fail to recognize because of their own different identifications, notions, desires -- Mogha Asha, Mogha Karmaha. Bhagavan said you need the right equipment to recognize something which is unmanifest. There are radio waves in this room. I'm not sure now that they've all gone digital.\n\nBut think about how analog radio waves work. Radio waves are wireless. What are the waves which make my wireless phone work? To make them manifest, I need equipment. And when that equipment is fine-tuned and pointed in the right direction, it will manifest. Yesterday I was listening to one of these Gujarati Kathas by Ramesh bhai Oza.\n\nAnd I said this Samsar. We are completely surrounded by this Samsar that is constantly changing by this Maya. We are trying to find its end. Where does this Maya end? They say all over vernacular language said Sansar. You have to cross this Sansar, this ocean of Sansar.\n\nAnd for that you need a boat. He said that boat, Ramesh bhai, is your body, this mind, and this intellect. It's not an ordinary boat -- it's like a luxury liner. It is fully equipped with all that you need to cross over this ocean in a very luxurious way. But we fail to recognize the goal of this boat and direct it towards other things.\n\nSo we go in circles. Our scripture says that the ultimate goal of human life is to recognize your own self, your own reality, who you really are. In this evolution from a single-cell amoeba to where we are now, we are fully equipped to realize who we are. But we fail to recognize that. Why? Traividya mam somapaha puta papa yajnaih ishtva svargantim prarthayante.\n\nTe punya masadya surendra lokam asnanti divyan divi deva bhogan. How does this work? It works as simply as this: wherever you put your effort, whatever your goal is, that is what you will achieve. What do I want to become? We ask our little children all the time, \"What do you want to become when you grow up?\" \"Well, I want to be a fireman.\"\n\nWe never let him try to become a fireman. The parents say, \"Oh no, okay, that's a great idea. But no, no, you're not becoming a fireman. We are not going to let you do that.\" The point is: we don't always put our efforts into what we truly want to achieve. We achieve whatever we actually put our efforts into.\n\nNow here we're not talking about people who are completely deluded and don't know what they are doing. Here are the people who we consider ourselves to be like -- people who say, \"Look, I really don't need to do anything more. I'm a good man doing good things. So what else do I need to do?\" And I constantly say doing good is not good enough.\n\nThe knowledge about yourself and what you're trying to achieve is very important before you start any action. So here it says traividya. Those who are expert in three Vedas, those who have learned three Vedas -- they are knowledgeable people. They have jnana in the Vedas. They are somapaha -- puta papa.\n\nSomapaha means one who has drunk that soma drink. The soma drink was offered into the Agni, and then as prasad, you take it in a small quantity at the end of the Yajna. It indicates that the ritual is over and I'm taking whatever came out of this Yajna. Just like when you go to the temple, at the end of the Aarti, Panditji is standing there distributing the Charnamrit. It basically indicates that the performing of the Puja is over. That's the conclusion of my actions.\n\nAnd I'm taking whatever will come out of the action. They are also purified of the sins. They don't have any evil qualities. They are not evil doers. They are the Veda knowers. They have done the rituals as indicated in the Vedas.\n\nThey are free from sins. Yajnaih Ishtva Svargantim Prarthayante. Having performed this sacrifice of the Yajna, what does their desire say? They want to achieve heaven. Anything good we do -- what is the ultimate goal? I am doing this Puja, I am doing these actions.\n\nIn the end what we want is heaven. I can have all the good things in life and no sorrows. So Swarganti Parthayanti, the Purnya Masadya, Surendra Loka, Asnanti Divyan Divideva Bhagaana. So having earned all this merits of the good deeds they are doing the knowledge they have gathered from the Vedas. Vedas means the books of knowledge. So our Vedas are now expanded to many, many, many sciences.\n\nKnowing all this, I perform actions in a field of my chosen field and ask for Swarga. O Lord, give me a situation where there is no sorrow ever, always there is happiness. So they achieve the Surendra Loka. The Loka of the Devas. The place of Devalok. And we have talked about there are various Lokas.\n\nYou know, from Go Loka to Brahma Loka. After all they are all in my mind. When I am in a complete control and happiness, I feel I am in heaven. Things are going right. Kids are doing fine job. Nobody is bothering me.\n\nPeople are respecting me. Everybody is saying Neel, you are doing wonderful. Meena is not complaining. Surendra Loka Hatha Bhagawan says you reach that Surendra Loka. People achieve that state of Surendra Loka, Asnanti Divya Divideva Bhogan. They're enjoying all these divine pleasures which we learn in this Purana all the time.\n\nThese Apsaras are dancing. You know, somebody is doing this. Beautiful gardens, no drought anywhere. You enjoy all the Bhogas. But then I say tetam bhuktva swargalokam vishalam Enjoying these vast heavens and vast enjoyments in the heavens. Chine punya martha lo KE vishante.\n\nBut once those punyas are exhausted -- no matter how infinite you think they are -- consider Bill Gates, the wealthiest person in this world. You can still count his wealth, can't you? We can put a number to it. An expert CPA sits down, looks at his books, and comes up with \"this is your wealth.\" It can be spent. It may take longer than my wealth, maybe a very long time, but it can be exhausted, and it will be exhausted at some point. Bill Gates' descendants, whoever they may be, will eventually not have anything.\n\nI remember one Gujarati poem I heard is Sagaadi tami sa alamna bhik magda shariya sah alam who was the Mughal emperor. He said, I've seen his descendants begging in the street. Saga di tam es salam na bhik makta serhiye. So any wealth, no matter how infinite seem right now, will be exhausted in time. The same applies to you. Any amount of good deeds and good merits you have done to achieve these heavenly pleasures -- you will get them according to your efforts, according to your ability.\n\nBut once you reach there and enjoy those vast heavens, at some point they will exhaust, and you're back to square one. You're going to start from where you left off. Just like going on a vacation -- at the end of the vacation, you are back to square one, working for another 50 weeks to earn two weeks of vacation again. Evam Trayi Dharmam Anuprapanna Gatagatam Kama Kama Labhante. Thus, as described in the Vedas, they attain the state of going and coming.\n\nI perform good actions, achieve heavens, come back, keep performing good actions, go back and coming back. Obviously we say well that's good enough for me. And Bhagawan says that's why we are stuck into it, no? Because we are so addicted to this heavens, addicted to the results of my good actions that we continue to go back and forth, go back and forth into it.",
      "reflection": "Krishna describes people who are learned in the Vedas (traividya), who perform rituals correctly (yajnair ishtva), who are purified of sins (puta-papa) - yet they pray for heaven (svargati prarthayante). They achieve what they seek: divine pleasures in celestial realms. But here is the sobering truth - \"kshine punye martya lokam vishanti\" - when their merit is exhausted, they return to the mortal world. Even Bill Gates' wealth, though seemingly infinite, can be counted and eventually spent. So too, any accumulation of punya (merit), no matter how vast, will eventually deplete.\n\nThis is the cosmic trap: \"gatagatam kama-kama labhante\" - those driven by desires attain going and coming, an endless cycle of earning, enjoying, depleting, and returning. Like working 50 weeks for a 2-week vacation, then returning to work again, we strive for temporary heavens only to start over. We have a \"luxury liner\" of body-mind-intellect fully equipped to cross the ocean of samsara, yet we sail in circles, never reaching the far shore.\n\nHonest self-assessment: What is the goal of your spiritual practice? Is it a better rebirth, a more comfortable life, heavenly rewards? These are legitimate desires, but Krishna invites you to something greater - liberation from the cycle itself. This week, examine your deepest motivations. Are you seeking temporary relief or permanent freedom? The practices may look similar externally, but the intention determines the destination. What would shift if your goal became not better experiences within the dream, but awakening from the dream altogether?"

      "commentary": "In the beginning of Bhagavad Gita, the first six chapters, we have learned about ourselves as the Great Mahavakya from Upanishad Tattvamasi. That thou art that which you are seeking, that which is in control of this universe and my life. Who is that that I'm seeking is that you are that. So that paradigm shift about the one I'm seeking is not away from me, but my own self. And then we obviously have seen that the one which I consider myself me is just an equipment which I use to transact with this world. What I consider myself with this body, this mind, this intellect.\n\nIn chapter two we have this paradigm shift that that's not you. That's actually a vehicle you use to transact with this world. But you are imperishable, immutable, unborn, never dying. That's a paradigm shift we have learned in the in the second chapter then we also learned about the Karma Yoga act. I must as an individual in this world. So I do not perpetuate this ignorance I have about myself.\n\nSo we all learned about Karma Yoga. Selfless actions will purify my mind and intellect, the internal instrument so that I'll be able to see the reality as is where myself then the universal self has no duality. It is something similar to my room space. Right now I see is completely separated from the outside. But from another developer who wants to build a big building, this space is part of the space outside. And then obviously we have seen how to get the Karma Sanyas renunciation in actions by knowledge.\n\nBy knowing that I am not the doer, I can renounce my actions. I right now take the doership and ownership of my actions. Except I am not really ready to face the consequences. And when the consequences come, I blame other people. World was unfair, society is unjust. People don't recognize my contribution.\n\nAll of that is simply because of my lack of understanding that I am not the doer. I have very little capacity to act on my own. I'm just a part of this whole fabric which is called this universe. And I'm just this minute part which only can function when other parts function in its own way. So there's a Gnana Karma Sanyas Yoga. Once the knowledge takes place that I am not by individual and island who is capable of acting that I give up my ownership of my actions and I start accepting my role as a part in this whole. And then we obviously see in meditation, Dhyana Yoga how to now reflect and contemplate on myself so I can wipe this ignorance out of myself.\n\nThose are the first six chapters we learned about ourselves. We are not with who think we are. Bhagavan said, you are part of my own self. The next three chapters, 7, 8, and 9, are about \"That\" -- we learned about \"Tat\" first. \"Tat\" means \"That\" -- we learned about That. Then we said, who is That which I'm seeking as the Lord of this universe?\n\nTherefore Lord of my own self. Bhagavan gave his identity in the last three chapters saying I am who pervades in this entire universe in my unmanifest form, I am the source of this universe. I'll be the resting place for this universe. Everything comes out of me, everything dissolves in me. But we can recognize that. So this chapter Chapter 9 says Raja Vidya Raja Guya Yoga opened with a profound statement by Bhagavan said I manifest in this entire Jagat in my unmanifest form.\n\nBut people fail to recognize it out of their own ignorance. The world is full of Mudhas. They fail to recognize because of their own different identifications, notions, desires -- Mogha Asha, Mogha Karmaha. Bhagavan said you need the right equipment to recognize something which is unmanifest. There are radio waves in this room. I'm not sure now that they've all gone digital.\n\nBut think about how analog radio waves work. Radio waves are wireless. What are the waves which make my wireless phone work? To make them manifest, I need equipment. And when that equipment is fine-tuned and pointed in the right direction, it will manifest. Yesterday I was listening to one of these Gujarati Kathas by Ramesh bhai Oza.\n\nAnd I said this Samsar. We are completely surrounded by this Samsar that is constantly changing by this Maya. We are trying to find its end. Where does this Maya end? They say all over vernacular language said Sansar. You have to cross this Sansar, this ocean of Sansar.\n\nAnd for that you need a boat. He said that boat, Ramesh bhai, is your body, this mind, and this intellect. It's not an ordinary boat -- it's like a luxury liner. It is fully equipped with all that you need to cross over this ocean in a very luxurious way. But we fail to recognize the goal of this boat and direct it towards other things.\n\nSo we go in circles. Our scripture says that the ultimate goal of human life is to recognize your own self, your own reality, who you really are. In this evolution from a single-cell amoeba to where we are now, we are fully equipped to realize who we are. But we fail to recognize that. Why? Traividya Mam Somapaha Puta Papa Yajnaih Ishtva Svargantim Prarthayante.\n\nTe Punya Masadya Surendra Lokam Asnanti Divyan Divi Deva Bhogan. How does this work? It works as simply as this: wherever you put your effort, whatever your goal is, that is what you will achieve. What do I want to become? We ask our little children all the time, \"What do you want to become when you grow up?\" \"Well, I want to be a fireman.\"\n\nWe never let him try to become a fireman. The parents say, \"Oh no, okay, that's a great idea. But no, no, you're not becoming a fireman. We are not going to let you do that.\" The point is: we don't always put our efforts into what we truly want to achieve. We achieve whatever we actually put our efforts into.\n\nNow here we're not talking about people who are completely deluded and don't know what they are doing. Here are the people who we consider ourselves to be -- people who say, \"Look, I really don't need to do anything more. I'm a good man doing good things. So what else do I need to do?\" And I constantly say doing good is not good enough.\n\nThe knowledge about yourself and what you're trying to achieve is very important before you start any action. So here it says traividya. Those who are expert in three vedas, those who have learned three vedas, they are knowledgeable people. They have jnana of the Vedas. They are soma paha -- puta papa.\n\nOne who has drunk that soma drink. The soma drink was offered into the Agni, and then as prasad, you take it in a small quantity at the end of the Yajna. It indicates that the ritual is over and I'm taking whatever came out of this Yajna. Just like when you go to the temple, at the end of the Aarti, Panditji is standing there distributing the Charnamrit. It basically indicates that the performing of the Puja is over. That's the conclusion of my actions.\n\nAnd I'm taking whatever will come out of the action. They are also purified of the sins. They don't have any evil qualities. They are not evil doers. They are the Veda knowers. They have done the rituals as indicated in the Vedas.\n\nThey are free from sins. Yajnaih Ishtva Svargantim Prarthayante. Having performed this sacrifice of the Yajna, what does their desire say? They want to achieve heaven. Anything good we do -- what is the ultimate goal? I am doing this Puja, I am doing these actions.\n\nIn the end what we want is heaven. I can have all the good things in life and no sorrows. So Swarganti Parthayanti, the Purnya Masadya, Surendra Loka, Asnanti Divyan Divideva Bhagaana. So having earned all this merits of the good deeds they are doing the knowledge they have gathered from the Vedas. Vedas means the books of knowledge. So our Vedas are now expanded to many, many, many sciences.\n\nKnowing all this, I perform actions in a field of my chosen field and ask for Swarga. O Lord, give me a situation where there is no sorrow ever, always there is happiness. So they achieve the Surendra Loka. The Loka of the Devas. The place of Devalok. And we have talked about there are various Lokas.\n\nYou know, from Go Loka to Brahma Loka. After all they are all in my mind. When I am in a complete control and happiness, I feel I am in heaven. Things are going right. Kids are doing fine job. Nobody is bothering me.\n\nPeople are respecting me. Everybody is saying Neel, you are doing wonderful. Meena is not complaining. Surendra Loka Hatha Bhagawan says you reach that Surendra Loka. People achieve that state of Surendra Loka, Asnanti Divya Divideva Bhogan. They're enjoying all these divine pleasures which we learn in this Purana all the time.\n\nThese Apsaras are dancing. You know, somebody is doing this. Beautiful gardens, no drought anywhere. You enjoy all the Bhogas. But then I say tetam bhuktva swargalokam vishalam Enjoying these vast heavens and vast enjoyments in the heavens. Chine punya martha lo KE vishante.\n\nBut once those punyas are exhausted -- no matter how infinite you think they are -- consider Bill Gates, the wealthiest person in this world. You can still count his wealth, can't you? We can put a number to it. An expert CPA sits down, looks at his books, and comes up with \"this is your wealth.\" It can be spent. It may take longer than my wealth, maybe a very long time, but it can be exhausted, and it will be exhausted at some point. Bill Gates' descendants, whoever they may be, will eventually not have anything.\n\nI remember one Gujarati poem I heard is Sagaadi tami sa alamna bhik magda shariya sah alam who was the Mughal emperor. He said, I've seen his descendants begging in the street. Saga di tam es salam na bhik makta serhiye. So any wealth, no matter how infinite seem right now, will be exhausted in time. The same applies to you. Any amount of good deeds and good merits you have done to achieve these heavenly pleasures -- you will get them according to your efforts, according to your ability.\n\nBut once you reach there and enjoy those vast heavens, at some point they will exhaust, and you're back to square one. You're going to start from where you left off. Just like going on a vacation -- at the end of the vacation, you are back to square one, working for another 50 weeks to earn two weeks of vacation again. Evam Trayi Dharmam Anuprapanna Gatagatam Kama Kama Labhante. Thus, as described in the Vedas, they attain the state of going and coming.\n\nI perform good actions, achieve heavens, come back, keep performing good actions, go back and coming back. Obviously we say well that's good enough for me. And Bhagawan says that's why we are stuck into it, no? Because we are so addicted to this heavens, addicted to the results of my good actions that we continue to go back and forth, go back and forth into it.",
      "reflection": "Verse 22 contains one of the most reassuring promises in the Gita: \"Tesham nityabhiyuktanam yoga-kshemam vahamy aham\" - \"For those who worship Me with single-pointed devotion, I personally carry their yoga (acquisition of what they lack) and kshema (preservation of what they have).\" This is not about material prosperity but spiritual assurance: when you make the Divine your sole refuge, your spiritual welfare is guaranteed. You need not worry about whether you are progressing correctly - that responsibility shifts to the Lord.\n\nYet verse 23 adds nuance: even those who worship other deities with faith (shraddhayanvitah) are actually worshipping Krishna, though \"avidhi-purvakam\" - not in the proper manner. All sincere worship reaches the same destination, like tributaries flowing to the ocean. However, verse 24 warns: \"na tu mam abhijananti tattvena\" - they do not know Me in truth, and therefore \"cyavanti te\" - they fall back. The difference between temporary upliftment and permanent liberation lies in correct understanding, not just sincere feeling.\n\nPractical inquiry: Examine where you place your deepest trust. Is it in your abilities, your relationships, your financial security? These are forms of worship too - whatever you depend upon most is your functional deity. Krishna invites you to shift that ultimate reliance to the imperishable Self. This week, when anxiety arises about outcomes, practice this surrender: \"My part is to act with devotion; the yoga and kshema are not my burden to carry.\" Notice how this shifts your relationship with uncertainty from fear to trust."

      ],
      "commentary": "Obviously we have seen, as Bhagavan said, a royal secret, a grand secret is something which is very close to us but we fail to recognize. Therefore it's a secret. So the first declaration in this chapter, Bhagawan says that even though I pervade this entire Jagat, the universe, this creation, in my unmanifest form, all the beings dwell in me, but I don't dwell in them. They are in me, but I'm not in them. Which is obviously quite contrary to what we typically have learned all our life through all religions saying, Bhagwan, the Lord is within you. Here he said, even though I pervade the entire universe in my unmanifest form, I do not dwell in them, they dwell in Me.\n\nThen he even further clarifies in saying, but in reality, they are also not in me. In other words, if we can take it on its face value, if we say we are in him, obviously we are influencing his being. All my qualities of limitedness and imperfection will affect Him. And therefore he says, in reality, even they are not in Me. None of the qualities we see in this world, in the things and beings, Bhagavan Siddi does not exist in me. All the imperfections we see in this world, which we constantly wonder why Lord created this world like that.\n\nAnd he says, it is not in Me. And then obviously we have continued to discuss this, the relationship of this creation and the Lord self. And he says, even though this world is created by my Maya, I am the efficient cause for this world and I am also the material cause for this world. And therefore everything comes out of me and everything goes back to me. Because there is no nothing other than him existed before this creation was created. Then nothing will exist after this creation will be dissolved.\n\nAll that was there was his own self. So Bhagavan said, the relationship, less relationship between the Prakriti, the world, the manifest world as we know, and the unmanifest self which he says pervades entire Jagat, is that of a non existent relationship. But we have created this relationship. So then we have understood that everything which we do is because of the Lord's presence. As long as I'm conscious, I can act in this world. So Bhagavan said that everything you do eventually comes to me.\n\nI'm the only enjoyer. Consciousness is the only enjoyer in any being. Because only time we enjoy or suffer is when we are conscious about it. So we have seen that relationship. The Bhagavan says, everything comes out of me. Everything dissolves in me.\n\nEverything is possible because of me. Everything can be done only with my presence. However, because of our desires and wrong identification with this limited self, we create our own world of actions and our own world of worship. Depending on my desires, I worship the Lord of my heart. I put my efforts into the field where I want success. Bhagavan says, those who apply their efforts to fulfill their desires will be blessed to get their desires fulfilled by me.\n\nSo then we have seen in detail that the worshipers of the Devas goes to the Devas. Worshipper of the Bhutas goes to Bhutas. Worshipper of the Pitrus go to the Pitras. Deva, as we say Diva is to illumine which relates to our senses. So whoever perceives the visual arts, excel in visual arts. Whoever perceives performing arts, excels in performing arts.\n\nSo we know in this world we can prove from our own experience that wherever I put my efforts, wherever I identify myself, that's the field I'll excel. That the success I will receive. Same way we see the Pitruloka, the cultural heritage of our ancestors. Those who value that and put efforts in that, they will achieve that. Bhutas we have seen is the physical sciences. Science of this manifest world is Bhuta.\n\nThose who pursue that, they excel in that. But see, all these successes are finite in nature, exist in time and space. And once you achieve that success, enjoy the fruits of it. You to come back to pursue the next desire which you have and the next success you want. So this is the coming and going which Bhagavad Gita and Upanishad describe. We constantly achieve, things, enjoy it, come back, strive for something else, achieve that, come back, strive for something else.\n\nBut Bhagavan said, the one who worships me -- and we have seen, worship is devotion, devotion is love for the Divine, love is identification -- one who starts identifying with that eternal self will achieve me. That we have seen in the last three verses.\n\nVerse 26 actually says Patram Puspam falam toyam Yomi bhakta prayachati Tadaham bhakt Apurhat asnami prayatat Manaha. Whatsoever my devotee offer me with devotion, I accept that. That's good enough for me. You really don't have to have elaborate resources to worship Lord. And as we discussed last time, it takes away any excuse that I may have. Look, I'm not strong enough.\n\nI don't have enough strength or I don't have enough wealth. But once it is whatever you can offer from my own garden, whatever you can pluck and give it back to me, I'll be happy simply because I see your devotion. What he's looking for is your intention, your devotion and your attitude. So the next verse 27 says, Yat karosi yatasnasi yat johosi dadasiyat. Now here comes the prescription. We have seen in theory what is our relationship to the Lord?\n\nWhat can we do to remove this parallax between myself and his self? And then we may have an excuse saying, but I'm not capable of doing so. There is a very simple method. And you will not need anything more than what you already have. All you have to do is change your attitude in what you do. Yat Karoshi -- whatever you do, no matter who you are: a cobbler, a weaver, a doctor, an engineer, a president -- whatever you are, whatever you are doing. Yat Ashnasi -- whatever you are receiving, eating. Swamiji always expands the view and says eating is not only what we eat through our mouth but anything we take in through our eyes, ears, and all the senses. Yat Juhoshi -- whatever you offer back to the world. Yat Dadasi -- whatever you give as charity. Yat Tapasyasi -- whatever discipline you are following. We all follow some discipline -- I have to get up in the morning, do this, do that.\n\nWe follow discipline to achieve anything. Whatever discipline you are following to achieve what you are pursuing -- it is that simple: do not do it for yourself. Right now we are doing it for ourselves. It is very clear in my mind why I am doing this.\n\nNeil, why are you doing this? Well, because I want to do this. Neil, why don't you do this? Because I don't want to do that. It's as simple as that. So we know very clearly that all my actions are for me.\n\nFor me to achieve what I want. Bhagavan says, just change that attitude and have that attitude that I'm offering. All my actions, all my charities, all my disciplines, all that I'm receiving is to him. Because without his presence as the consciousness in me, none of these activities are possible in the first place. So who am I to take credit now when I say who am I? As I said I reside in my ego.\n\nThat \"I\" which resides in my ego -- if it gives up that \"I\" and says, \"I'm only possible as long as this consciousness functions through me, and I do not know where this consciousness comes from; it must be my Lord's presence\" -- then I offer all my actions to him. Bhagavan says, you will achieve myself. So that's a simple prescription. Do not change anything that you are doing except change your attitude that you're not doing it for yourself, you're doing it for him.\n\nTherefore, when you enjoy something, he's the enjoyer. When you suffer, he's the sufferer. You achieve something, he's the achiever. When you fail somewhere, he bears the failure. Shubha Ashubha Phalaih Evam Mokshyase -- thus you shall be freed from this bondage of Shubha and Ashubha, this bondage of labeling things as \"good for me\" or \"not good for me.\"\n\nWhen something good for me happens, I'm very proud. When something good doesn't happen for me, I blame everybody else other than me. He should have done this. Why didn't he tell me that? Why didn't he do that?\n\nWe find everybody responsible except me. Also it creates negative impression on my mind. Well, next time I never want to do that. I went to this organization for volunteer my services and they were not appreciative at all. I will never do that again. So I lost a chance of doing something good in life.\n\nThat bondage which is created by the impressions on my mind -- by perceiving \"this is good for me\" and \"this is bad for me\" -- you will be freed from. You will then see clearly, without having a cataract in your vision. I went to the doctor a few weeks ago and he said, \"Open your right eye.\" I could barely see anything, completely fuzzy. I said, \"I'm fine.\"\n\nHe said, that's because your left eye is taking over. And he said, thank God you don't have cataract in both eyes. That's exactly what he told me. So you can imagine if you have a cataract in a vision in both your eyes, the world will be very fuzzy. And Bhagavan said, that's where we are Right now. Because if one eye we see Subha, other we see a Subha and we have a very distorted view of this world.\n\nBut once we are freed from that, you have 2020 vision of this world. And then you will be doing exactly what is appropriate at an appropriate time. And when you do that, you know what you will achieve? So you'll be freed from by changing your attitude about everything you do. From doing it for myself to doing it for his self, I will be freed from the bondage of this is good and this is bad. Whatever the results come from my actions, I'll say, lord, you gave me this Buddhi to do this and I did that.\n\nNow this is what you are giving me as a prasad. I'm sure you know what you're doing. Then this must be good for me. I'm accepting it and I'm moving forward. Next step, Sannyasa, Yoga Yuktatma, Vimukto Mam Upeshasi. You will become Sannyasa and Yoga Yuktatma.\n\nWe have learned these terms in previous chapters that should I be a Sanyasi or should I be any yogi? He says sannyasi is the one who has given up the sense of agency. I am the doer that agency. One who gives up, he is called Sannyasi. Swamiji says, not the one who wears the saffron robe and has a long beard. One who has given up the sense of agency that I am the doer is a Sannyasi.\n\nThe yogi is the one who has given up the desire for the results of the actions. One who is given the Karma Phala is the yogi. You are established in Yoga if you have no particular desire for particular results. I will do my actions because I am not the Karma Faladatta. I am never the actor is never in control of its results. It's always somebody else.\n\nYou present a song, you present a performance. It's not who you are going to applaud. Other people are going to applaud or other people are going to throw stones at you.",
      "reflection": "\"Yanti deva-vrata devan\" - those devoted to the devas (sense pleasures, arts) go to the devas; those devoted to the pitrs (ancestors, cultural heritage) go to the pitrs; those devoted to the bhutas (physical sciences) excel there. Wherever you place your devoted attention and effort, that is what you become. This is both warning and promise: you have complete freedom to choose your destination through where you invest your identification. The question is not whether you will reach your goal, but whether your goal is worthy of your infinite potential.\n\nVerse 26 removes all excuses: \"Patram pushpam phalam toyam\" - a leaf, a flower, fruit, water - the simplest offerings are accepted when given with devotion. You need not be wealthy, learned, or specially qualified. What Krishna seeks is \"bhaktya prayacchati\" - the devotion behind the offering, not its material value. This demolishes the ego's protest that \"I'm not ready\" or \"I don't have enough.\" You have enough right now to begin.\n\nVerse 27 provides the complete prescription: \"Yat karoshi yad ashnasi yaj juhoshi dadasi yat\" - whatever you do, eat, offer, give, or practice as austerity - \"tat kurushva mad-arpanam\" - do it as an offering to Me. This is not about adding spiritual activities to your life; it is about transforming your entire life into spiritual practice. The cobbler stitching shoes, the executive closing deals, the parent changing diapers - all becomes worship when the attitude shifts from \"I do this for myself\" to \"I offer this to the Divine.\"\n\nThis week's practice: Choose one routine activity - eating, commuting, working - and consciously offer it before, during, and after. Notice: when you act as an offering rather than as the doer seeking results, how does your relationship with success and failure change?"

      "commentary": "Obviously we have seen, as Bhagavan said, a royal secret, a grand secret is something which is very close to us but we fail to recognize. Therefore it's a secret. So the first declaration in this chapter, Bhagawan says that even though I pervade this entire Jagat, the universe, this creation, in my unmanifest form, all the beings dwell in me, but I don't dwell in them. They are in me, but I'm not in them. Which is obviously quite contrary to what we typically have learned all our life through all religions saying, Bhagwan, the Lord is within you. Here he said, even though I pervade the entire universe in my unmanifest form, I do not dwell in them, they dwell in Me.\n\nThen he even further clarifies in saying, but in reality, they are also not in me. In other words, if we can take it on its face value, if we say we are in him, obviously we are influencing his being. All my qualities of limitedness and imperfection will affect Him. And therefore he says, in reality, even they are not in Me. None of the qualities we see in this world, in the things and beings, Bhagavan Siddi does not exist in me. All the imperfections we see in this world, which we constantly wonder why Lord created this world like that.\n\nAnd he says, it is not in Me. And then obviously we have continued to discuss this, the relationship of this creation and the Lord self. And he says, even though this world is created by my Maya, I am the efficient cause for this world and I am also the material cause for this world. And therefore everything comes out of me and everything goes back to me. Because there is no nothing other than him existed before this creation was created. Then nothing will exist after this creation will be dissolved.\n\nAll that was there was his own self. So Bhagavan said, the relationship, less relationship between the Prakriti, the world, the manifest world as we know, and the unmanifest self which he says pervades entire Jagat, is that of a non existent relationship. But we have created this relationship. So then we have understood that everything which we do is because of the Lord's presence. As long as I'm conscious, I can act in this world. So Bhagavan said that everything you do eventually comes to me.\n\nI'm the only enjoyer. Consciousness is the only enjoyer in any being. Because only time we enjoy or suffer is when we are conscious about it. So we have seen that relationship. The Bhagavan says, everything comes out of me. Everything dissolves in me.\n\nEverything is possible because of me. Everything can be done only with my presence. However, because of our desires and wrong identification with this limited self, we create our own world of actions and our own world of worship. Depending on my desires, I worship the Lord of my heart. I put my efforts into the field where I want success. Bhagavan says, those who apply their efforts to fulfill their desires will be blessed to get their desires fulfilled by me.\n\nSo then we have seen in detail that the worshipers of the Devas goes to the Devas. Worshipper of the Bhutas goes to Bhutas. Worshipper of the Pitrus go to the Pitras. Deva, as we say Diva is to illumine which relates to our senses. So whoever perceives the visual arts, excel in visual arts. Whoever perceives performing arts, excels in performing arts.\n\nSo we know in this world we can prove from our own experience that wherever I put my efforts, wherever I identify myself, that's the field I'll excel. That the success I will receive. Same way we see the Pitruloka, the cultural heritage of our ancestors. Those who value that and put efforts in that, they will achieve that. Bhutas we have seen is the physical sciences. Science of this manifest world is Bhuta.\n\nThose who pursue that, they excel in that. But see, all these successes are finite in nature, exist in time and space. And once you achieve that success, enjoy the fruits of it. You to come back to pursue the next desire which you have and the next success you want. So this is the coming and going which Bhagavad Gita and Upanishad describe. We constantly achieve, things, enjoy it, come back, strive for something else, achieve that, come back, strive for something else.\n\nBut Bhagavan said, the one who worships me -- and we have seen, worship is devotion, devotion is love for the Divine, love is identification -- one who starts identifying with that eternal self will achieve me. That we have seen in the last three verses.\n\nVerse 26 actually says Patram Puspam falam toyam Yomi bhakta prayachati Tadaham bhakt Apurhat asnami prayatat Manaha. Whatsoever my devotee offer me with devotion, I accept that. That's good enough for me. You really don't have to have elaborate resources to worship Lord. And as we discussed last time, it takes away any excuse that I may have. Look, I'm not strong enough.\n\nI don't have enough strength or I don't have enough wealth. But once it is whatever you can offer from my own garden, whatever you can pluck and give it back to me, I'll be happy simply because I see your devotion. What he's looking for is your intention, your devotion and your attitude. So the next verse 27 says, Yat karosi yatasnasi yat johosi dadasiyat. Now here comes the prescription. We have seen in theory what is our relationship to the Lord?\n\nWhat can we do to remove this parallax between myself and his self? And then we may have an excuse saying, but I'm not capable of doing so. There is a very simple method. And you will not need anything more than what you already have. All you have to do is change your attitude in what you do. Yat Karoshi -- whatever you do, no matter who you are: a cobbler, a weaver, a doctor, an engineer, a president -- whatever you are, whatever you are doing. Yat Ashnasi -- whatever you are receiving, eating. Swamiji always expands the view and says eating is not only what we eat through our mouth but anything we take in through our eyes, ears, and all the senses. Yat Juhoshi -- whatever you offer back to the world. Yat Dadasi -- whatever you give as charity. Yat Tapasyasi -- whatever discipline you are following. We all follow some discipline -- I have to get up in the morning, do this, do that.\n\nWe follow discipline to achieve anything. Whatever discipline you are following to achieve what you are pursuing -- it is that simple: do not do it for yourself. Right now we are doing it for ourselves. It is very clear in my mind why I am doing this.\n\nNeil, why are you doing this? Well, because I want to do this. Neil, why don't you do this? Because I don't want to do that. It's as simple as that. So we know very clearly that all my actions are for me.\n\nFor me to achieve what I want. Bhagavan says, just change that attitude and have that attitude that I'm offering. All my actions, all my charities, all my disciplines, all that I'm receiving is to him. Because without his presence as the consciousness in me, none of these activities are possible in the first place. So who am I to take credit now when I say who am I? As I said I reside in my ego.\n\nThat \"I\" which resides in my ego -- if it gives up that \"I\" and says, \"I'm only possible as long as this consciousness functions through me, and I do not know where this consciousness comes from; it must be my Lord's presence\" -- then I offer all my actions to him. Bhagavan says, you will achieve myself. So that's a simple prescription. Do not change anything that you are doing except change your attitude that you're not doing it for yourself, you're doing it for him.\n\nTherefore, when you enjoy something, he's the enjoyer. When you suffer, he's the sufferer. You achieve something, he's the achiever. When you fail somewhere, he bears the failure. Shubha Ashubha Phalaih Evam Mokshyase -- thus you shall be freed from this bondage of Shubha and Ashubha, this bondage of labeling things as \"good for me\" or \"not good for me.\"\n\nWhen something good for me happens, I'm very proud. When something good doesn't happen for me, I blame everybody else other than me. He should have done this. Why didn't he tell me that? Why didn't he do that?\n\nWe find everybody responsible except me. Also it creates negative impression on my mind. Well, next time I never want to do that. I went to this organization for volunteer my services and they were not appreciative at all. I will never do that again. So I lost a chance of doing something good in life.\n\nThat bondage which is created by the impressions on my mind -- by perceiving \"this is good for me\" and \"this is bad for me\" -- you will be freed from. You will then see clearly, without having a cataract in your vision. I went to the doctor a few weeks ago and he said, \"Open your right eye.\" I could barely see anything, completely fuzzy. I said, \"I'm fine.\"\n\nHe said, that's because your left eye is taking over. And he said, thank God you don't have cataract in both eyes. That's exactly what he told me. So you can imagine if you have a cataract in a vision in both your eyes, the world will be very fuzzy. And Bhagavan said, that's where we are Right now. Because if one eye we see Subha, other we see a Subha and we have a very distorted view of this world.\n\nBut once we are freed from that, you have 2020 vision of this world. And then you will be doing exactly what is appropriate at an appropriate time. And when you do that, you know what you will achieve? So you'll be freed from by changing your attitude about everything you do. From doing it for myself to doing it for his self, I will be freed from the bondage of this is good and this is bad. Whatever the results come from my actions, I'll say, lord, you gave me this Buddhi to do this and I did that.\n\nNow this is what you are giving me as a prasad. I'm sure you know what you're doing. Then this must be good for me. I'm accepting it and I'm moving forward. Next step, Sannyasa, Yoga Yuktatma, Vimukto Mam Upeshasi. You will become Sannyasa and Yoga Yuktatma.\n\nWe have learned these terms in previous chapters that should I be a Sanyasi or should I be any yogi? He says sannyasi is the one who has given up the sense of agency. I am the doer that agency. One who gives up, he is called Sannyasi. Swamiji says, not the one who wears the saffron robe and has a long beard. One who has given up the sense of agency that I am the doer is a Sannyasi.\n\nThe yogi is the one who has given up the desire for the results of the actions. One who is given the Karma Phala is the yogi. You are established in Yoga if you have no particular desire for particular results. I will do my actions because I am not the Karma Faladatta. I am never the actor is never in control of its results. It's always somebody else.\n\nYou present a song, you present a performance. It's not who you are going to applaud. Other people are going to applaud or other people are going to throw stones at you.",
      "reflection": "Verse 28 promises liberation from \"shubha-ashubha-phalaih\" - the bondage created by labeling results as good or bad. Like having cataracts in both eyes, we see a fuzzy, distorted world when we constantly sort experiences into favorable and unfavorable. The sannyasa-yoga described here is not about external renunciation but internal freedom: sannyasi is one who gives up the sense of doership; yogi is one who gives up attachment to specific results. When both are achieved, you act with full engagement yet remain untouched by outcomes - not through suppression but through understanding.\n\n\"Samo'ham sarva-bhuteshu\" (verse 29) - \"I am the same to all beings.\" The Divine has no favorites. Like a parent whose love for all children is equal (even if one visits more often), Krishna's relationship with every being is identical. The difference we experience is not in His giving but in our receiving. \"Ye bhajanti tu mam bhaktya, mayi te teshu chapy aham\" - those who worship with devotion dwell in Him, and He in them. The intimacy is not one-sided; it is mutual. You are not reaching toward a distant God; you are recognizing the God who has never left.\n\nVerse 30 offers radical hope: \"Api chet su-duracharo\" - even the worst sinner, if they worship with undivided devotion, should be considered righteous (sadhur eva). This is not endorsement of wrongdoing but acknowledgment that right resolve changes everything. Your past does not define your future; your present orientation does. Today, release any sense that you are disqualified from spiritual progress due to past mistakes. Ask: \"Am I now, in this moment, rightly resolved toward truth?\" That is the only question that matters."

      "commentary": "So we are concluding chapter nine today. Chapter nine, Raja Vidya, Raja Guja Yoga. Yoga of Royal Knowledge and Royal Secret. And obviously the question last time, what is this secret? Well, we have discussed many times, the secret is, where does my happiness lie? All my life I was seeking one thing and one thing alone.\n\nThat is permanent happiness and permanent peace. I have tried everywhere, I have tried in getting knowledge, learning things in this world. I have tried in accomplishing things, achieving things, acquiring things in my relationships. But in the end, every happiness came with associated unhappiness. As we have learned through our life, anything which has the capacity to give me happiness has an equal capacity to give me unhappiness. In our relationships we know exactly: the closer you are, the more chances of getting hurt. Even though we know what we are looking for and look everywhere in our life, we can't find our happiness.\n\nSo that's the secret. And whatever makes me find that will be the knowledge which will be royal knowledge. So Brahmagnan is the secret. Unless you have the Brahmagnaan, you will never find this permanent happiness. And Brahma Vidya is the Raja Vidya. And Swamiji explains that why it is called Rajavidya.\n\nRaja Vidya is something which is available to all. The road which is available to everybody, Rajmarg, anybody can pass through that road, not restricted. It is the Raja Vidya because it is available to all. So the Brahma Vidya is the Rajavidya because this knowledge is available to all. Brahma Ghana is the royal sacred. Because everyone has a birthright to know that knowledge.\n\nAnd still none of us is capable of finding it easily. So Bhagavan said that that is the knowledge, that is the secret. I'm going to tell you which is Pavitram Ida Muthamam. It is the highest purifier. Once you wake up from your dream, the waking state is the highest purifier of your dream state. All your problems of the dream state go away.\n\nSo we have started learning that Brahmagna is the one secret I need to unlock. And the key is the Brahma Vidya. And therefore rest of the chapter is spent in describing what Brahman is, what is the nature of Brahman and what my relationship is with Him. So we have elaborately seen that there is nothing in this world which is other than Brahman. In his manifest form he becomes this Prakriti, this manifestation. Anything which I see is nothing but the manifestation of the same reality.\n\nFrom science point of view, we have discussed the singularity at one time because of the Big Bang. It is now a plurality and someday it will recede back into singularity again. So the same entity which is pervading everywhere is the basis of this reality as we know. And then what is my relationship? You see it's a relationship less relation that all the qualities of Brahman are in me because I am his manifestation. I am nothing but that this world is created by the Creator out of his own self.\n\nBecause there is no other material was available to Him. Only available material to create this world was his own self. Because if you think that there is other material available then he obviously is not complete God. So we have to come to the conclusion that his self and this universe and myself is one and the same. But I just can't recognize it. That is the Avidy which we have to dispel.\n\nSo this knowledge will dispel that Avidya Bhagavan said and therefore it is Rajavidy. So we have learned the nature of the Brahman that everything is because of Brahman. Everything resides in Brahman but Brahman does not reside in it. In other words, my limitations are not in Brahman. My ignorance is not part of Brahman. The Creator with his power of Maya he creates this universe through the Mayapati.\n\nHe is the Lord of Maya, Lord of this illusion. But I am under the spell of Maya and therefore I'm in a Maya Jal. I'm in the web of Maya. I can't see it clearly what my self is. He said the Vidya which will take me there would be the Raja Vidya, that which dispels my ignorance about my own self. When I start seeing my relationship clearly with him then I will be Dharmaatma.\n\nI'll be a righteous soul. So Bhagavan has talked about the why people can't see it because of the Moga Asa Mogha actions. I'll find my happiness here, I'll find my happiness there. And that's where we are confused. But the Mahatma, they single pointedly seek that happiness at the source of happiness which is the Brahman which is the Almighty Lord which is my own self. So what is my relationship with Him?\n\nHe is as close to me as my own self. But there is no special relationship he is with me. Because I am a Dharmatma and others are not good people. He says I am same to Samoham Sarva Bhulteshu. My relationship to them is same as my relationship to you, him, her, my relationship to my children. If they have my four children, that's exactly same.\n\nBut one is closer to me than another, because he identifies with me more, he writes to me more, he calls me up more, he comes to see me more -- so I have more relationship with him. The one who never calls me, never writes me, never comes to Thanksgiving dinner -- I have less relationship with him. But my relationship with all of them is exactly the same. Samoham Sarva Bhuteshu -- everything and every being is made up of me alone.\n\nTherefore relationship is exactly same. Just as my relationship with my left leg and right leg exactly same. Even though I rely on my left leg more because right leg is broken. So Bhagavan says Samoham Sarva Bhuteshru and each one is the birthright to know this. But because we are deluded, therefore I don't recognize it. Just because I think that I have not done something right in my past that does not stop me from realizing this truth.\n\nDurachara -- Su is a prefix meaning supreme. Su-Durachara means one who is the highest sinner. Even he has the right to realize me. Bhajate Mam Ananya Bhak -- once he single-pointedly identifies with me. Sadhu Eva Sa Mantavyaha Samyak Vyavasito Hi Saha -- once he is rightfully resolved, once he has completely realized what is the right way of living, what is his swadharma, then he should be considered a Sadhu.\n\nSwamiji says this is Krishna's missionary zeal to expand the tent to its infinity. Everybody is in it, nobody left out. So once that person is rightly resolved, we must consider him as a good person. Forget about what his past is all about. And the next verse says why that is because Kshhipram Bhavati Dharmatma. Once you have a right resolve, you very soon will become what you resolved to become.\n\nSee, it's all about your conviction about what is right and what is wrong. What is the right action? What is the wrong action? What is the right way of living and what is the wrong way of living. This is the right way to live. You will become that in no time.\n\nBhagawan saswat shantim ni gachati. And you will achieve that in eternal peace. Peace which I had been seeking all my life and I have blamed everybody other than me. Children are not behaving to my expectations. Once you resolve rightfully where your Santi is, you will in no time achieve it. Satsvatsanti m ni gachadhi.\n\nSuch a person will achieve that eternal peace in no time. Kaunteya Pratijanihi Na Me Bhaktah Pranashyati. It is obviously a little pat on Arjuna's back. Because the Pandavas, at no time during their life, ever questioned their relationship with Krishna or their faith in Krishna. So in our case also, if I have complete faith in that Supreme Lord who is myself, then my peace lies there. Then Bhagavan says Na Me Bhaktah Pranashyati -- one who identifies with me will never be destroyed.\n\nNever be destroyed in the sense that he will never lose his peace again. Once I have decided where my peace is and am rightfully pursuing it single-pointedly, Bhagavan said he will never go back to getting unhappy again.\n\nThe next verse has been difficult for people to translate and understand. Mam Hi Partha Vyapashritya Ye Api Syuhu Papayonayaha. Then he described: Striyo Vaishyah Tatha Shudrah Te Api Yanti Param Gatim. They also achieve my being.\n\nThey are the people who are born in Papayoni. Correct understanding can only be gained if we can define Papayoni correctly. That's where the problem is, right? Because he actually enumerated and gave examples of classes of people who are born in Papayoni. It is very loosely translated as \"sinful birth.\" Well, then you have to define sin.\n\nSin we have defined as a negative impression on my mind which is damaging to my chances of getting peace. When my mind is agitated, no matter how much of a Gnani I am, I will not have peace. We know that when the mind is agitated with any negative impression, there is no peace. Papa is that which robs away my peace. So Papayoni is the environment which has the most chances of creating negative impressions on my mind. Environment is not something I control.\n\nSo if I am placed in that environment, it is not my fault. It is not something I have chosen; I happen to be in that environment. In modern day, we call it the disadvantaged class of people, or minority. In India, Jains have fought very hard to be classified as a minority, and they finally got the same status as Muslims and Christians who are considered minorities in India. It is not that they are saying, \"We are bad, just consider us.\" No, they say, \"We are disadvantaged because we are not the majority.\"\n\nSo Papayoni creates an environment which has more chances of putting negative impressions on my mind. Bhagavan said that people who do not have the privilege of being in the most pious and best environment -- and those people are Striya, Vaishya, Tatha Shudra -- in which society, in which time of history, do you think that women have had the same rights as men, including in 2016? We know they are always disadvantaged. It is not their fault. It is the society's fault if the way it is designed does not give them equal opportunity. There is a movie coming up, the Birth of a Nation.\n\nIt's about how and I have not seen anything. I just saw a clip on one of those talk show. They said that in the slavery days a black child and white child will be playing together till the age of about 11. About 11 they will decide that only now the black child has reached highest of his or her development. So he doesn't need to be sent to school or do anything about it. He can now start working.\n\nWhite child will continue in his development of learning and going to school. So is that something you consider a Papa Yoni -- because the child is born in that yoni, or because the society is not giving him an opportunity? Bhagavan said: the society which has not given them the opportunity they deserve -- an opportunity rightfully theirs, which is their birthright -- we are not giving them that. Even though you are born in that class of people who are disadvantaged, you have equal right to achieve the highest potential. In those days, and even today, there are classes which are disadvantaged.\n\nStriya, Vaishya, Tatha Shudra -- women, merchants, laborers -- by history, everybody can vouch for it that they never had equal rights.",
      "reflection": "\"Kshipram bhavati dharmatma\" - one who is rightly resolved quickly becomes righteous. This is the transformative power of conviction. Once you truly decide on the direction of your life, the becoming follows swiftly. \"Shashvat shantim nigacchati\" - such a person attains eternal peace. Then Krishna makes a solemn declaration: \"Kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah pranashyati\" - O Arjuna, proclaim this truth: my devotee never perishes. This is not just Krishna's promise; He asks Arjuna to declare it, making the disciple a witness and messenger of this assurance.\n\nVerse 32 is often misunderstood. \"Papa-yonayah\" does not mean sinful by birth but disadvantaged by circumstance - those in environments that make spiritual pursuit more difficult. Women, merchants, laborers - in ancient society, these groups had fewer opportunities for formal spiritual study. Krishna's point is revolutionary: even those whom society has marginalized can attain the highest goal (\"te'pi yanti param gatim\"). The Gita democratizes liberation. Your birth, social status, education, or past mistakes do not disqualify you. As Swamiji says, this is \"Krishna's missionary zeal to expand the tent to infinity\" - everybody is included, nobody left out.\n\nVerse 33 then asks: if even the disadvantaged can reach the Supreme, how much more easily can those with advantages - the learned, the devoted, the royal sages? \"Anityam asukham lokam imam prapya bhajasva mam\" - having come to this impermanent, joyless world, worship Me. This week, honestly assess: What excuses have you been making for not deepening your spiritual practice? Whatever they are - lack of time, education, purity, worthiness - Krishna has removed them. The question is no longer \"can I?\" but \"will I?\""

All your problems of the dream state go away.\n\nSo we have started learning that Brahmagna is the one secret I need to unlock. And the key is the Brahma Vidya. And therefore rest of the chapter is spent in describing what Brahman is, what is the nature of Brahman and what my relationship is with Him. So we have elaborately seen that there is nothing in this world which is other than Brahman. In his manifest form he becomes this Prakriti, this manifestation. Anything which I see is nothing but the manifestation of the same reality.\n\nFrom science point of view, we have discussed the singularity at one time because of the Big Bang. It is now a plurality and someday it will recede back into singularity again. So the same entity which is pervading everywhere is the basis of this reality as we know. And then what is my relationship? You see it's a relationship less relation that all the qualities of Brahman are in me because I am his manifestation. I am nothing but that this world is created by the Creator out of his own self.\n\nBecause there is no other material was available to Him. Only available material to create this world was his own self. Because if you think that there is other material available then he obviously is not complete God. So we have to come to the conclusion that his self and this universe and myself is one and the same. But I just can't recognize it. That is the Avidy which we have to dispel.\n\nSo this knowledge will dispel that Avidya Bhagavan said and therefore it is Rajavidy. So we have learned the nature of the Brahman that everything is because of Brahman. Everything resides in Brahman but Brahman does not reside in it. In other words, my limitations are not in Brahman. My ignorance is not part of Brahman. The Creator with his power of Maya he creates this universe through the Mayapati.\n\nHe is the Lord of Maya, Lord of this illusion. But I am under the spell of Maya and therefore I'm in a Maya Jal. I'm in the web of Maya. I can't see it clearly what my self is. He said the Vidya which will take me there would be the Raja Vidya, that which dispels my ignorance about my own self. When I start seeing my relationship clearly with him then I will be Dharmaatma.\n\nI'll be a righteous soul. So Bhagavan has talked about the why people can't see it because of the Moga Asa Mogha actions. I'll find my happiness here, I'll find my happiness there. And that's where we are confused. But the Mahatma, they single pointedly seek that happiness at the source of happiness which is the Brahman which is the Almighty Lord which is my own self. So what is my relationship with Him?\n\nHe is as close to me as my own self. But there is no special relationship he is with me. Because I am a Dharmatma and others are not good people. He says I am same to Samoham Sarva Bhulteshu. My relationship to them is same as my relationship to you, him, her, my relationship to my children. If they have my four children, that's exactly same.\n\nBut one is closer to me than another, because he identifies with me more, he writes to me more, he calls me up more, he comes to see me more -- so I have more relationship with him. The one who never calls me, never writes me, never comes to Thanksgiving dinner -- I have less relationship with him. But my relationship with all of them is exactly the same. Samoham Sarva Bhuteshu -- everything and every being is made up of me alone.\n\nTherefore relationship is exactly same. Just as my relationship with my left leg and right leg exactly same. Even though I rely on my left leg more because right leg is broken. So Bhagavan says Samoham Sarva Bhuteshru and each one is the birthright to know this. But because we are deluded, therefore I don't recognize it. Just because I think that I have not done something right in my past that does not stop me from realizing this truth.\n\nDurachara -- Su is a prefix meaning supreme. Su-Durachara means one who is the highest sinner. Even he has the right to realize me. Bhajate Mam Ananya Bhak -- once he single-pointedly identifies with me. Sadhu Eva Sa Mantavyaha Samyak Vyavasito Hi Saha -- once he is rightfully resolved, once he has completely realized what is the right way of living, what is his swadharma, then he should be considered a Sadhu.\n\nSwamiji says this is Krishna's missionary zeal to expand the tent to its infinity. Everybody is in it, nobody left out. So once that person is rightly resolved, we must consider him as a good person. Forget about what his past is all about. And the next verse says why that is because Kshhipram Bhavati Dharmatma. Once you have a right resolve, you very soon will become what you resolved to become.\n\nSee, it's all about your conviction about what is right and what is wrong. What is the right action? What is the wrong action? What is the right way of living and what is the wrong way of living. This is the right way to live. You will become that in no time.\n\nBhagawan saswat shantim ni gachati. And you will achieve that in eternal peace. Peace which I had been seeking all my life and I have blamed everybody other than me. Children are not behaving to my expectations. Once you resolve rightfully where your Santi is, you will in no time achieve it. Satsvatsanti m ni gachadhi.\n\nSuch a person will achieve that eternal peace in no time. Kaunteya Pratijanihi Na Me Bhaktah Pranashyati. It is obviously a little pat on Arjuna's back. Because the Pandavas, at no time during their life, ever questioned their relationship with Krishna or their faith in Krishna. So in our case also, if I have complete faith in that Supreme Lord who is myself, then my peace lies there. Then Bhagavan says Na Me Bhaktah Pranashyati -- one who identifies with me will never be destroyed.\n\nNever be destroyed in the sense that he will never lose his peace again. Once I have decided where my peace is and am rightfully pursuing it single-pointedly, Bhagavan said he will never go back to getting unhappy again.\n\nThe next verse has been difficult for people to translate and understand. Mam Hi Partha Vyapashritya Ye Api Syuhu Papayonayaha. Then he described: Striyo Vaishyah Tatha Shudrah Te Api Yanti Param Gatim. They also achieve my being.\n\nThey are the people who are born in Papayoni. Correct understanding can only be gained if we can define Papayoni correctly. That's where the problem is, right? Because he actually enumerated and gave examples of classes of people who are born in Papayoni. It is very loosely translated as \"sinful birth.\" Well, then you have to define sin.\n\nSin we have defined as a negative impression on my mind which is damaging to my chances of getting peace. When my mind is agitated, no matter how much of a Gnani I am, I will not have peace. We know that when the mind is agitated with any negative impression, there is no peace. Papa is that which robs away my peace. So Papayoni is the environment which has the most chances of creating negative impressions on my mind. Environment is not something I control.\n\nSo if I am placed in that environment, it is not my fault. It is not something I have chosen; I happen to be in that environment. In modern day, we call it the disadvantaged class of people, or minority. In India, Jains have fought very hard to be classified as a minority, and they finally got the same status as Muslims and Christians who are considered minorities in India. It is not that they are saying, \"We are bad, just consider us.\" No, they say, \"We are disadvantaged because we are not the majority.\"\n\nSo Papayoni creates an environment which has more chances of putting negative impressions on my mind. Bhagavan said that people who do not have the privilege of being in the most pious and best environment -- and those people are Striya, Vaishya, Tatha Shudra -- in which society, in which time of history, do you think that women have had the same rights as men, including in 2016? We know they are always disadvantaged. It is not their fault. It is the society's fault if the way it is designed does not give them equal opportunity. There is a movie coming up, the Birth of a Nation.\n\nIt's about how and I have not seen anything. I just saw a clip on one of those talk show. They said that in the slavery days a black child and white child will be playing together till the age of about 11. About 11 they will decide that only now the black child has reached highest of his or her development. So he doesn't need to be sent to school or do anything about it. He can now start working.\n\nWhite child will continue in his development of learning and going to school. So is that something you consider a Papa Yoni -- because the child is born in that yoni, or because the society is not giving him an opportunity? Bhagavan said: the society which has not given them the opportunity they deserve -- an opportunity rightfully theirs, which is their birthright -- we are not giving them that. Even though you are born in that class of people who are disadvantaged, you have equal right to achieve the highest potential. In those days, and even today, there are classes which are disadvantaged.\n\nStriya, Vaishya, Tatha Shudra -- women, merchants, laborers -- by history, everybody can vouch for it that they never had equal rights.",
      "reflection": "The final verse of Chapter 9 distills the entire teaching into four instructions: \"Man-mana bhava\" - fix your mind on Me; \"mad-bhakto\" - be My devotee; \"mad-yaji\" - sacrifice to Me; \"mam namaskuru\" - bow to Me. These are not four separate practices but one integrated orientation: complete absorption in the Divine through thought, feeling, action, and humility. The promise follows: \"Mam evaishyasi\" - you shall come to Me alone.\n\n\"Yuktvaivam atmanam mat-parayanah\" - having thus united the self, with Me as your supreme goal. The Sanskrit \"parayana\" means ultimate destination, final refuge. When the Divine becomes your parayana - not one goal among many but THE goal that contains all others - liberation is assured. This is not about abandoning worldly responsibilities but about recognizing what they ultimately serve. The executive working to support family, the artist creating beauty, the scientist seeking truth - all activities can have mat-parayanah (the Divine as supreme goal) as their hidden foundation.\n\nThis verse appears again at the end of Chapter 18, framing the entire Gita's teaching. Chapter 9 reveals the royal secret: you are not separate from the Divine you seek. The path is simply the progressive removal of the illusion that you ever were separate. This week, make this verse your constant companion. When the mind wanders, return: \"Man-mana bhava\" - let my mind rest in You. When devotion wavers, remember: \"mad-bhakto\" - I am Your devotee, whether I feel it or not. When action becomes self-serving, redirect: \"mad-yaji\" - this is my offering. When pride arises, bow: \"mam namaskuru\" - I am not the doer; You are the source and goal of all."

      "commentary": "So we completed chapter nine and we'll now be discussing chapter 10, Vibhuti Yoga. In the first six chapters we learned about I, the limited being which is part of this Prakriti. Prakriti has three constituent parts: Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas. Everything in this Prakriti is made up of these three Gunas; whichever has the predominance, that becomes my nature. Sattva is purity, Rajas is activity, and Tamas is inertia.\n\nEverything in this Prakriti is made up of these three gunas, and we have learned the nature of Prakriti in chapter seven. Up to chapter six we learnt about us as the limited beings and the makeup of our beings. From chapter 7 onward, we are learning about the nature of the supreme, the Lord. In chapter seven we learnt about his lower natures. Bhagavan said this Ashtadha Prakriti: Bhumi, Apah, Analaha, Kham, Vayu, Mana, Buddhi, Ahankara.\n\nThe eight — five great elements, Mind, intellect, and Ahankara — are the nature of Prakriti, my lower nature. These are not different from me, but they are my lower nature in the sense of the grosser manifestation which you and I can perceive through our senses. We discussed Prakriti in chapter seven. Chapter eight said that in Prakriti, things are unmanifest in the beginning, then manifest in the middle, then unmanifest again. So Prakriti itself has two aspects.\n\nOne is manifest, one is unmanifest. There is unmanifest, Prakriti. There is manifest Prakriti. Bhagawan said, other than this unmanifest, there is another unmanifest which is my higher. Prakriti, which always remains unmanifest, is the support of all things and beings. So in chapter 8, Akshara Brahma Yoga, we learnt about this unmanifest nature of Purusha remaining unmanifest, it supports everything.\n\nBhagawan said that I'm the origin of all things and beings and I'm also the dissolution of all things and beings. I get confused about my being and therefore I'm not experiencing the very nature of the supreme. The very nature of the supreme is Sat-Chit-Ananda — Sat is existence, Chit is knowledge, and Ananda is happiness or bliss. So right now I'm not truly experiencing Sat. I know I exist, but I'm afraid I'll become non-existent. I'm not experiencing Sat fully.\n\nI know something, but I don't know everything, so I'm not experiencing Chit either. And Ananda is my biggest problem. Happiness comes and goes. For a while I'm happy, and most of the time I'm just pursuing happiness.\n\nSo I'm trying to get out of the impermanent nature of Ananda into the permanent nature of Ananda, trying to find out where that permanent Ananda is. Bhagavan in the ninth chapter says that's the royal secret, the greatest secret: it is your very nature to be Sat-Chit-Ananda, but you are not experiencing it. That knowledge which connects me back to my real nature is the royal knowledge.\n\nSo that was chapter nine. At the end of chapter nine, Bhagavan said the only way one can experience this is Manmana Bhava. Make your mind focused on me. Offer yourself to me. Make me as your goal Yuktva Mat Parayanaha. In other words, completely identify with me and you will experience that Ananda which you are seeking.\n\nNow how do I get to that level where I can completely identify with him is the subject of chapter 10. So it's called Vibhuti Yoga. Yoga of divine glories. I see, perceive, touch and feel this world of my experiences. But I break them all down into perishable things and beings. Anything which I see, I can say I understand this.\n\nThis is just a table. All this, I understand this. Well, I understand this is plant kingdom. So I break this down into the impermanent, perishable conglomeration of things and beings which by very nature they are impermanent and not divine. I don't consider them as divine. I don't say this table is divine.\n\nI don't consider my colleagues as divine. Even when some wise person comes. But he is not Bhagavan. We have difficulty if somebody calls himself Bhagawan because we cannot associate the divinity with the objects of my perception. So how to change that and start seeing Divinity in everything I see and touch and feel is the subject of chapter 10. Therefore it is called Yoga of Divine Glory.\n\nHow to see this divinity, this divine glories in everything and being that I come across in the world of my experiences, my world of my perception. So Bhagavan starts this chapter without waiting for Arjuna to ask questions because he saw that he is enjoying it and he wanted to continue the theme which he started in chapter seven about the Prakriti. When he says, this Prakriti is nothing but my lower nature. Everything in this Prakriti Aa Sesah. There is nothing left in this Prakriti which is not divine. But we don't really see that way.\n\nIn fact, we divide this world into good and evil. We have some level of acceptance that good is divine. But we are difficult when it comes to bad and ugly. I can't associate divinity with it. This chapter will say that even that is only possible. Bad is only possible because of my presence and evil is only possible because of my presence.\n\nThere is nothing that can happen or exist in this world without me. So chapter opens with Bhagavan's statement says Bhuya Eva Mahabaho srunume paramam vacha yatta te aham Priyamanaya vakshyami Hita Kamya. I wish your welfare Hita Kamiya. Therefore I'm going to continue. And in last chapter I told you that this knowledge is available to all. And we discussed that verse which is very troublesome to discuss and say.\n\nThose who are born in Papayonayaha Triya vaishya tathakshadraha. Even they have equal right when they come to me. If they focus their mind onto me. We discuss why Papayoni. Anything which takes me away from my identification with the supreme is sin. That which does not recognize my true potential which is Sat chit in Ananda is Papa.\n\nIt is the impurity on my mind which is right now not letting me see who I am. An environment which is more likely to create wrong impressions on my mind is Papa Yoni. Yoni is a collection of people which creates an environment that is similar for each other — a symbiotic relationship. It's like a satsang in reverse — bad company. If I'm put in that environment where I get more sinful impressions on my mind, I have less chance of rising out of it.\n\nEven those people who are disadvantaged by their environment — those who are put in a society that does not give them the equal right to achieve what they try to achieve — can still rise above that. Triya Vaishya Tatakshudra. Interestingly, the Vaishyas never complained about this verse. Only two groups complain. Vaishya didn't say why we are included in it as well.\n\nWe are higher than you now. All business people are worshipped now, not Kshatriyas and Brahmanas. So Bhagawan says that at the time of Mahabharata, Vaishyas were not considered as high as the Brahmins and Kshatriyas. I heard when I was growing up. Which profession you are supposed to take?\n\nUttam Kheti Keti Farming. Madhyam Vyapa and Kanishta Nokri. The worst is you want to work for somebody is Kanishta. We all work for corporate and feel great about it. If you can't do farming then only you do Vaipa. So they were considered lower in that society.\n\nNow today in India, if you tell someone to become a farmer — how many farmers are committing suicide? Why would you want me to do farming? But in that society, Kshatriyas were farmers. Janakaraj, when he was tilling his land, found Sita. Kshatriyas, the kings, were themselves landlords and farmers.\n\nSo those people in that environment had a great chance to uplift themselves by getting this knowledge. But others did not have those equal rights. Women, Vaishya, Kshudra. But even they can get this knowledge and come to me. But you are a Mahabaho. You are the mighty armed person who has all the opportunities and all the prerequisites to know this.\n\nSo Bhuya Eva Mahabaho again. Listen to my very important words. I think you have come to a level that you are understanding what I'm saying. Manmana Bhava Madh Bhakta Madhya ji Mam namaskaru. I heard Obama saying the other day, stay focused. Don't get distracted by the protesters.\n\nDon't get distracted by your doubts in your mind. Bhagavan says Paramam vacha yate aham Priyamanaya. And I'm only telling those people who likes to listen to this type of knowledge. Vakshyami Hitakami Ayyaa. Because I wish welfare for you all. And therefore I'm telling you.\n\nSo what I'm telling you is what we had started in the last chapter saying. What is the royal secret? Aham Adhi Devanam Maharshinam Chasarva Sah. Neither the Devas in the heavens nor the great Rishis know my origin. What is the source of my being? Not on the great Rishis, not the Devas.\n\nBecause even in Puranas, Devas have their own limitations. Devas are considered pretty greedy. They want to have everything. Devas, they don't know. And Rishis, they are distracted by their own intellect. See, when we learn something, we get to a level where our intellect will become an obstacle.\n\nWe can't experience it because we keep doubting ourselves. So Bhagavan says, even they don't know. Because the source of the Deva and Rishis is me. Swami Dheerananda's very famous example. Batteries in the flashlight. If you're in a dark room and I have flashlight, I can see everything in the room.\n\nBut somebody says, what type of batteries are you using, Neil? I say, well, let me take it out. I take out the batteries. I put the batteries back. Light is back, but I can't see the batteries. I said, I don't know till tomorrow morning.\n\nSo the source of the light in the flashlight is the batteries. And therefore I cannot know through the light of the flashlight the type of batteries I'm using. Through my intellect, which is the Rishi, I cannot know the source of my being. I constantly try to contemplate through my intellect by deduction and inferences who I am. Bhagavan said, you will not know that the Rishis, our intellect, the knower, the seer in us is the Rishi. In the Devas are our sense perceptions.\n\nTo illumine something which is illuminated by my senses. So my senses are the Devas. Without them, the world is not existent for me. You remove the one sense of seeing. The world of sight is gone. You remove the hearing.\n\nThe world of sound is gone. You remove all five senses. The world is illuminated by my senses. So they are Devas through my senses. I am trying to find Bhagavan. I want to see Bhagavan.\n\nI want to see the presence of Bhagavan. In the laboratory, when somebody dies, what happens? Where is that atma is going? The people have done experiments of people dying. And what is it that leaving they cannot find it simply because Bhagavan said, because I am the source of this Deva Dhanda, I am the source of your senses and your intellect. You will never be able to find me through this.\n\nBecause the instrument cannot find its own source. Bhagwan says, aham, Adhi Diwanam, Maharishi Nam Cha Sarvasa. I'm not available to any of those, to the sense perceptions or by intellectual inquiry. I'm only available by contemplation and identification. By identification that I will be able to find myself. Yom Ajam Anadim Chavaiyati.\n\nOne who knows that I am that I. Whichever way you apply it, when applied to the supreme, he is the God. Bhagawan says \"I\" — that includes everything.",
      "reflection": "Krishna declares that neither the celestial beings (Devas) nor the great sages (Maharishis) can fully comprehend His origin, for He is the source of them all. This teaching invites us to a profound humility: the instruments we use to understand reality - our senses and intellect - are themselves products of that supreme reality. Just as batteries in a flashlight cannot illuminate themselves, our mind and senses cannot fully grasp their own source. Yet knowing Him as \"unborn, beginningless, and Lord of the universe\" liberates us from delusion and all conceivable sin.\n\nConsider how you typically try to \"figure out\" the divine through analysis and reasoning. These verses suggest that intellectual understanding alone has limits - the knower cannot fully objectify its own source. Instead, Krishna offers this knowledge out of love (\"priyamanaya\" - to one who is dear) and for our welfare (\"hitakamyaya\"). Today, practice approaching spiritual understanding not as a puzzle to solve, but as a relationship to deepen. When you encounter something beyond your comprehension - a moment of unexpected grace, an inexplicable feeling of peace, the mystery of consciousness itself - instead of immediately trying to analyze it, allow yourself to simply rest in not-knowing.\n\nAsk yourself: \"How would my daily life change if I truly accepted that my mind cannot fully grasp its own source? What would it mean to approach the divine with the heart of a beloved, rather than only the intellect of an investigator?\""

      "commentary": "We have been discussing Chapter 10, Vibhuti Yoga, Yoga of Divine Glories. We have seen so far that Bhagavan is immanent as well as transcendental. Bhagavan is immanent because he resides in the hearts of all beings — Ishvara Sarva Bhutanam Hrideshe Arjuna Tishtathi. Ishvara is residing in the hearts of all beings, therefore immanent. But he's also transcendental because we do not recognize him.\n\nThis chapter started out by Bhagavan saying in the second verse, I am not known to anyone. Neither the Devas, the divine beings or the divine senses, know me, nor the Great Rishis know me. He is not known by the mind or the intellect. By applying the normal tools of my cognition, I cannot know Ishvara. Therefore he is transcendental. So these two aspects of Bhagavan we have to overcome, in a sense, to know Him.\n\nWe have to find altar of meditation. We have completed the first segment of Karma Yoga, culminated in a Dhyana Yoga to meditate upon that supreme Self, my true Self. But what to meditate upon is what we have been discussing since last three chapters 7, 8 and 9. And Bhagawan in various ways told us what his real nature is that I am all pervading. Everything is strung into me. There is no reality other than me.\n\nBut it's still difficult for us to meditate on those aspects of Bhagavan. So the Vibhuti Yoga, the glories of the Lord, are required to meditate upon, to focus on. Something which I can identify through the limited means that I have, is my mind and intellect. So in this chapter, the Bhagavan is giving us the Vibhuti, that which I can identify and vouch for his presence. It is something like when I am in a deep sleep at night and wake up suddenly if I really want to know whether the sun is outside or not. That means, is it a day or not?\n\nWhen I open my windows and I see sunlight, I do not see the sun, but I see sunlight. The presence of sunlight tells me that sun has risen. The sun is there outside. I may not be able to see sun for various reasons. Maybe a building is blocking my view, maybe so bright that I cannot see it. But the very fact that I can experience the sunlight, it tells me that sun has risen.\n\nIn the same way, if I know the Vibhutis Sri Bhagawan says, if you can identify the qualities which emanate from me, which are my real qualities, then you should be able to vouch for my presence. The Lord resides in all hearts, in all beings, in all things. But I cannot vouch for it right now. So Bhagawan is giving us the tools to realize his presence. So in verse 3, Bhagavan concluded Yomam Ajam Anadim, Chaviti, Loka Maheshwaram. I am not known to the Devas.\n\nI am also not known to the Rishis, the great sages. I am not known through intellect nor I am known through mind. However, if one knows that I am Ajam Anadim, I am the source of all being. I am birthless and beginningless. It is uncaused, caused, then it is birthless. There is nothing before me.\n\nTherefore there is nothing is causing my existence. And also I'm beginningless because there's nothing before me. Loka Maheshwaram, the Lord of all the entire creation is there because of me. Because of the entity which is beginningless and birthless, the entire Jagat exists, the Bhagavan, the Lord Ishvara is the material cause and efficient cause for this Jagat. When he created this universe out of his own Maya, there was no other material available to him. From his own self, from his own qualities.\n\nHe provided the material as well as the knowledge, the efficient cause to create this Jagat. So the creation, if it all comes out of he is the Loka Maheshram. He is the Lord of all the beings. Lord is the one on whom my existence depends. So my Lord is my own consciousness. Without that, my existence as this limited being does not exist.\n\nThe day consciousness is not there, I will not be nil Bhatt. I'll be just a dead body. So Bhagavan said Asammudasam, the one who is not deluded by these appearances, he will be relieved of all the sins. In other words, all the ignorances, all the ignorant ideas that I have about myself as a limited being, I'll be liberated from. And then he enumerates those 20 qualities of the supreme Being, the divinity. These qualities in people, in things and beings, exist because of my presence. Those qualities are somewhat easy to understand.\n\nBuddhi, Gnanam, Asamoha, Shamah, Satyam, Damaha, Shamaha. Buddhi is intellect, Nischayatmika Buddhi — that which decides what is right and wrong. So when I feel that I'm exhibiting my Buddhi because I can decide it is day and not night, that's my Buddhi. Bhagavan says that because of my presence in you, this Buddhi exists in you at the microcosm. This Buddhi I use for deciding what's outside in this world. Gnanam — this Buddhi now gives me knowledge of what is real and what is unreal.\n\nAsammoha and non illusion. When I have Buddhi and I apply it to find out whether it is day outside or night, when I wake up, it gives me non illusion. Even though it was dark in my room, there is no difference between day and night in my room. But as soon as I open the window, I knew it's a day outside. That is because of my Buddhi that if there is sunlight outside, the sun has risen and therefore it is a day. So that created a Samohaha.\n\nNon-illusion, no delusion, no confusion. Out of these three, I develop other qualities such as Kshama (forgiveness), Satyam (truth), Damaha (control of the Indriyas), and Shamaha (control of the mind). We've seen in Tattva Bodh that Shamah is Mano Nigrahaha, and Damaha is control of the senses such as eyes and ears. Now, if I see that somebody is not yet convinced that it's day outside — even though I have concluded that it is day — if my wife doesn't agree with me, then I forgive her.\n\nI think she has not seen outside yet. Because of my knowledge, my Buddhi, my non-delusion, I can forgive other people who are still not at that level. She has not woken up completely. She cannot see the light outside — to her, it's still night. I can forgive her because of my knowledge.\n\nIf I have no knowledge, there will be confusion. We will be fighting about it. But because I have knowledge, I can have Kshama and I can vouch for the truth that it is day outside. I can control my actions and also my mind. All this emanates from the same source — my own consciousness at the vyashti, at the microcosm. I have all these exhibiting through me.\n\nBecause of that divinity, the consciousness functioning through me, I'm identifying with it. Sukham Dukham Bhavah Abhavah, Bhayam cha Abhayam eva cha. These are the pairs of opposites I have to deal with in this world — this world which I have created out of my own consciousness. In deep sleep, there was no world outside to deal with. There were no pairs of opposites.\n\nThere was no confusion about day or night. But as soon as I woke up and I have this Buddhi and Gnana exhibiting through me. Now I have to deal with this world outside which has pairs of opposites. So Kannadukha Bhava and Abhava. Existence and non existence, birth and death. Bhayam cha Bhayam Bhaya is a positive emotion which protects me from getting myself hurt.\n\nIf I have no Bhaya of jumping from a third floor window, then I'm going to hurt myself. So this fear of getting hurt is actually protecting me. So therefore it's a positive emotion. And Abhaya and fearlessness. Things which I am very sure about. I'll be fearless no matter what.\n\nSomebody tells me that I do not exist. So things which I so sure about my existence, I'm fearless. Things which I'm not sure about my existence. After my death, I'm fearful. I have fear of death because I have no idea what will happen after my death. I'm fearless about my existence right now.\n\nBecause I know who I am and how I exist exist. So there's both fear and fearlessness emanating from my identification with my consciousness. Ahimsa, non injury, Samatha, equanimity, Tusthi, contentment, Tapaha, disciplines, austerity, Dhanam, charity, Yashaha, Fame and also Ayyashaha ill fame. All these I experience because of my identification with myself as my conscious conscious being. These 20 qualities are given as the glories of that supreme Lord. These are the basic qualities through which he manifests in this world through beings.\n\nHe resides in the hearts of all the beings. And when those beings identify with him, these positive qualities are exhibited through them. Then what about the opposites of this? Like Hinsa, Abudhi, Agnana, Samoha. It is nothing but non identification with the self. When I identify with the Divinity within me, all these positive qualities of the divinity will be manifesting through me.\n\nWhen I'm not identifying with that divinity, then the lack of those qualities will be exhibiting. So the lack of qualities are not really any qualities. They are just lack of good qualities. Something similar to how there is nothing called cold — just a lack of heat. Heat I can identify as a form of energy, but cold has no form of energy.\n\nIt just lack of heat creates sensation of cold. Lack of Ahimsa creates Himsa. Lack of Buddhi creates Abuddhi — one who doesn't know anything. Lack of knowledge creates ignorance. So the negatives which we see in this world is because of non identification with the true self. Bhagavan said this entire Jagat is created by my own mind using my own self as the material.\n\nMy Maya is the material, therefore he is the Loka Maheshwaram. Without him no world is possible. Without you being conscious of your world, your world cannot exist. Without me being conscious of my world, my world does not exist. And therefore he, the Supreme Lord who is functioning through all beings as their consciousness. He is the Lord of all all the beings.\n\nSo he is justifying why he is Loka, Maheshwaram, Bhavanti, Bhava, Bhutana, Mata Eva, Pruthakvida. These varieties of expressions you see in this world through various beings with all these qualities in the various levels, this permutation combinations, all these 20 qualities creates this multitude of personalities in this world. Somebody has more Buddhi, somebody has more Kshama, somebody has more Ahimsa. All these manifestations in this world through beings. But anytime I see the expression of any of these qualities, I must know that divinity is present in that being. Bhavanti Bhava Bhutanam Mata Eva Prithak Vidhaha.\n\nAll these different kinds of qualities of being arise from me alone. Without that one common thread which we call it consciousness, life, none of these are possible. And therefore we should know when we see these qualities that the Lord is present. And therefore when we meet each other, when we see the exhibition of any of these qualities, we have to do Namaste that I see the divinity in you is emanating through you as kindness. All these qualities are nothing but the glories of the Lord and Bhagawan. Meditate on those glories.\n\nThese are your means, the tools for you to meditate on the divine self that you are. Then Bhagavan concludes by giving a complete picture of the creation. Maharsayah, Saptapurve, Chatvarohu, Manamahata, Madbhava Manasa Jata, Esam, Loka, Imah, Prajaha.",
      "reflection": "These verses reveal twenty divine qualities that emanate from the Lord's presence: Buddhi (intellect), Jnana (wisdom), Asamoha (non-delusion), Kshama (forgiveness), Satya (truth), Dama (sense-control), Shama (mind-control), Sukha and Dukha (pleasure and pain), Bhava and Abhava (birth and death), Bhaya and Abhaya (fear and fearlessness), Ahimsa (non-injury), Samata (equanimity), Tushti (contentment), Tapa (austerity), Dana (charity), Yasha and Ayasha (fame and ill-fame). Each of these exists in beings only because of the divine presence within. When we see someone display wisdom, forgiveness, or fearlessness, we are witnessing the Lord's light shining through that individual.\n\nThe teaching also clarifies something crucial: negative qualities are simply the absence of these positive divine expressions. Just as cold is not a thing in itself but merely the absence of heat, ignorance is the absence of knowledge, cruelty is the absence of compassion. This understanding transforms how we view both ourselves and others - rather than seeing \"bad\" as a positive force, we recognize it as non-identification with our divine nature. Today, when you encounter any of these twenty qualities in yourself or others - a moment of genuine forgiveness, an act of charity, a flash of wisdom - pause and recognize: \"This is divinity expressing itself.\"\n\nReflect on these questions: \"Which of these twenty qualities do I most naturally express? Which ones feel distant from me? Can I see even difficult emotions like fear or the experience of loss as part of the divine tapestry of existence, present only because consciousness is present?\""

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 10, Vibhuti Yoga, the Lord's Vibhuti, that one which appears to be many is His Vibhuti. By his power of Yoga he appears to us as many. So you go to the jewelry shop, the gold is gold, but the Vibhuti of gold with all the jewelries you see, that's the glory of the gold you see in the jewelry shop. And the yogic power is the jeweler who is the yogic power, that efficient cause with which he creates many out of this one gold. So Bhagavan said that I am the source of all the beings in this chapter, but says not many people can realize that. Even the Rishis, Maharisis and the Devas Sura Ganaha, even they cannot recognize that.\n\nThe reason being that I am the source of even those who we consider to be the higher beings, such as Sura Ganaha and Mahari says, and therefore the effect cannot find its own source. All this Saptarisis, sanat, Kumaras and 14 Manus, they're all born out of my mind. In other words, anything which you consider is the source of your being, source of your human race or your existence, all came out of me, born out of my mind. And after that, all the progeny of those are also me. However, it appears to us as many because of our own ignorance about our own self. Now the goal is to unwind that clock from where we started and reached to this point of ignorance and remove that ignorance.\n\nSo, Aham Sarvasya Prabhavah, Matta Sarva Pravartate, Iti Matva Bhajante Mam Budhaha Bhava Samanvitaha — but one whose intellect is steady, Bhava Samanvitaha, they will see me as the source of all the beings. Everything is pervaded by me. With such understanding and such devotion, one who worships me, they obviously will get me. And then: Macchitta Madgat Pranah Bodhayantah Parasparam Kathayantash cha Mam Nityam Tushyanti cha Ramanti cha.\n\nWhat we don't have in our life is contentment and delight. Our life is full of discontent and dejection. One of the Swamijis used to say, our life is like the cardiogram: unhappiness, unhappiness, little happiness, unhappiness, little happiness.\n\nThat's the story of our life. What we're seeking is exactly the contentment. I want to be satisfied, I want to be content. I want to have bliss. Then I want to enjoy my life. That's what we are looking for.\n\nAnd everything we have tried so far in our life has its own limitation. So that is what we are lacking. Bhagavan says the only people who achieve this are Macchitaha — those whose mind is absorbed in me. In other words, I have come to the conclusion that the Lord is the source of all being. And we have seen from the logic of spirituality that this world was created by God, using the only material available to him, which is his own self.\n\nYou and I cannot be anything different than his own self. With that understanding, if my mind is resting in him always, anything I see, anything I feel, anything I touch is nothing but his self. Machittaha Madgat Pranaha — everything that is happening with my life, my Prana. Swamiji takes a much wider view of Prana: any experience which I have through my sense organs is nothing but his experience alone.\n\nBecause I have come to the firm conclusion that this world could not have been created out of anything but God's own self. There is no other material available to him to create this world but his own self. We constantly remind each other that you and I are nothing but the Lord's own self. It reminds me of a kind of practical joke. When I was in the Dallas group, a lot of Americans who were involved in what I do said, \"Neel, I noticed something. You guys always say, 'Hari Om.'\"\n\nIn Chinmaya Mission we meet each other and say, \"Hari Om.\" But he heard it as \"hurry home.\" He said, \"I know now why you guys have a better family life. You remind each other constantly. Your wife must be waiting.\n\nNeel, go home, otherwise you'll be in trouble. You remind each other, hurry home. Then you won't have any trouble.\" But the real meaning of Bodhayantaha Parasparam is that we constantly remind each other and enlighten others that there is no other self in you or in me but the same self. That's why Namaste means \"I bow down to you\" — the same self which is in me is in you.\n\nBodhayantaha Parasparam Kathayantash cha Mam Nityam — constantly speaking about me, constantly reminding ourselves in all our actions that everything happening in my life, every experience that I'm experiencing, is nothing but the Lord's glory alone. Tushyanti cha Ramanti cha — they're content and they're reveling in their own self. Swamiji makes an elaborate distinction between Kridanti and Ramanti. Krida requires an outside object to interact with — to play a ball or whatever. Ramanti is reveling in yourself; by yourself you're enjoying. That is Ramanti.\n\nSo the two things we always are lacking is this contentment and the joy. Bhagavan said, you can only get by your mind constantly focused on the self. All your activities are devoted to the self. Reminding, enlightening each other that we are the manifestation of the same Lord. And then Kathayanti cha — speaking about that will lead you to contentment and enjoyment. Dadami Buddhi Yogam Tam Yena Mam Upayanti Te.\n\nThose who do what we have discussed in the previous verse — Bhagawan says, now what is my job? Tesham Satata Yuktanam Bhajatam Priti Purvakam Dadami Buddhi Yogam Tam Yena Mam Upayanti Te. I give them Buddhi Yoga. Those who are doing what we just discussed — constantly focusing their mind on the self, all their activities dedicated to the self, enlightening each other and speaking about it — they're content.\n\nBecause Bhagavan said, I give them Buddhi Yoga. Now, Buddhi Yoga is not this Buddhi that we know as part of Mana, Buddhi, Chitta, Ahankara. That Buddhi is used to decipher the world of objects. With this intellect I try to decide my experiences — whether this is right or that is right — and I come to a conclusion.\n\nSo that is the ordinary Buddhi. But this is Yogic Buddhi. Buddhi we associate with knowing something. Becoming firmly convicted about something is Buddhi. Waffling is the mind — I like, I dislike.\n\nI know, I don't know, this or that. Once I decisively know, that's Buddhi. In this case, I now decisively know what my self is. There is no doubt left in my mind anymore. Up till now I had a doubt: what is my relationship with the Lord?\n\nIs he really looking after me or not? Well, I'm doing his puja — does he know that I'm doing his puja? Therefore, make sure that we publish it in Bharadwani that I did Lakshmi Puja. \"Lord, you know that it was published in Bharadwani. Now it's your responsibility.\" Bhagavan said, I give them that Buddhi which gives you that contentment and joy.\n\nTe Yena Mam Upayanti Te. With that Buddhi Yoga they come to me. Our journey started from when we separated from ourselves by ignorance and started thinking, \"This is me, this body is me, this mind is me, this intellect is me.\" And now at my age, I realize that not only this body which I was born with and then grew out of food, but the steel plate in my leg and the acrylic lens in my eye is also \"me.\" No difference between the lens I was born with. I actually asked my ophthalmologist.\n\nI said, doesn't it come with a lifetime warranty? He said, no, it doesn't. I said, how about this one? He said, this has a limited warranty too. All that I consider me turns out to be something I have borrowed from this world. Bhagavan said, once that awareness takes place that there is nothing but the self exists.\n\nYou know there is nothing but \"I\" that exists. That parallax is now removed between my lower self and the higher self. Tesham Eva Anukampartham Aham Ajnana Jam Tamah Nashayami Atma Bhavastho Jnana Dipena Bhasvata.\n\nSo now it seems like Bhagavan is doing all that very partially — only for those who put in all this effort. And he really doesn't care about people like us who are constantly busy with our business and our studies and our professions. But Bhagavan is ever compassionate, and all religions say that, including Christianity.\n\nBhagawan is never considered as one who is harshly judging people. He's ever compassionate, but he has his own limitations. Unless I seek his compassion, he does not have the power to shower his compassion on me. Let's say I have five children and four of them never talk to me — only one talks to me. My compassion is only revealed to the one who is constantly with me. The other four have never experienced my compassion because they never allowed me to show it to them.\n\nSwamiji gives another example. That sun is always compassionate to give you sunlight. But as long as I keep the windows closed, he doesn't have any power to give you compassion. He has to patiently wait outside your window till you allow him to come inside your room by opening the windows. Then he can shower his compassion by giving you the light. It is us where we have to become worthy of his compassion.\n\nSo Bhagawan said, Tesham — those we just talked about, all the qualities they have achieved. Tesham Eva Anukampartham Aham Ajnana Jam Tamah. What has made me feel different from my own self, from God? My own ignorance. The self is self-effulgent. It has its own revelation. It becomes revealed to you by its own glory.\n\nMyself, I'm always aware. Under whatever condition, I know I exist. That requires no intellectual conviction or intellectual argument about whether I exist or not. Everything else requires my intellectual conclusion. Am I an architect or a doctor? I come to the conclusion I cannot be anything but an architect.\n\nI never went to medical school. So all these things which my upadhi requires — my intellectual conclusion that \"this is who I am\" — but \"I exist\" requires no intellectual argument. It reveals to me that I exist, in my awareness. So Bhagavan says, what has removed you from that revelation that yourself and the God-self are one? Your ignorance, created by identification with the non-self — my body, my mind, my intellect — that created an avarana, a veiling, over my understanding that I exist.\n\nAnd that veiling once removed, no other efforts are required. Swamiji uses a very good example. I'm looking for my key in the room and the key is lying on the table. But the room is pitch dark. Obviously I can't find my key. But somebody with his compassion turned the lights on.\n\nWith that compassion of turning the light on, now the light shines on my key and I see my key. The person didn't have to produce a key. Just out of compassion, he removes the darkness in the room and I find my key. In the same way, Bhagawan said, the self was always dwelling in my own heart.\n\nIt is always revealing that I exist. But I consider that \"I\" to be this limited \"I\" — the existence which I feel all the time, I now take it for granted. It is talking about my body, my mind, my intellect, my achievement, my position, my relationship. That's \"I.\" Bhagawan said, with the destruction of this ignorance by all the things which we have talked about, I remove that darkness by lighting up the Jnana Dipa, the light of knowledge, in your heart.\n\nAnd you come to this revelation that my existence is of that supreme self.",
      "reflection": "These verses describe the blessed state of those who truly understand Krishna's Vibhuti and Yoga: \"Macchitta Madgata-pranah\" - minds absorbed in Me, lives dedicated to Me. Such devotees enlighten each other (Bodhayantah parasparam), constantly speak of the divine (Kathayantah), and experience both contentment (Tushyanti) and joy (Ramanti). Notice how this spiritual path is not solitary - it involves mutual enlightenment and shared discourse. The greeting \"Hari Om\" or \"Namaste\" is not mere social courtesy but a constant reminder: the divine in me recognizes the divine in you.\n\nThe distinction between Kridanti (playing with external objects) and Ramanti (reveling within oneself) is profound. Our usual happiness depends on external conditions - we need something outside ourselves to enjoy. But the devotee described here experiences Ramanti - a self-contained joy that needs nothing external. This contentment comes from the firm conviction: \"I am the source of all; from Me everything flows\" (Aham sarvasya prabhavah). When this understanding moves from intellectual assent to lived experience, the endless seeking stops.\n\nToday, practice \"Bodhayantah parasparam\" - mutual enlightenment. Share a spiritual insight with someone, or ask about their understanding. Notice how speaking about truth deepens your own grasp of it. And throughout the day, when happiness comes, ask: \"Is this Krida - dependent on something external? Or can I touch that Ramanti - the joy of simply being?\" What would it mean for your life to be truly \"Madgata-prana\" - your very life-breath dedicated to recognizing the divine in all?"

Tesham Eva Anukampartham Aham Ajnana Jam Tamah. What has made me feel different from my own self, from God? My own ignorance. The self is self-effulgent. It has its own revelation. It becomes revealed to you by its own glory.\n\nMyself, I'm always aware. Under whatever condition, I know I exist. That requires no intellectual conviction or intellectual argument about whether I exist or not. Everything else requires my intellectual conclusion. Am I an architect or a doctor? I come to the conclusion I cannot be anything but an architect.\n\nI never went to medical school. So all these things which my upadhi requires — my intellectual conclusion that \"this is who I am\" — but \"I exist\" requires no intellectual argument. It reveals to me that I exist, in my awareness. So Bhagavan says, what has removed you from that revelation that yourself and the God-self are one? Your ignorance, created by identification with the non-self — my body, my mind, my intellect — that created an avarana, a veiling, over my understanding that I exist.\n\nAnd that veiling once removed, no other efforts are required. Swamiji uses a very good example. I'm looking for my key in the room and the key is lying on the table. But the room is pitch dark. Obviously I can't find my key. But somebody with his compassion turned the lights on.\n\nWith that compassion of turning the light on, now the light shines on my key and I see my key. The person didn't have to produce a key. Just out of compassion, he removes the darkness in the room and I find my key. In the same way, Bhagawan said, the self was always dwelling in my own heart.\n\nIt is always revealing that I exist. But I consider that \"I\" to be this limited \"I\" — the existence which I feel all the time, I now take it for granted. It is talking about my body, my mind, my intellect, my achievement, my position, my relationship. That's \"I.\" Bhagawan said, with the destruction of this ignorance by all the things which we have talked about, I remove that darkness by lighting up the Jnana Dipa, the light of knowledge, in your heart.\n\nAnd you come to this revelation that my existence is of that supreme self.",
      "reflection": "The Lord makes a remarkable promise here: \"Dadami Buddhi-yogam tam\" - I give them the Yoga of discrimination. This is not ordinary intellectual sharpness but a special faculty that connects us back to our source. And crucially, this gift comes to those who worship \"Priti-purvakam\" - with love, not mere duty. The image of the sun waiting patiently outside a closed window beautifully illustrates divine grace: it is ever-present, but we must open ourselves to receive it. God's compassion is unconditional, but our receptivity determines what we experience.\n\nArjuna's response reveals a transformed understanding. He addresses Krishna with profound titles: Param Brahma (Supreme Absolute), Param Dhama (Supreme Abode), Pavitram Paramam (Supreme Purifier), Purusham Shashvatam (Eternal Being), Adi-devam (Primal God), Ajam (Unborn), Vibhum (All-pervading). This is not flattery but recognition - Arjuna has moved from confusion to clarity, from seeing Krishna as merely his friend and charioteer to recognizing him as the Supreme Reality. Such recognition transforms relationship - we cannot treat casually what we truly revere.\n\nToday, practice opening your windows to divine grace. Where have you kept the shutters closed - through doubt, distraction, or simply forgetting? The Buddhi-yoga promised here is not earned through effort alone but received through loving devotion combined with consistent practice. Ask yourself: \"What would it look like to worship 'with love' rather than obligation? Where in my life am I seeking confirmation from the outside world rather than trusting the light of knowledge that dwells within my own heart?\""

      "commentary": " Shri Purohit Swami did not comment on this sloka\n\nWe had been discussing chapter 10, Vibhuti Yoga, Yoga of Divine Glory. In the first six chapters. Chapter two gave us the real indicator of who we are. The paradigm shift in chapter two was you are not the mortal being, but you are the immortal being having mortal equipment. As long as you identify with your mortal equipment, you are mortal. But if you identify with immortal being, you are immortal.\n\nThe quest of my life is to exist, and therefore the only remedy is to identify with the immortal being, not with the mortal equipment. The remaining segment of the first six chapters dealt with actions, because actions are the unit of my interface with this world. So the first six chapters give us the pluralistic view of the world and myself. The segment ended with Dhyana Yoga, Yoga of Contemplation, Meditation. How do I now change my worldview from pluralistic to singularistic? The technique is meditation, but then what to meditate upon will be the next six chapters, 7 to 12, which is that \"Tat\" aspect of Tattvamasi.\n\nThere are four Mahavakyas we have seen before in the Upanishads. One is Prajnanam Brahma — Consciousness is Brahman. That's the very first. The next is Ayam Atma Brahma.\n\nSo if consciousness is Brahman, then my Atma is Brahman — my consciousness is Brahman. The next one says Tattvamasi — \"That thou art,\" that which you are seeking as immortal existence is you, is your own self. And the last one is Aham Brahmasmi. Once that realization takes place, it's \"Oh, I am that consciousness.\" The Gita is an elaboration on the third, which is Tattvamasi. So the \"Tat\" — that which I consider right now something other than me, Bhagavan is somebody other than me.\n\nI know all my limitations, all my papas and punyas. Bhagavan has none of those. So he's something other than me. That is described in chapters 7 to 12. The seventh chapter was Jnana Vijnana Yoga — Yoga of Knowledge and its application. Vijnana is Vishishta Jnana, applied knowledge.\n\nWhen it's applied, it becomes Vijnana. So in Jnana Vijnana Yoga we got a glimpse of reality — that there are two ways to look at it. One is the pluralistic view, the other the singularistic view. When we look at the pluralistic, it's called Prakriti, the world of the manifested universe.\n\nAs we know, where I exist, he exists, it exists, and everything else exists. That's the world of Prakriti. But that is my lower Prakriti, because you can perceive, feel, and experience it through your senses. Therefore it's the lower Prakriti. Other than that is my higher Prakriti, which is unmanifested.\n\nThe higher Prakriti cannot be perceived through your senses. So he said, there are two Prakritis. The source of all the beings and things in this world are these two Prakritis — these two natures, higher and lower. Whether you look at it from a singularistic way or a pluralistic way. That was chapter seven.\n\nChapter eight was Imperishable Brahman. How do I recognize that imperishable Brahman, that which is the source of all beings? He says, Aham Kṛtsnasya Jagadaha — I am the source of all the things and beings. How do I recognize that the self is imperishable? That is given in chapter 8. Chapter 9 was Rajavidya Rajaguhya Yoga, the Yoga of the Royal Secret.\n\nThe secret is the relationship — the \"relation-less\" relationship I have with that source. Bhagavan said, I am not in them, but they are in me. All the things and beings which we perceive, feel, touch, interact, and react with in this world — Bhagawan said, they are in me, I am not in them. Which is totally contrary to what we have heard all our life from our childhood.\n\nBhagavan is in every being. Bhagavan is in your heart, my heart, his heart. Bhagawan says, no, I am not anywhere. They are all in me, but I am not in them. He also turned around and said, but they are also not in me. So it is something for us to contemplate.\n\nHow can that relationship exist where he is not in me, but I am in him, but I am also not in him? So the analogy we had used before to understand this: space in a car. Is the space in the car, or is the car in the space? BMW or Mercedes — is the space in the car, or is the car in the space? We clearly know space is in the car. \"We have already four people. We don't have space in my car.\"\n\nBut if that's the case, what happened to the space which was in the car when it was manufactured in Germany and sealed tight and transported to United States? What happened to the German space? Did I bring it with me or we left it in Germany? Well, the answer is obviously we didn't import space, we only imported the car. So car must be in this space. Space cannot be in the car.\n\nCar moved in the space. And now if you consider that this space and the car are made up of the same entity called nothingness, then space can say, car is not in me. See, we have difficulty understanding this because we think this is solid world of matter and the space is no matter. But scientists have been trying to find a solid matter in this world and they have not been successful so far. First we thought that you need a matter atom. Then we found out atom is nothing but a hole of space.\n\nThere's nothing in it other than electrons and protons. The nucleus must be a solid material. They found out that's not solid either. We are yet to find any solid material anywhere in this universe. So if you consider that both the car and the space are made up of the same material, then space can say, \"Car is not in me.\" So Bhagavan said, I am not in them, they are in me.\n\nThe beings as they perceive, they are in my own self. They are there because of me. If I am not there, they are not there. But they are also not there. Because I have never changed into these beings. Therefore they are also not in me.\n\nThat's my relation-less relationship with my Lord. How do I recognize it? As we discussed in chapter nine. But now I'm more confused. Arjuna said, \"What do I contemplate? I cannot contemplate on nothingness.\"\n\nAs I said, in architecture, the first exercise was how to perceive space. So if you take space and remove everything out of this space, you cannot perceive space, only perceive space in the relationship of objects. There are two objects in architecture. We used to say we created three spaces. Two positive space and one negative space in between. And that's how you now perceive positive, negative, positive.\n\nRemove the positive, and the negative goes away. There is nothing to perceive. So this is my dilemma. People are telling me Bhagavan is everywhere, Bhagavan is everything. But how do I relate to him?\n\nSo chapter 10 is Vibhuti Yoga, Yoga of the Divine Glories. How do I see the divine glories in my world of plurality and contemplate on the singularity? That is chapter 10. In the beginning of the chapter, Bhagawan said, do not try with your intellect or your senses. Na Me Vidhuh Sura Ganaha — even the Devas do not know me, nor the Rishis. The Devas are our Indriyas.\n\nThat which is illuminating this world for me is my Devas. This world is illuminated by my senses — my world of sight, my world of sound, my world of touch. With that capability, I cannot be known. Nor can the Maha Rishis know me. By Rishis is meant my intellect — by my thought process of inferring knowledge, even that's not possible. The intellect is not capable.\n\nMy senses are not capable. So Bhagavan said, I will tell you how you should contemplate on me. He said, Aham Sarvasya Prabhava, Mattaha Sarva Pravartate — start thinking first that I pervade everywhere, I am the source of all being. And Mattaha Sarva Pravartate, Iti Matva Bhajante Mam Budhaha Bhava Samanvitaha.\n\nThus, whoever contemplates on me is a wise person, one endowed with loving consciousness. He will start with this very notion that he is the source of all being. We will have great difficulty if the president of our country is not to our liking and we are told he is also Krishna's manifestation. Bhagawan said, you have to overcome that. If you don't overcome that, you have failed at the starting line.\n\nYou have to overcome that. Iti Matva Bhajante Mam Priti Purvakam Bhava Samanvitaha. With a loving consciousness — right now I divide my world into the world I love and the world I hate. Bhagawan says, if you want to know me, this world cannot be divided, because it's only me. I cannot hate part of me. I cannot love my right leg and hate my left leg.\n\nMy left leg is as important as the right one, even though it's broken. They say, if I develop that sense, then only will you be able to know me. So Bhagawan gave that thumbnail sketch of how people can come to Macchittaha Madgat Pranaha Bodhayantaha Parasparam. You try to do it by yourself — you may be motivated for a few days. After that you will recede into what you were doing before.\n\nTherefore, it is very important to have Bodhayantaha Parasparam — reinforce this idea in each other. Satsanga, the glory of Satsanga. This cannot be done by yourself. Gita cannot be read in one sitting. You can't sit down and say, \"I learned Gita.\" When Swamiji used to come, people would say, \"Swamiji, we have gone through the Gita.\"\n\nSwamiji used to say, \"Has the Gita gone through you?\" So it is very essential that we keep up our enthusiasm about knowing Bhagawan. We are very easy to drop off. Somebody once said, \"I finally understood the difference between two worldviews.\" He said the basic difference is that one group starts with saying that human beings are basically bad, and you have to improve them. Their goal is: they start out bad, you have to improve them.\n\nThe other group says human beings are basically good; they are victims of situations, and we have to help them. That's the big difference in worldview. So they're very similar to what we say about the Hindu view and certain other religious views. Some religions start with the premise that the human being is a sinner who must be redeemed. Hinduism says the human being is an immortal, divine being, and you have to purify him if there is impurity on him.\n\nSo Bhagavan here says, whether you start from evil or good, there is a very good possibility of impurities superimposing on you and dampening your enthusiasm. The only way you can make sure is Parasparam Bodhayantaha — because we see our world through others' eyes. If others approve what you are doing, we feel good about it. No matter how sure I am that I am doing good, if others don't approve, I won't feel good about it.\n\nTwo people were working in a warehouse, painting the high trusses. They are lazily leaning against each other while painting. One fell down, so the other also fell down. Luckily they fell in a heap of garbage, so they were not hurt. They got up and looked at each other. One's face was completely dirty, the other's was miraculously clean.\n\nThe guy whose face was clean went to the bathroom, washed his face, then went to work. The guy whose face was dirty didn't bother — he went straight to work. Why? They looked at each other. The clean-faced guy said, \"His face is dirty, mine must be dirty too.\" The dirty-faced guy said, \"His face is clean, mine must be clean too. Let me go and start working.\"",
      "reflection": "Arjuna now confirms his faith by citing authorities: the great sages, divine seers like Narada, Asita, Devala, and Vyasa have all declared this truth. His statement \"Sarvam etat ritam manye\" - \"I accept all this as truth\" - marks a crucial transition from hearing to believing. Yet Arjuna adds something profound: \"Svayam eva atmana atmanam vettha tvam\" - \"You alone know Yourself by Yourself.\" No external authority can fully reveal the divine; ultimately, the Self knows the Self. Even the greatest teachers can only point; realization is direct and intimate.\n\nThe verse also highlights the importance of Satsanga - spiritual companionship. We see the world through others' eyes; if our companions approve of spiritual seeking, we feel encouraged. The story of the two workers who fell into garbage illustrates this perfectly - each judged his own face by looking at the other's. In spiritual life, we need fellow seekers who reflect back to us our higher nature, not our limitations. This is why \"Bodhayantah parasparam\" - mutually enlightening each other - is so essential. Alone, our enthusiasm fades; together, we sustain the fire.\n\nToday, reflect on your sources of spiritual authority. Who are the \"Naradas and Vyasas\" in your life - the teachers, texts, and companions whose wisdom you trust? And recognize that while external confirmation matters, the ultimate knowing must come from within. Ask yourself: \"Do I seek truth to genuinely understand, or merely to collect intellectual concepts? Who in my life supports my highest aspirations? Am I that kind of friend to others?\""

      "reflection": "Arjuna's request here is deeply practical: \"Tell me Your divine manifestations (Vibhutayah) by which You pervade these worlds.\" He understands the teaching intellectually but needs concrete pointers for meditation. His question \"Katham vidyam aham\" - \"How shall I know You?\" - acknowledges that knowing about God is different from experiencing God's presence. The formless is difficult to contemplate; the mind needs hooks, anchors, tangible reference points. This is not spiritual weakness but honest acknowledgment of how human consciousness works.\n\nMost striking is Arjuna's declaration: \"Truptir hi shrinvato nasti me amritam\" - \"I am never satiated listening to Your nectar-like words.\" This insatiable thirst for spiritual knowledge marks the true seeker. Unlike ordinary desires that diminish with fulfillment, spiritual hunger grows the more it is fed. Each insight creates capacity for deeper insight; each experience of truth creates longing for more. This is the nature of approaching the infinite - there is always more.\n\nToday, practice Arjuna's approach: bring your honest questions to your spiritual practice. What specific pointers would help you recognize the divine in your daily experience? Notice whether your engagement with spiritual teachings feels like obligation or genuine thirst. If the fire seems dim, perhaps you need fresh fuel - new questions, new perspectives, renewed wonder. Ask yourself: \"Am I approaching spirituality as a subject to master or a mystery to explore? What would it take to feel genuine, insatiable curiosity about the nature of reality?\""

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 10, Vibhuti Yoga, Yoga of Divine Glories. So far, up to chapters one through nine, we came to one conclusion: that everything comes out of one single entity and everything is pervaded by him. Over and over Bhagavan said that you should focus on that entity which is permanent, that which never changes. Along with all the changes happening in this Sansar, everything is constantly changing — including my body, my mind, my intellect. But they're part of the Prakriti.\n\nBut as long as you identify with this unchanging reality which is all pervading and the source of all the beings, then thou shall be liberated from all your sorrows and limitations. So Arjuna, like all of us, says that I intellectually appreciate this. Many, many Rishis have said this, and now you are also telling me the same thing. But how do I contemplate upon that single entity is still not clear to me. Intellectually appreciating that he is everywhere is one thing, and when encounter a situation which is unconducive, to keep that thought steady in your mind is another thing. And that's why Arjuna said I am having difficulty.\n\nI cannot conceptualize in my mind what is that all pervading entity is all about. You need to give me some pointers. Something which I can tangibly can relate to, which I can conceptualize in my mind, in my meditation, in my contemplation, where I can hang on to that entity as the divine entity, as the one all pervading entity. And then I may make some progress. So tell me all your glories without leaving anything behind, because I never get tired of listening to it. You tell me all these times.\n\nSo tell me what is it that I should be looking for in this universe which I can identify as your manifestation? Everything I see right now, even though I have understood, come very short of being divine. So what should I focus on? So in response to that, we have this next 22 verses which Bhagavan gives Various pointers to meditate upon. It is not very clear to us how to identify divinity. So Bhagavan said, you find divinity in everything that is best among their own spheres.\n\nSo Bhagavan starts his response by clarifying that we are not coming to any new conclusion now — that only the best is where I am, but not the rest. Verse 20 clearly makes a summary statement: let's not get deviated from what we already talked about, that I am the source of all the beings, Asheshena, without leaving anything out. But in some, this divinity may be more prominent to identify. So he says: Aham Atma Gudakesha Sarva Bhuta Ashayasthitah. Let's make it clear that I reside as the core of all the beings. There is no exception.\n\nJust because we say the one is more manifesting divinity and other is not, that does not mean the other is devoid of my presence. So very first clarification is I reside in all the beings as the core of their beings. Aham adhisha madhyacha bhutanam anta evacha. I am the origin, Adi middle and the end of all the beings. All the beings are part of the Prakriti. They have beginning and end.\n\nThey come from somewhere. They exist in time and space for a while and then they end. But all the time the source of that being is me. I am the one who sustained them during their existence. And I am the one they dissolve into. That you should never forget, Bhagavanji, even in your contemplation, that there is no exception.\n\nThere is nothing which can exist without my presence. But your question was: what to contemplate upon? How can I conceptualize the divinity, the self, which is all pervading and immortal? So I'll give you the pointers. As Swamiji says, in the next 21 verses Bhagawan gave 75 pointers. It is like something obvious we can identify with.\n\nWhen the lights are on in this room, we know the electricity is there. When lights were off, electricity was still here. It just was not available for my perception. The electricity always pervades in this room in all this electrical wiring. I can only prove when I show you the presence of it in some manifest form. So the manifest forms rest of the chapter talks about.\n\nAnd because it is given to Arjuna in his time, we obviously walk through several of these Vedic and Puranic references. If Krishna were talking today, he would say, \"I am the iPhone among all smartphones. I'm Google among all technology companies.\" We relate to things which are familiar to us, and therefore the analogies given are more in line with the culture at the time.\n\nAnd what Arjuna can identify with — he starts out from the higher, then comes down to the level which in day-to-day life Arjuna can identify with. Adityanam Aham Vishnuh — among the Adityas, I am Vishnu. Aditi's sons are the Adityas. As Swamiji points out, Aditi is mentioned in the Rig Veda. Aditi means limitless. Aditi is the mother of all celestial beings.\n\nLater, in Puranic time, Aditi was also shown as wife of Kashyap Rishi. But from the Vedic point of view, Aditi was the perennial mother, the primordial mother who gives birth to this universe. According to our scriptures and puranas, sometimes four Adityas are mentioned, sometimes six. But eventually they settled on 12 Adityas. When the word is used in the singular, it means Sun. When mentioned in the plural, it means the 12. The Adityas somewhat identify with the 12 months of the year; each one is in charge of one segment of the year. So among the Adityas, Bhagavan says I am Vishnu. Vishnu is all pervading. Vishnu means one who has long reach.\n\nYou can probably say that the one in charge of the longest day in the year is Vishnu. But basically, among all the celestial beings, what becomes very apparent to me is Vishnu because he is all pervading. Consider me as Vishnu among all Adityas. Jyotisham Ravihi Anshuman — among the luminaries in the sky, those objects or entities that are self-effulgent, I am the radiant Sun.\n\nSun is something obvious to us. But we can only relate to Sun. Among the luminaries in the sky, I am Sun. Marichihi Marutam Asmi among the winds, wind is air in different forms. It can be hurricane, it can be tornado, it can be storm or it can be a pleasant breeze. Marutas in plurality are in charge of all these different types of winds.\n\nNow obviously in Vedic time, we were reliant on the natural forces. Natural forces are something we are trying to understand. So each natural force is a deity. We came to one conclusion that if there is an activity, there is somebody in charge of the activity. Activity cannot take place unless there is somebody guiding it. If I see an effect, there has to be a cause.\n\nIf I see a wind moving, there is A cause somebody is in charge. Somebody making sure that in this condition only this thing can occur. So marutas were in charge of winds. And each type of wind has a different maruta. The Marichi is among the best because it is the in charge of the pleasant breeze which we can enjoy. We are afraid of tornado, we are afraid of hurricane.\n\nBut we are very happy when this pleasant breeze is flowing. Among all the Marutas, Nakshatranam, Ahamshashi, Nakshatrana, the asterisms or constellations among them all the arrangement of stars in the sky. In Nakshatra, the moon appears to be traveling through these star clusters. So when I see the night sky, the asterisms are dimly lit, but the moon is brightly lit. He seems like the king of all these asterisms, traveling through all these Nakshatras as if he were the king of all the Nakshatras.\n\nSo therefore he says, among the Nakshatras, I am Shashi. He say, consider me as the sun. Night time I see moon. He says, consider me as moon. If it is windy, consider that my Maruta are working. But when you feel at ease, most at comfort, I am Marichi.\n\nAnd among all the celestial beings, I am Vishnu. Without Vishnu, nothing can exist. So therefore, when you see anything, something which catches your imagination, something that can invoke these divine feelings in you, consider that my presence you are experiencing. The next verse says Vedanam Sama Vedo Asmi. Obviously, Arjuna was a product of a Vedic culture. We consider Vedas the basis of our culture.\n\nIf things cannot have a proof in Vedas, it is not true. Truth has to have basis in Vedas. And obviously we know there are four Vedas. Rug Veda, Sam Veda, Yajurveda and Tharva Veda. Sam Veda is most pleasant. Saam Veda is basically as we have heard all in poetry.\n\nRug Veda is in prose, Sama Veda in poetry. So listening to Sama Veda is most pleasant. Even today if you listen to our Panditji, he is Samavedi. When he chant, it really catches your attention. Chanting normally going on in temple, everybody is talking. You know, when he starts in a Sam Vedi chanting, everybody is quiet.\n\nSomething really unique, something which catches your attention, something which catches your mind is Sama Veda. Among all the Vedas, I am Sama Veda. Knowledge is in all Vedas. But something that can invoke the sense of divinity in your heart is when you have this beautiful Poetry sung in a proper raga. So if a Vedas discussion is going on and it is not interesting to me, Swamiji says it's like the Ghata Pata. You know, there's two pandits talking about this Vedic discussion.\n\nThey give examples: Ghata and Pata, Ghata and Pata. One who cannot get anything out of it says, \"All this is Garbhat\" — they are doing Garbhat. That's where the word Garbhat comes from. Because we cannot understand what they are talking about.\n\nSo it's Garbhat to us, even though they may be talking at the highest level. But even one who has no knowledge of Veda — if he listens to the Sama Veda, he will have that divinity experience in his heart. Bharu Bhagavan said, among Vedas, I am Sama Veda Devanam Asmi, Vasavah, Vasava Indra. Among the Devas, I am Indra.\n\nWe know Indra is the king of all the Devas. He is the mightiest, he is the wealthiest. He is the greatest kingdom Splendor. Deva Loka is supposed to be a place for enjoyment. Even the Devas have all these politics among themselves. Who is higher, who is lower.\n\nThey have as much jealousy as us. This is serial Kantosima. Indra's wife Paulami is the bad one and Santosima is the good one. One harasses people and one tries to save people. So among Devas, in other words, even if you reach to a level of goodness, your shortcomings will still be there. If I want to be happy and say, if I become a millionaire or a billionaire, I'll be happy.\n\nAll your shortcomings will be with you when you become billionaire. What is making me unhappy will make me unhappy. Then also just having wealth, just having accomplishment is not a remedy for any happiness or experiencing any divinity. But even when you consider that as the basis of divinity, I am among all Devasam Indra, most accomplished, the king of all. From a material wealth perspective, Indriyana Manasthyasmi. Even in the previous line, he also said among the Devasam Indra Deva means to Dev is to illuminate.\n\nThat which illuminates is the Deva.",
      "reflection": "Krishna begins His enumeration with a crucial clarification: \"Aham Atma Gudakesha sarva-bhutashaya-sthitah\" - \"I am the Self dwelling in the hearts of all beings.\" Before listing specific glories, He establishes the universal foundation: divinity is not only in the excellent but in all. He is the beginning, middle, and end of all beings - their source, sustenance, and dissolution. This prevents a common misunderstanding: that only special, excellent things are divine while ordinary things are not.\n\nThen come the celestial manifestations: among the Adityas (sun-deities), He is Vishnu the all-pervading; among luminaries, the radiant Sun; among the Maruts (wind-gods), He is Marichi the gentle breeze; among the Nakshatras (stars), He is the Moon. Notice the principle: in each category, Krishna identifies with what is most prominent, most beneficial, most capable of evoking awe. When you look up at the sun, you are seeing divine glory. When a pleasant breeze refreshes you, that is Marichi - divine comfort made tangible.\n\nToday, practice this cosmic vision. When you see sunlight streaming through a window, recognize it as Krishna's glory. When wind touches your face, feel the divine presence. The examples may seem archaic - we no longer worship the Adityas - but the principle is timeless. In whatever catches your attention and evokes wonder, the divine is more visibly present. What are the \"Suns\" and \"Moons\" in your life - those things that illuminate, that you cannot help but notice? Can you begin to see them as pointers to their source rather than ends in themselves?"

      "reflection": "These verses bring divine manifestations closer to human experience. Among the Vedas, Krishna is the Sama Veda - scripture set to music, the most beautiful and captivating. Among the senses, He is the Mind (Manas) - that which coordinates all perception. Among living beings, He is Consciousness (Chetana) itself. The principle is clear: whatever has the capacity to move the heart, to coordinate, to bring awareness - that is where the divine is most evident.\n\nThe mention of Sama Veda is particularly instructive. While all Vedas contain truth, Sama Veda captures attention through melody. Even those who cannot understand Sanskrit feel something when they hear Sama Vedic chanting - the divine speaks through beauty. Similarly, among priests Krishna is Brihaspati (the most eloquent), among generals He is Skanda (the most skilled), among waters He is the Ocean (the most vast). Excellence in any field - eloquence, strategy, expansiveness - these are divine signatures.\n\nToday, notice what captures your attention. When you hear music that moves you, recognize: this is Sama Veda, divine beauty speaking. When you witness someone coordinating complex activities skillfully, see Skanda - divine intelligence in action. When you encounter vastness - the ocean, the sky, a great idea - feel the presence of something beyond ordinary limits. Ask yourself: \"What has naturally captured my devotion, even before I called it spiritual? Can I now recognize that spontaneous attraction as the divine calling me home?\""

      "commentary": "We have been discussing Chapter 10, Vibhuti Yoga, Yoga of Divine Glories. Bhagavan, in the beginning of the chapter, made two basic points. First: all these divine qualities which you see in beings — such as Buddhi, Jnana, Asamoha, Samata, Ahimsa, Dana, Bhaya, Abhaya — all these qualities emanate from me. Because of my presence in them, they manifest these qualities. So whenever you see these qualities, know that I am present in that being. And then he said: Aham Sarvasya Prabhavah, Mattaha Sarva Pravartate.\n\nThere is nothing that is not based in me. I am the source of all things and beings, and everything proceeds from me. So Bhagawan has made it very clear that there is nothing which is devoid of him. But Arjuna obviously wanted examples in his world which he can relate to. So that's what he said: Keshu Keshu Bhaveshu Chintyo Asi Bhagavan Maya.\n\nIn what different forms that I see in this world can I worship as your presence? If I have to find examples of divinity which are worthy of worship, tell me — how do I find them, how do I recognize them, and how do I approach them? Therefore, Bhagavan said: when you see anything which is best among that category, consider that worthy of worshipping. Excellence is worthy of worshipping. Yogah Karmasu Kaushalam — proficiency is worshipable. Anything which is efficient and proficient.\n\nBhagawan said, consider that is my manifestation. It is worthy of worship. So therefore, Bhagavan has been giving various examples of best among those categories. And we have seen so far as Swamiji explains that Bhagawan started with Vedic examples based rooted in the culture of Vedic period. And then he has given some examples which are common between Vedic and Puranic period. And then he has been giving examples from Puranic period.\n\nIn other words, he's covering all that Arjuna has experienced, ancestral, past, folklore. And then Also the day to day world where I'm trying to find divinity. I try to find divinity in my great culture. Also try to find divinity in the folklore which I've heard from people. And I also try to find divinity in my world. Verses 27, 28, 29 continues in that tradition.\n\nWe are seeing more Puranic examples. Ucchaihshravasam Ashvanam Viddhi Mam Amritod Bhavam — among the horses, Ucchaihshravas, which came out of the endeavor of finding nectar. It is the story of churning the milky ocean to find the nectar of immortality. But byproducts of that effort we can call Riddhi and Siddhi. Swamiji explains here that this churning of the ocean is nothing but churning your own mind.\n\nOne side is bad and other side is good thoughts. Bad thoughts and good thoughts are churning your mind. What comes out of it are the byproducts I call Riddhi and Siddhi. When we try to achieve the final goal of liberation or immortality or ultimate happiness, whichever you want to call it, we are constantly churning our mind to find that ultimate happiness. In that process we achieve some accomplishments. Those are Siddhi and Riddhi.\n\nWe get these along our pursuit of happiness. We have not got the happiness yet, but we get some things which are byproducts of the pursuit. So me buying a BMW, or Albany and Maulik going to Hawaii — you people went to Hawaii and I bought a BMW X5 Hybrid over the weekend. So we covered two bases of my Vedantic journey. Now you have to go to Starbucks to complete the third leg of it. All that is in pursuit of happiness.\n\nThat's why I want to go to Hawaii. That's why I want to buy BMW. But that is not the end goal. Bhagavan says the end goal is to find the nectar. The nectar is endless happiness without any break in it. That is what we call immortality.\n\nThat is also what we call liberation. So this churning of the ocean — Viddhi Mam Amritod Bhavam. This flying horse came out of the pursuit of happiness as an excellent achievement from the pursuit of finding something else. They were not looking for a flying horse; they were looking for nectar. But what came out? A flying horse — the best among the horses.\n\nWe become excellent in our profession. But that actually was not the goal. I wanted to make more money. Then I became very proficient in my profession. We consider, unfortunately, that this is the goal. But that never was my real goal.\n\nMy goal was to be happy. But I sometimes become so enamored by my own achievement that I just stop right there, thinking \"I'm the best.\" So Bhagavan said, among horses, Uche Shravaha, the flying horse which came out of the journey of ocean, Airavatam, Gajendrana both came out of the same pursuit. The white elephant with many tusks came out. Airavat and Cheshrava, the flying horse came. They both came in same pursuit of finding nectar.\n\nThe airavat was given to Indra, but horse was given to Daitya. But both came out as excellent examples of something you can accomplish by your pursuit of finding nectar. Bliss Naranamcha, Naradhipah among men. I am the king among man. When somebody becomes as powerful as one can be, he is called king. Airavat is an example among elephants, Uchesa among horses.\n\nSo in all living beings you find example of excellence. In our culture the king is considered divine representation. Not only in our culture, but all Western cultures also King was considered divine. He is the one who is supporting the whole kingdom by his own action. Therefore he is considered divine. Anything that is excellent among man, among animals, among beings of any kind considered to be my manifestation is worthy of worshipping.\n\nBecause the original question was Keshu, Keshu, Chabhesu. So Bhagavan is giving him various examples. Ayudhanam Aham Vajraha. Not only beings but things. Among the weapons and Vajra. Vajra was conceived by Indra as the weapon which can kill the demon Vritrasur.\n\nHe was the snake in a human form. The snake is generally considered poisonous. So something which is poisonous and in stopping my progress bad thoughts in my mind. So Vhtrasu is my negative tendencies. And to kill that I need a weapon which is powerful and effective. So here Indra to kill Vritrasur wanted Vajra, the ultimate weapon to kill this demon who was stopping the course of rivers.\n\nSo he was someone who was stopping the progress. So Vritrasur could only be killed by something which is very pious and self-sacrificing. So Indra found that Dadhichi is the right candidate. He had all the positive qualities, selfless in his endeavors. And when Dadhichi was approached, he agreed to give up his body. His bones were then used to make this Vajra.\n\nThe meaning of this metaphor is if you have to kill the negative tendencies of your mind, you have to sacrifice. Selfless sacrifice is the only sure weapon to kill the negativity in your mind. Of all the weapons to kill your negativity Bhagwan said, I am Vajra Denunam Asmi Kamaduk among cows. The milch cow was also described in chapter three in verse 10 where Bhagavan said Sahayagna prajasrustva Purvacha Prajapati Anena Prasi vistadvam ishacha asthu isht Kama dhak. In the beginning Prajapati said, I have created Praja in the same time Yajna. This Yajna will be your Kamadhenu.\n\nThis Yajna will be your cow which fulfills all your desires. So the Kamadenu is something which has the capacity to fulfill all your desires. According to the Puranas, Vasishtha had this Kamadhenu. This cow could give whatever you desire, like a genie in an Arabic tale. Whatever you desire, the genie can present.\n\nBhagavan said Kamadhenu is your cooperative endeavor — your Yajna spirit. When you work together, when you combine the resources of your community, of your family, of your country, then you can get whatever you want. In our culture, the cow is sacred because the cow supports life. In olden days, the cow provided everything. Cow provided milk for sustaining bodies.\n\nCow also provided bullocks to till the land. Cow also provided cow dung as a source of fuel. That cow dung was also used as building material to plaster the floors. The cow has the ultimate giving capacity — it can sustain life. And therefore the cow is considered sacred. But among all cows Bhagavan said, I am Kama Dhuk.\n\nI am Kama Dhenu which has capacity to fulfill all desires. And as Bhagawan said in chapter three, Kama Dhenu is your Yajna spirit. When you work selflessly and work together, you can fulfill all your desires. Prajanascha Asmi Kandarpah — among the progenitors, I am that instinct to create progeny. This instinct, Bhagavan said, is divine.\n\nNormally any sexual instinct we consider it to be negative, not good. Our culture clearly says that's divine. Anything which is natural has to be divine. So this instinct to further your progeny is a divine instinct. Attraction for the opposite sex is put in beings by Bhagavan for a reason and therefore it is divine. Swamiji used to say that if you don't get attracted by opposite sex, go and see a doctor.\n\nThere's something wrong with you. That is something natural and divine. It is how you use it, how you Manage it makes it either divine or devilish. Kandarpah is that innate attraction for the opposite sex in you. I am that. Sarpanam Asmi Vasukihi.\n\nWe have discussed two types of snakes: Sarpa and Naga. Sarpa is the unhooded snake. The hooded snake is Naga. Snakes like pythons and other garden snakes. And they are not many times poisonous. Python can kill you, but it's not poisonous.\n\nThere's a Naga Panchami day at least in Surat where I grew up. All these guys will bring cobra in in their little basket. And my mother will offer milk and give some donation. Naga cobra is poisonous. But Bhagavan said even that poisonous instinct in beings is also divine. Because there is no other source for this poisonous instinct than God alone.\n\nEverything in this world, even though it seems negative from our perspective, when you change the perspective it becomes natural and necessary. I very recently read an article, I think in the New York Times, saying forest fires are necessary for the survival of the forest. Now that was a complete revelation to me. Because every time I see forest fire in California on the TV I say why can't they do something?\n\nCan they not figure out how to stop this thing? Or what is the purpose of this? And it really opened my eyes. That article said without forest fire, forest cannot survive because the undergrowth will be so dense the trees won't survive. The forest fires clean up the forest every year now, obviously out of control. Anything creates disasters.\n\nAnd most of the forest fires are man made or man created. They are not naturally created. So anything which I see negative may have been over manipulated by someone. But the actual phenomenon, whether it seems negative or positive from my perspective, is natural and divine. So therefore Bhagawan says Sarpanam Asmi Vasukihi. Among serpents, I am Vasuki. Vasuki is the smallest snake on Shiva's finger.\n\nVasuki was also used as the rope in churning the ocean. And Vasuki selflessly volunteered to become that rope for churning the ocean. Among snakes, Vasuki is the one who gives his services selflessly for the common good. Anantascha Asmi Naganam — and among Nagas, I am Ananta. Ananta means endless. Another name is Ananta Shesha Naga.\n\nWe have seen Vishnu lying on the Shesha Naga in slumber, Lakshmi Ji massaging his feet, a lotus coming out of his navel, and Brahma Ji sitting on it. So this thousand-hooded snake is nothing but my mind — a thousand different desires in a thousand different directions. With that capacity when it is associated with Tamas and Rajas, it has creative urge.",
      "reflection": "These verses introduce the sacred syllable OM and silent prayer (Japa) as divine manifestations. Among words, Krishna is \"Ekam Aksharam\" - the one imperishable syllable, OM. Among offerings, He is Japa-yajna - the sacrifice of repetition, the silent turning of the mind toward the divine. Among immovable things, He is the Himalayas - stable, majestic, pointing upward. Each pointer reveals something about recognizing the divine: the simplest sound, the quietest practice, the most enduring presence.\n\nThe examples also include the Ashvattha (sacred fig tree) whose roots grow downward and branches upward - a symbol of the world rooted in the divine; Narada among divine seers - the eternal wanderer spreading divine names; Chitraratha among Gandharvas - celestial musicians; Kapila among Siddhas - the philosopher who founded Sankhya. Excellence takes many forms: wisdom, devotion, artistry, philosophical depth. In whatever domain someone achieves mastery, there the divine presence shines more brightly.\n\nToday, practice the simplest of these manifestations: OM and Japa. Take a few moments to chant OM - not as technique but as recognition that this primordial sound contains all sounds. Or practice silent repetition of a divine name, noticing how Japa naturally calms and focuses the mind. When you see mountains or large trees, let them remind you of stability and aspiration. Ask yourself: \"What is my 'Himalaya' - the stable, immovable foundation in my life? What is my 'Japa' - the quiet, persistent practice that keeps turning my mind toward truth?\""

      "commentary": "We have been discussing Chapter 10, Vibhuti Yoga, Yoga of Divine Glories. Bhagavan, in the beginning of the chapter, made two basic points. First: all these divine qualities which you see in beings — such as Buddhi, Jnana, Asamoha, Samata, Ahimsa, Dana, Bhaya, Abhaya — all these qualities emanate from me. Because of my presence in them, they manifest these qualities. So whenever you see these qualities, know that I am present in that being. And then he said: Aham Sarvasya Prabhavah, Mattaha Sarva Pravartate.\n\nThere is nothing that is not based in me. I am the source of all things and beings, and everything proceeds from me. So Bhagawan has made it very clear that there is nothing which is devoid of him. But Arjuna obviously wanted examples in his world which he can relate to. So that's what he said: Keshu Keshu Bhaveshu Chintyo Asi Bhagavan Maya.\n\nIn what different forms that I see in this world can I worship as your presence? If I have to find examples of divinity which are worthy of worship, tell me — how do I find them, how do I recognize them, and how do I approach them? Therefore, Bhagavan said: when you see anything which is best among that category, consider that worthy of worshipping. Excellence is worthy of worshipping. Yogah Karmasu Kaushalam — proficiency is worshipable. Anything which is efficient and proficient.\n\nBhagawan said, consider that is my manifestation. It is worthy of worship. So therefore, Bhagavan has been giving various examples of best among those categories. And we have seen so far as Swamiji explains that Bhagawan started with Vedic examples based rooted in the culture of Vedic period. And then he has given some examples which are common between Vedic and Puranic period. And then he has been giving examples from Puranic period.\n\nIn other words, he's covering all that Arjuna has experienced, ancestral, past, folklore. And then Also the day to day world where I'm trying to find divinity. I try to find divinity in my great culture. Also try to find divinity in the folklore which I've heard from people. And I also try to find divinity in my world. Verses 27, 28, 29 continues in that tradition.\n\nWe are seeing more Puranic examples. Ucchaihshravasam Ashvanam Viddhi Mam Amritod Bhavam — among the horses, Ucchaihshravas, which came out of the endeavor of finding nectar. It is the story of churning the milky ocean to find the nectar of immortality. But byproducts of that effort we can call Riddhi and Siddhi. Swamiji explains here that this churning of the ocean is nothing but churning your own mind.\n\nOne side is bad and other side is good thoughts. Bad thoughts and good thoughts are churning your mind. What comes out of it are the byproducts I call Riddhi and Siddhi. When we try to achieve the final goal of liberation or immortality or ultimate happiness, whichever you want to call it, we are constantly churning our mind to find that ultimate happiness. In that process we achieve some accomplishments. Those are Siddhi and Riddhi.\n\nWe get these along our pursuit of happiness. We have not got the happiness yet, but we get some things which are byproducts of the pursuit.

Now you have to go to Starbucks to complete the third leg of it. All that is in pursuit of happiness.\n\nThat's why I want to go to Hawaii. That's why I want to buy BMW. But that is not the end goal. Bhagavan says the end goal is to find the nectar. The nectar is endless happiness without any break in it. That is what we call immortality.\n\nThat is also what we call liberation. So this churning of the ocean — Viddhi Mam Amritod Bhavam. This flying horse came out of the pursuit of happiness as an excellent achievement from the pursuit of finding something else. They were not looking for a flying horse; they were looking for nectar. But what came out? A flying horse — the best among the horses.\n\nWe become excellent in our profession. That actually was the goal. I want to make more money. Then I became very proficient in my profession. We consider unfortunately that is the goal. That never was my goal.\n\nMy goal was to be happy. But I sometimes become so Enamored by my own achievement that I just stop right there, that I'm the best. So Bhagavan said, among horses, Uche Shravaha, the flying horse which came out of the journey of ocean, Airavatam, Gajendrana both came out of the same pursuit. The white elephant with many tusks came out. Airavat and Cheshrava, the flying horse came.

When somebody becomes as powerful as one can be, he is called king. Airavat is an example among elephants, Uchesa among horses.\n\nSo in all living beings you find example of excellence. In our culture the king is considered divine representation. Not only in our culture, but all Western cultures also King was considered divine. He is the one who is supporting the whole kingdom by his own action. Therefore he is considered divine. Anything that is excellent among man, among animals, among beings of any kind considered to be my manifestation is worthy of worshipping.\n\nBecause the original question was Keshu, Keshu, Chabhesu. So Bhagavan is giving him various examples. Ayudhanam Aham Vajraha. Not only beings but things. Among the weapons and Vajra. Vajra was conceived by Indra as the weapon which can kill the demon Vritrasur.\n\nHe was the snake in a human form. The snake is generally considered poisonous.

So Vritrasur can be only be killed by something which is very pious and self sacrificing. So Indra found the Dhiji is the right candidate. He has all the positive qualities selfless in his endeavors. And when the Dichi approached, he agreed to give up his body. And then his bones were used to make this Vajra.\n\nThe meaning of this metaphor is if you have to kill the negative tendencies of your mind, you have to sacrifice. Selfless sacrifice is the only sure weapon to kill the negativity in your mind. Of all the weapons to kill your negativity Bhagwan said, I am Vajra Denunam Asmi Kamaduk among cows. The milch cow was also described in chapter three in verse 10 where Bhagavan said Sahayagna prajasrustva Purvacha Prajapati Anena Prasi vistadvam ishacha asthu isht Kama dhak. In the beginning Prajapati said, I have created Praja in the same time Yajna. This Yajna will be your Kamadhenu.\n\nThis Yajna will be your cow which fulfills all your desires. So the Kamadenu is something which has capacity to fulfill all your desires. And as for Purana, Vasisthta had this Kamadhina. Vasistha had this cow. This cow which can give whatever you desire like a genie in other Arabic tale. Whatever you desire, genie can present.\n\nBhagavan said, kamadhanu is your cooperative endeavors Yajna spirit. When you work together, when you combine your resources of your community, of your family, of your country then you can get whatever you want. Dhienuna masmikamadu. In our culture cow is sacred because cow supports life. In olden days cow provided everything. Cow provided milk for sustaining bodies.\n\nCow also provided bullocks to till the land. Cow also provided cow dung for source of fuel. That cow dung was also his building material to plaster the floors. The cow has ultimate giving capacity that it can sustain life. And and therefore cow is considered sacred. But among all cows Bhagavan said, I am Kama Dhuk.\n\nI am Kama Dhenu which has capacity to fulfill all desires. And as Bhagawana said in chapter three, Kama Denu is your Yajna spirit. When you work selflessly and work together you can fulfill all your desires. Prajanastya Asmi Kandarpah among the progenitor. I am that instinct to create progeny. This instinct, Bhagavan said, is divine.\n\nNormally any sexual instinct we consider it to be negative, not good. Our culture clearly says that's divine. Anything which is natural has to be divine. So this instinct to further your progeny is a divine instinct. Attraction for the opposite sex is put in beings by Bhagavan for a reason and therefore it is divine. Swamiji used to say that if you don't get attracted by opposite sex, go and see a doctor.\n\nThere's something wrong with you. That is something natural and divine. It is how you use it, how you Manage it makes it either divine or devilish. Prajanas chasmi Kandarpaha. Kandarpah is that innate attraction for the opposite sex in you. I am that Sarpanam Asmi Vasukihi.\n\nWe have discussed two types of snakes, Sarpa and naga. Sarpa is the unhooded snake. Hooded snake is Naga. Snakes like pythons and other garden snakes. And they are not many times poisonous. Python can kill you, but it's not poisonous.\n\nThere's a Naga Panchami day at least in Surat where I grew up. All these guys will bring cobra in in their little basket. And my mother will offer milk and give some donation. Naga cobra is poisonous.

And Vasuki also selflessly volunteered to become that rope which are on the ocean among snakes. And Vasuki who gives his services selflessly for the common good. Anantahacha Asminagana. And among Nagam Ananta Ananta endless. Another name of Ananta Nageshanahaya.\n\nWe have seen Vishnu lying on the sheshanag in a slumber. Lakshmi Ji massaging his feet and Lotus coming out of his navel and Brahmaji sitting on it. So this thousand hooded snake is nothing but my mind. It is thousand different desires in thousand different directions. With that capacity when it is associated with Tamas and Rajas, it has creative urge.",
      "reflection": "These verses present perhaps the most challenging of Krishna's identifications: \"Prajanah cha asmi Kandarpah\" - I am the creative desire in beings (Kandarpa/Kama). The procreative instinct, often seen as unspiritual or base, is here declared divine. Anything natural, placed in beings for a purpose, partakes of divinity. The issue is never the instinct itself but how it is expressed - controlled or compulsive, sacred or profane. Similarly, Krishna is Vajra among weapons - the thunderbolt that destroys negativity - and Kamadhenu among cows - the wish-fulfilling power of cooperative endeavor (Yajna).\n\nEven more striking: \"Sarpanam asmi Vasuki\" - among serpents, I am Vasuki, who selflessly served as the churning rope when gods and demons sought nectar. And among the hooded serpents (Nagas), I am Ananta (the endless one) upon whom Vishnu rests. The serpent represents the mind with its thousand desires moving in every direction; when this same energy supports the divine (as Ananta supports Vishnu), it becomes sacred. What seems dangerous becomes the very vehicle of the divine.\n\nToday, contemplate the divinization of natural instincts. That drive you feel - for creation, for union, for achievement - is not inherently unspiritual. The question is: does it serve the whole or only the ego? Vasuki volunteered for service and was honored; Ananta supports the divine in rest. Can your desires become like Vasuki - offered in service? Like Ananta - supporting divine presence rather than chasing endless wants? Ask: \"What instincts do I judge as 'unspiritual'? Can I see them instead as divine energy awaiting proper direction?\""

      "commentary": "We have been discussing Chapter 10, Vibhuti Yoga, Yoga of Divine Glories. As we have seen, Arjuna, after listening to the whole discourse from Bhagavan on the nature of the Supreme Self, said, \"But I need to know more.\" So in verse 18 he says: Vistarena Atmano Yogam Vibhutim cha Janardana, Bhuyah Kathaya Triptir hi Shrinvato Nasti Me Amritam. \"Tell me again in detail, O Janardana, your Yoga power and your immanent glory, because I do not feel satisfied hearing your life-giving, nectar-like speech.\" In other words, he said, give me some examples. So Bhagavan said: Divya hi Atma Vibhutayah — my glories are divine.\n\nPradhanyataha Kuru Shreshtha Na Astyantah Vistarasya Me. There is no end to this glory, but I can give you some prominent examples. So Bhagavan clearly clarified to Arjuna: I'm going to give you some prominent examples. They do not constitute my entire glory, but they will give you some idea of where to see my presence. So we have been seeing many examples, right from the Vedic period to the Puranic period. And Bhagavan is now even coming down to our day-to-day experiences.\n\nPavanaha Pavatamasmi — something which we experience in phenomenal nature. Everything and every being is nothing but my own self, because he said everything proceeds from me and I am the source of all things and beings. There is no other thing which has created this universe. When we see an effect, there have to be two causes.\n\nOne is the efficient cause — somebody who knows how to make that thing come into existence. And one is the material to create that thing. Take pizza: we need a pizza maker and pizza ingredients. So if you see pizza here, you can't simply say, \"Well, the pizza just appeared here. We are Chinmaya Mission, we are divine people. We don't need to order pizza.\"\n\nPizza just appears here. We know that an intelligent person will not believe that. He knows that if there is pizza there, there is a pizza maker and he had the ingredients for the pizza. So the same way, if this world exists, there is the material cause and efficient cause. Material cause is something which we have difficulty understanding. We think if Bhagavan knows everything, obviously he knows how to create this world.\n\nThe problem is where did he find the material? How do we create something? I'm an architect, so I can create buildings. Because I know how to design building. Just knowing how to create building doesn't create building. I need to have materials.\n\nGo to Home Depot or Lowe's to buy that material. Ask Home Depot, \"Where do you get materials?\" \"We get them from our suppliers.\" So you can go up to the source of the material, where it came from. In this case, if we find the source of the material which Bhagavan used to create this Jagat, you can always say that Bhagavan found the material from X. Then X becomes greater than the Bhagawan who created it.\n\nGo to X and say, \"Where did you get the material?\" \"From Y.\" Then Y becomes greater than X because he had the original material. Ask Y, \"Where did you get the material?\" \"Z had the material,\" and then Z becomes greater than Y. So this exercise is futile because we cannot get to the ultimate source of the material. You have to come to the conclusion that Bhagavan himself was the source of the material.\n\nIn Bhagawan, there's only one thing which he did not have to buy, borrow, or steal — that is his own self. Everything we acquire in this world, we bought from somebody, borrowed from somebody, or took from somebody. But one thing I never had to acquire is my own self.\n\nThat which I call \"I.\" I did not acquire it from anywhere. I didn't buy from anywhere. So that's the only material available to Bhagavan. So he created this Jagat using his knowledge of creating this universe as an efficient cause. And he also used the material available to him with his own self. So he became the material cause and the efficient cause for this universe.\n\nTherefore he said, everything proceeds from me and I am the source of all things. However, that is not something for us to easily understand. So give me some examples of glories. It may be difficult to find glory in something which is average. But we can find it in something which is really excellent. If you have a water jug and you put just a little salt in it, and you taste it, you won't know that there is salt in it.\n\nBut if there's a lot of salt in it and you taste it, you know there's salt in it. The Bhagawan has been giving several prominent examples. Sarjanam, Adihicha, Antacha, Madhyamcha Evam, Aham, Arjunah. In the creation for anything which is created and the beginning, the middle and the end, there is no other material to create anything, to sustain anything or destroy anything. The same material which was used to create this Jagat, everything in Jagat in this universe is also created by the same original material.\n\nSo Bhagawan said, any creation you see in this world, I am the beginning, the middle and the end. In verse 33 he says, Aksaranam Akaro Asmi. In the previous verse he said, among all the sounds, I am the one syllable, Om. Because Om is the primordial sound. That is the sound which is the most basic sound out of which all the other variation of sounds come into existence. As I said, it's like three color printing.\n\nThere are only three cartridges in your printer. But when you print a picture, permutation combination of those three colors created this wonderful picture which is a variety of colors. So A-U-M is like the source of all the sounds. Om is the sum total of all the sounds that we hear in this world. Out of Om, the first sound is A. A signifies creation, U signifies sustenance, and M signifies dissolution. So when you close your mouth, it's Ma. I heard Anup Jilotra telling a joke.\n\nHe was teaching a female student. He said she would do Sa-Re-Ga-Ma, but when it comes to Ma, she would skip it. He said, \"Why are you skipping Ma?\" She said, \"Ma, I have to close my mouth so my lipstick gets spoiled.\" So Ma — you are closing your lips, signifying the dissolution. A comes from your belly, signifying creation. Aksaranam Akaro Asmi. Among the letters, I am A. Swamiji also explains that in every language, the alphabet starts with A, and without a vowel you cannot make any word. And Swamiji explains that in Sanskrit there is a preponderance of the A sound. Therefore it is such a sweet-sounding language. Among the compound words in Sanskrit, I am Dvandva.\n\nThose of us who have learned a little bit of Sanskrit know there are several types of compound words. I know only one very well: Bahuvrihi Samasa. Yasya Kantah Nilah — whose neck is blue? Neela Kantha. That's a Bahuvrihi Samasa. So two words, Neela and Kantha, when you combine them become Neelakantha. That's what I remember from my 8th standard Sanskrit. In this, Neela is actually almost like an adjective.\n\nIt does not have the same value as Kantha. Neela is just the attribute of that Kantha. But in Dvandva Samasa, when two words are used, they both retain their own identity. Sita-Ram — Sita and Ram both maintain their own identity, their own importance. Therefore Dvandva is considered the most prominent Samasa. Bhagavan says among the compound words, I am Dvandva — that which retains the value of both.\n\nSwamiji explains here that some commentators have commented that it also may be indicating the Self and non-Self. So this entire world of ours is made up of something which we call the Self — that is me — and something which is not me, which is the non-Self. In Vedanta, this body, mind, and intellect are non-Self. They are not really permanent. \"I\" am permanent — the \"I\" feeling is permanent. This beautiful combination of Self and non-Self which we see in our Jagat — the Self remains the Self, and still the non-Self retains its own identity as a plurality in this world.\n\nSo therefore Bhagawan says: among compound words, I am Dvandva. Aham Eva Akshayaha Kalaha. I am that ever-existing time. He said among the reckoners, among the measures, I am time. Everything we know is defined in space and time. Indian philosophers have given more importance to time.\n\nThey say time is fundamental, and space is an emergent quality of time. So Bhagawan said, I am time. Among all the ways we measure things, I am time. In all measurement, time is the most important one. He said I am that infinite time.\n\nIt seems like to us that it is flowing and going. But time remains constant. It's our experiences that change. Our experience of time starts with one event followed by a second event. If there's only one event, there is no time. When only the first event occurs, there is no time.\n\nWe measure time between two events. Therefore, Swamiji says the measure of time in English is called \"second,\" not \"first.\" There is no \"first\" in time — only seconds. So here he says I am that infinite time, not the finite time perceived through your senses. Dhata Aham Vishwato Mukaha — and I am also the Karma Phaladata. I am also the supporter, the dispenser of all your experiences.\n\nI experience as long as I'm alive, as long as I'm conscious. So my consciousness is the dispenser of all my thoughts and experiences. Dhata Vishwato Mukaha — facing everywhere, that Self which is in me. Facing everywhere and getting experience of everything is the same self in you. That Self is facing everywhere, gaining all the experience outside. So when you put it together, Bhagavan is everywhere.\n\nNo matter where you see, he is there. The next verse says Mrityuh Sarva Harascha — I am death among all that takes things away from you. You can lose things in an accident. You can lose things in various ways in life.\n\nWe lose money in the stock market. But you see, you're still left with something. I may lose money, but I'll have my health. I may be out of health, but I'm still alive. So there's something left. I lost something, but when I die, I lose everything.\n\nThere's nothing left for me. Therefore, I am death — it takes away everything from you. You cannot take anything with you. Therefore it's Mrityu Sarva Haraschaham — the greatest taker, who takes everything that you think is yours. Udbhavascha Bhavisyatam. The translation in the book is slightly confusing. It says, \"I am the prosperity of those who are to be prosperous.\"\n\nSwamiji clarifies that's not really the appropriate interpretation of Udbhava. Udbhava means to come into existence. \"I am the source of all that is coming to be in the future.\" Not only am I the source of all things and beings in the present that you see, but I am also the source of everything that will come into existence in the future. In other words, past, present, and future are just concepts of my mind. There is only one existence, and it exists all the time.\n\nAnd therefore anything which is created in that existence is nothing but the expression of the same supreme reality which is all-pervading, everlasting, omnipresent, omniscient. Kirtihi Shri Vakcha Narinam Smriti Medha Dhriti Kshamah. All women can take some pride here. All the good qualities listed are feminine. Bhagawan says I am these feminine qualities. Fame, prosperity, speech, memory, intelligence, firmness and forgiveness. All these qualities are manifest in people because of my presence.",
      "reflection": "These verses reveal the divine in language, knowledge, and time itself. Among letters, Krishna is \"A\" (Akara) - the first sound, present in every vowel, essential for all speech. Among compound words, He is Dvandva - the type that preserves the equal identity of both components (like \"Sita-Ram\" where neither subsumes the other). This points to the coexistence of Self and non-self, spirit and matter, maintaining their distinct identities while unified. Among sciences, He is Adhyatma-vidya - the science of the Self, supreme among all knowledge because it reveals the knower behind all knowing.\n\nMost profound is \"Aham eva akshayah kalah\" - \"I am inexhaustible Time.\" Time seems to devour everything, yet Krishna identifies with that which makes all experience possible. Without time, there is no before and after, no change, no experience. The measure of time in English is \"second\" (not \"first\") because time only appears when there is a second event to mark against the first. This infinite, unchanging Time is not what we measure with clocks but the eternal present in which all moments arise.\n\nToday, practice awareness of these subtle divine presences. When you speak or write, recognize that the vowel \"A\" underlies your words - language itself carries divine essence. When you learn anything, ask: does this knowledge reveal or obscure the knower? The science of Self (Adhyatma-vidya) is supreme because all other knowledge is useless if we do not know who is knowing. Most importantly, notice Time - not as minutes passing but as the unchanging awareness in which all events occur. Can you touch that \"inexhaustible Time\" behind your moment-to-moment experience?"

      "commentary": "We have been discussing Chapter 10, Vibhuti Yoga, Yoga of Divine Glories. As we have seen, Arjuna, after listening to the whole discourse from Bhagavan on the nature of the Supreme Self, said, \"But I need to know more.\" So in verse 18 he says: Vistarena Atmano Yogam Vibhutim cha Janardana, Bhuyah Kathaya Triptir hi Shrinvato Nasti Me Amritam. \"Tell me again in detail, O Janardana, your Yoga power and your immanent glory, because I do not feel satisfied hearing your life-giving, nectar-like speech.\" In other words, he said, give me some examples. So Bhagavan said: Divya hi Atma Vibhutayah — my glories are divine.\n\nPradhanyataha Kuru Shreshtha Na Astyantah Vistarasya Me. There is no end to this glory, but I can give you some prominent examples. So Bhagavan clearly clarified to Arjuna: I'm going to give you some prominent examples. They do not constitute my entire glory, but they will give you some idea of where to see my presence. So we have been seeing many examples, right from the Vedic period to the Puranic period. And Bhagavan is now even coming down to our day-to-day experiences.\n\nPavanaha Pavatamasmi — something which we experience in phenomenal nature. Everything and every being is nothing but my own self, because he said everything proceeds from me and I am the source of all things and beings. There is no other thing which has created this universe. When we see an effect, there have to be two causes.\n\nOne is the efficient cause — somebody who knows how to make that thing come into existence. And one is the material to create that thing. Take pizza: we need a pizza maker and pizza ingredients. So if you see pizza here, you can't simply say, \"Well, the pizza just appeared here. We are Chinmaya Mission, we are divine people. We don't need to order pizza.\"\n\nPizza just appears here. We know that an intelligent person will not believe that. He knows that if there is pizza there, there is a pizza maker and he had the ingredients for the pizza. So the same way, if this world exists, there is the material cause and efficient cause. Material cause is something which we have difficulty understanding. We think if Bhagavan knows everything, obviously he knows how to create this world.\n\nThe problem is where did he find the material? How do we create something? I'm an architect, so I can create buildings. Because I know how to design building. Just knowing how to create building doesn't create building. I need to have materials.\n\nGo to Home Depot or Lowe's to buy that material. Ask Home Depot, \"Where do you get materials?\" \"We get them from our suppliers.\" So you can go up to the source of the material, where it came from. In this case, if we find the source of the material which Bhagavan used to create this Jagat, you can always say that Bhagavan found the material from X. Then X becomes greater than the Bhagawan who created it.\n\nGo to X and say, \"Where did you get the material?\" \"From Y.\" Then Y becomes greater than X because he had the original material. Ask Y, \"Where did you get the material?\" \"Z had the material,\" and then Z becomes greater than Y. So this exercise is futile because we cannot get to the ultimate source of the material. You have to come to the conclusion that Bhagavan himself was the source of the material.\n\nIn Bhagawan, there's only one thing which he did not have to buy, borrow, or steal — that is his own self. Everything we acquire in this world, we bought from somebody, borrowed from somebody, or took from somebody. But one thing I never had to acquire: that is my own self.\n\nThat which I call I. I did not acquire it from anywhere. I didn't buy from anywhere. So that's the only material available to Bhagavan. So he created this Jagat using his knowledge of creating this universe as an efficient cause. And he also used the material available to him with his own self. So he became the material cause and the efficient cause for this universe.\n\nTherefore he said, everything proceeds from me and I am the source of all things. However, that is not something for us to easily understand. So give me some examples of glories. It may be difficult to find glory in something which is average. But we can find in something which is really excellent. If you have a water jug and if you just a little salt in it and you taste it you won't know that there is salt in it.\n\nBut there's a lot of salt in it. And you taste it, you know there's salt in it. The Bhagawan has been giving several prominent examples. Sarjanam, Adihicha, Antacha, Madhyamcha Evam, Aham, Arjunah. In the creation for anything which is created and the beginning, the middle and the end, there is no other material to create anything, to sustain anything or destroy anything. The same material which was used to create this Jagat, everything in Jagat in this universe is also created by the same original material.\n\nSo Bhagawan said, any creation you see in this world, I am the beginning, the middle and the end. In verse 33 he says, Aksaranam Akaro Asmi. In previous verse he said, in all the sounds and then one syllable, Om. Because Om is the primordial sound. That is the sound which is the most basic sound out of which all the other variation of sounds come into existence. As I said, it's like three color printing.\n\nThere are only three cartridges in your printer. But when you print a picture, permutation combination of those three colors created this wonderful picture which is a variety of colors. So this aa and M is like the source of all the sounds that we hear in this world is the sum total of all the sounds. The Om out of which the first sound is a. U in Ma signifies creation, O signifies such stance and Ma signifies. So when you close your mouth, it's a ma. I heard Anup Jilotra telling a joke.\n\nHe was teaching a female student. He said, she will do saregami when it comes to maa, she will skip this ma. He said, why are you skipping Ma? He said, ma, I have to close my mouth so my lipstick gets spoiled. So Ma, you are closing your lips signifying the destruction. Aa comes from your belly.\n\nSo that's a creation. Aksaranam akaru asmi. Among the letters I am a. Swamiji also explains that every language, the Alphabet starts with A and without a vowel you cannot make any word. And Swamiji explains that in Sanskrit there is a preponderance of a sound. Therefore it is so sweet sounding language. Among the compound words in Sanskrit, I'm Dwandva.\n\nThose of us who have learned a little bit of Sanskrit, there are several compounding words. I know only one very well. Bahubri samas, yasyakantaha nilaha, Sahneela Kantaha whose neck is blue and Neela kanta, that's a Bahuri samas. So two words, Neela and Kanta, when you combine it With Neel Kant. That's why I remember from my 8th standard Sanskrit that is called Bahu Brahi Samas. Neela is actually almost like an adjective.\n\nIt does not have same value as Kantha. Nila is just the attributes of that Kanta. But as Dvanga samas used two words, they both retain their own identity. Dita, Ram, Sita and Ram both maintain their own identity, their own importance. Therefore Dhvandva is considered the most prominent samas. Bhagavan says among the compound words I am Dhvandva that which retains the value of both.\n\nSwamiji explains here that some commentators have commented that it also may be indicating the self and non self. So this entire world of ours is made up of something which we call it self that is me and something which is not me, which is non self. In Vedanta, this body, mind, intellect are non self. They are not really permanent. I am permanent, I feeling is permanent. This beautiful combination of self and non self which we see in our Jagat where self remains the self and still non self retains its own identity as a plurality in this world.\n\nSo therefore it says Dwandva amongst compound words. I'm Dwandva Aham Eva Akshayaha Kalaha. I am that ever existing time. For he said among the reckoners, Kalaitam kalaham among the measures, I am time. Everything we know is defined in space and time. Indian philosophers have given more importance to time.\n\nThey say time is fundamental. Space is an emergent quality of time. So in that he said, I am the time. Among all the reckon how we measure things, I am time. In all the measurement, time is the most important one. He said I am that infinite time.\n\nIt seems like to us it is flowing and going. But time remains constant. It's our experiences change. Our time starts with the experience of any event followed by the second event. If there's only one event, there is no time. The first event occurs, there is no time.\n\nWe measure time between the two events. Therefore, Swamiji says the measure of time in English is second, not first. There is no time second. So here he says I am that infinite time, not that perceived through your senses as finite time. Dhata aham Vishwato Mukaha and I am also the Karma Falada. I am also the supporter, the dispenser of all your experiences.\n\nI experience as long as I'M alive as long as I'm conscious. So my consciousness is the dispenser of all my thoughts and experiences. Daata Viswato Mukaha Facing everywhere that self which in me. Facing everywhere and getting experience of everything is the same self in you. Facing everywhere, gaining all the experience outside. So when you put it together, Bhagavan is everywhere.\n\nNo matter where you see, he is there. Next verse says mrtyuhu Sarva harascha. I am death among all that takes things away from you. You can lose things in some accident. You can lose things by losing something. Various ways we lose things in life.\n\nWe lose money in stock market. But you see that still you will be left with something. I may lose money, but I'll have my health. I'm out of health, but I'm still alive. So there's something left. You know, I lost something, but when I die, I lost everything.\n\nThere's nothing left for me. Therefore, once I am the death, it takes away everything from you. You cannot take anything with you. Therefore it's a Mrityo Sarva Haraschaham, the greatest taker to take everything that you think is yours. Udbhavastcha Bhavish. The translation in the book is slightly confusing which says, I am the prosperity of those who are to be prosperous.\n\nSwamiji clarifies that's not the really appropriate interpretation of Udbhava. Udbhava means to come into existence. I am the source of all that is coming to be in existence in future. Not only I am the source of all things and beings in present that you see, but I am also the source of everything that will come in existence in future. In other words, past, present and future are just concepts of my mind. There is only one existence and it exists all the time.\n\nAnd therefore anything which is created in that existence is nothing but the expression of the same supreme reality which is all pervading, everlasting, omnipresent, omniscient, Kirtihi Sri wakcha, NRI nam smruti medha, dhrutikshamah. All women can take some pride here. All the good qualities are feminine. It says that I am the feminine qualities. Fame, prosperity, speech, memory, intelligence, firmness and forgiveness. All these qualities are manifest in people because of my presence.",
      "reflection": "Here Krishna makes His most challenging identification: \"Mrityuh sarva-harash cha aham\" - \"I am death, the all-devouring.\" Death takes everything we think is ours; nothing survives its grasp. Yet even this ultimate loss is divine manifestation. Why? Because death reveals what is truly ours (consciousness, which survives) versus what was only borrowed (body, possessions, relationships). The all-devouring one is also the great teacher of impermanence and detachment.\n\nEqually striking are the feminine qualities Krishna claims as His own: Kirti (fame), Sri (prosperity), Vak (speech), Smriti (memory), Medha (intelligence), Dhriti (firmness), and Kshama (forgiveness). All these are grammatically feminine in Sanskrit, and Krishna says these positive qualities manifest in people because of His presence. This teaching dignifies the feminine principle - the qualities that nurture, remember, articulate, persist, and pardon are divine signatures. Wherever you see these qualities - in any person of any gender - you see the Lord.\n\nToday, contemplate your relationship with death and loss. Rather than avoiding the thought, recognize: every moment something dies - a breath, an experience, a version of yourself. Can you see this continuous dying as divine teaching, constantly showing you what is essential versus what is passing? And notice the feminine qualities - in yourself, in others, in the world. When someone speaks wisdom, demonstrates memory, shows intelligence or forgiveness - these are not merely personal virtues but manifestations of the divine feminine. Ask: \"How does my relationship with impermanence change if I see death as divine teacher rather than enemy? Which feminine qualities do I most need to cultivate?\""

      ],
      "commentary": "We have been discussing chapter 10, and we are coming to its conclusion. So far we have seen that Bhagavan has been hammering on the same idea which has been discussed many times before in the Bhagavad Gita: that I am the source of all things and beings. The central theme of the Bhagavad Gita is that there is unity in diversity. Even though we see this world as a world of plurality — each individual different from each other, each thing different from each other — there is an unseen thread running through all things and beings, because they all come from the same source.\n\nSo there is similarity, there is something common to all. That's basically Bhagavan's theme. All throughout the Bhagavad Gita, he has been explaining that in various ways. And we have seen in the beginning of this chapter, Bhagawan reiterated: Aham Sarvasya Prabhavah Matta Sarva Pravartate — I am the source of all beings and everything proceeds from me. It is something like a scientist would say: everything started from the Big Bang in our universe, and everything which we see in this universe came from the Big Bang.\n\nSo when you and I are nothing but the product of the Big Bang — when there was nothing but hydrogen and helium, and now we have all this complex universe that we are trying to understand. If somebody comes out and says, \"That's all good, but explain to me how I can see evidence of the Big Bang in the universe,\" then people can start explaining: what you see in the galaxies — the hydrogen, the microwave radiation — it all comes from that original source. But you still have to give some examples. So here Arjuna says the same thing: I understood that everything comes from that supreme reality, You, the supreme reality.\n\nMany sages in the past have said the same thing, and you are also now saying it. I'm not doubting those sages, nor do I have any doubt in you. But can you give me some examples in my life where I can feel your presence in the world of objects and beings? That's what Bhagawan has given — these examples, somewhat reluctantly. \"Alas, I explained all of this, but you still want to know.\" It's like we all can learn the Bhagavad Gita and say that God is everywhere.\n\nGod has no form, God is not a man, he's not a woman. But that doesn't end it. I still want Bhagavan's Darshan, because we are stuck with our perception of reality. Our perception is limited by our mind, intellect, and senses. We also want to see Bhagavan in the image which we have created in our mind. Arjuna says the same thing.\n\nShow me evidence of your presence in my world. Bhagavan has given these 54 examples, starting from Vedic entities to Puranic ones, then natural phenomena and everything else you can think about, including some negative ones — Dandaha Damayatam Asmi, and among all the cheating and gambling. He wanted to convey to Arjuna: I am not just in the good; everything that's seemingly evil in your world also exists only because I exist.\n\nAnd then the last few verses are the conclusion of this chapter, where Bhagawan says: I have exhausted the examples which I can give you, but there is not really any end to this discussion. You can't continue to say, \"Just give me one more example, just give me one more example.\"\n\nSo he says: Yat cha Api Sarva Bhutanam Bijam Tat Aham Arjuna — whatever is the source of anything, I am that. Because anything in this world, as we have described, is an effect. When I see something which I can perceive through my senses, it's an effect. There has to be a cause, there has to be a source. You see a child — you know there are parents for that child.\n\nA child cannot exist without parents. So the parents are the source of the child. We see a pizza — we know there is a pizza maker somewhere. So everything we know has a source. And right now our conclusion is that everything has different sources. Wood comes from somewhere, steel comes from somewhere else.\n\nThen all this comes together and we build buildings. Bhagawan here says that whatever you see in this world is a being. \"Being\" means that which has existence, that which comes into being, which comes into existence in this space and time. I am the source, no matter what you see. Yat cha Api Sarvabhutanam Bijam, Tad Aham Arjuna. I am the primordial cause for all things and beings.\n\nWe understand this analogy of a seed and anything which comes out of it — a tree, an animal, a human being from a seed. But in that case, the seed is destroyed. After that manifestation is completed, when the tree comes into existence, that seed is gone. But in this case, that seed is immutable. It remains as the support for that manifestation.\n\nSo that cause remains as support for the effect. There are three laws of causation, Swamiji teaches. One of them says: if you remove the cause from the effect, the effect does not remain. You remove the cause from this universe, which is the Supreme Being, and the universe does not remain. The gold is the cause for the gold ornament.\n\nYou remove the gold from the gold ornament, and the gold ornament does not remain. Na Tad Asti Vina Yat Syat Maya Bhutam Characharam. Without me, the moving or unmoving cannot exist in this world. Just as if we remove the gold, the gold ornament cannot exist. So Bhagawan has basically concluded that all these examples are given for you to understand and to train your mind to start seeing things as they are.\n\nThey're all made up of the same material. This universe has one source. Eventually you can trace down the source to that one entity which remains immutable — the uncaused cause. There is no source for that cause. If you find a source for that cause, you can go further and find that source. So at one point in time, there will be a cause which has no cause.\n\nSo therefore Bhagavan said, I am that cause. And without that, nothing can exist. You remove that from this universe — it's like in my dream. My own thoughts are the source of my dream. But when I go into deep sleep, that dream cannot exist.\n\nBecause without my mind, which is the source, the dream cannot exist. Bhagawan here says the conclusion of all my examples is: I am the ultimate cause. I am the ultimate source of all things and beings. No thing, moving or unmoving, can exist without me. This is the very efficient way in Vedanta to explain that everything is included — when you say \"moving and unmoving,\" all sentient beings and all inert things are included. Nothing can exist without my presence.\n\nThere is no end to my Vibhuti. You cannot count all the manifestations. If you want to catalog all the manifestations of physical world, in this physical world, even that's not possible. So now we have in our science all this Webb telescope so we can see as far as possible. But let's say you want to catalog all the galaxies and all the stars in this universe. No matter what kind of a telescope you will have.\n\nThere are billions and billions of stars and millions and millions of galaxies. It's almost impossible. And by the time you catalog all of them, the new galaxies are formed and new stars are born, new old stars. It's a continuous change. Therefore, in Sanskrit it's called Jagat universe. But Jagat is that which is constantly changing.\n\nSomething which is constantly changing, there is no end to its manifestation. If it's constantly changing, you cannot count it. But by the time you catalog what you have known, new things come into existence. We were in high school, we thought, if I learn this physics and chemistry, then I'll be good at it. Well, physics and chemistry keeps changing in my own lifetime, so even that is not possible. Na antah asti mama divyanaam vibhuti nam paranti.\n\nBut there is no end to the divine glories, the physical manifestation of myself. But I told you some in detail just because you asked for it. Now you can figure out rest by yourself. Basically you teach somebody how to think, then the person can think himself rather than spoon feeding him. Give them example and then a person can learn on his own how to detect that. If you figure out if you are working in a jewelry shop and you figure out how to test a gold ornament, whether it is gold or not, once you have one example, you can then apply that on any other example.\n\nSo taking all these 54 examples, you have seen the method that anything which you see which has some excellence, that's because of the presence of that Lord. Now I told you all that you should be able to detect this. But in conclusion I can tell you. Yat Vibhuti mat satvam Srimat urjitam eva va tattat eva avagatschatvam mama tej ansa sambhavah. Whatever you see in this world, the world of your experiences, as Swamiji says that Jagat is not just the physical world which is changing outside the world of my experiences, world of my perception that is changing constantly, whatever in your perception, in your experience, you see as Vibhuti mat which has glory or its own excellence, Sattvam existence Sat is which is real, asat which is unreal. So Sattvam one context purity also that which has existence Srimat prosperous And Urjitam energetic.\n\nSo anything which you see in this world, in nature, in society, in your community, in your family, where you see these qualities, you should know that they are all coming from me alone. Tatta Eva Avagacvam Mama Teja Ansa Sambhavam. It's coming into existence because iota of my being. So don't consider that if I add up all this manifestation someday with some supercomputer and add it up, that will be Bhagavan. He said no, no, that will be just an iota of my being. Swamiji gives a very good example that my mind has all the capabilities.\n\nBut once in a while it gets confused or deluded by some random thought. And then it goes into a wrong direction. It creates this scenario which is unrealistic. That doesn't mean I completely have lost all my ability to think. My 99% of my ability is still valid. But right now it's dormant.\n\nIt's covered by the one delusion. But when that one delusion is removed, 100% of my ability will be back. So Bhagavan is Satchitananda is ever pure. But this manifestation, the Prakriti, the world of plurality comes into existence by just one part which creates this disturbance which they call the Hiranyagarva cumulative Vasanas. Of all the beings and things which are in this universe, that one portion is now creating a new world. So when I go to sleep, my world comes to an end.\n\nIn a deep sleep there is no world. I don't exist, world does not exist. But my Vasras are there in dormant form. That dormant vasanas will find the appropriate condition. My body has rested fully. I will wake up and they will all come back and manifest and create my own world.\n\nIn case of Ishvara also, Ishwara remains as pure as Brahman. But all the cumulative asanas of of the Jagat are still in a dormant form.",
      "reflection": "In a remarkable personal touch, Krishna declares: \"Vrishninam Vasudevah asmi, Pandavanam Dhananjayah\" - \"Among the Vrishnis, I am Vasudeva (Krishna himself); among the Pandavas, I am Arjuna.\" Krishna identifies with Himself and with His devoted friend! This is not ego but demonstration: divinity is present in the one who knows and the one who seeks to know. Among sages, He is Vyasa (compiler of the Vedas); among poets, Ushanas (Shukracharya). The capacity to organize wisdom and the capacity to express beauty - both are divine expressions.\n\nThe verse \"Yat cha api sarva-bhutanam bijam tat aham\" is the chapter's essence: \"I am the seed of all beings.\" Unlike an ordinary seed that is destroyed when the plant emerges, this divine seed remains - it is the immutable support for all manifestation. \"Na tat asti vina yat syat maya bhutam chara-acharam\" - nothing moving or unmoving can exist without Me. This is not arrogance but ontological fact: remove the cause from the effect, and the effect cannot remain. Remove gold from the ornament, and the ornament vanishes.\n\nToday, contemplate yourself as both the beloved (like Arjuna) and the manifestation of the divine (like Vasudeva). You are not merely a seeker but also that which is sought - the divine expresses through your very seeking. And see everything around you as effects whose cause is the same divine presence. The chair, the tree, the stranger on the street - all exist only because they are supported by that \"seed\" which is never destroyed. Ask yourself: \"If I am the Arjuna in Krishna's enumeration - chosen, beloved, identified with - how does that change my sense of spiritual worthiness? Can I see myself as both seeker and sought?\""

      ],
      "commentary": "We have been discussing chapter 10, and we are coming to its conclusion. So far we have seen that Bhagavan has been hammering on the same idea which has been discussed many times before in the Bhagavad Gita: that I am the source of all things and beings. The central theme of the Bhagavad Gita is that there is unity in diversity. Even though we see this world as a world of plurality — each individual different from each other, each thing different from each other — there is an unseen thread running through all things and beings, because they all come from the same source.\n\nSo there is similarity, there is something common to all. That's basically Bhagavan's theme. All throughout the Bhagavad Gita, he has been explaining that in various ways. And we have seen in the beginning of this chapter, Bhagawan reiterated: Aham Sarvasya Prabhavah Matta Sarva Pravartate — I am the source of all beings and everything proceeds from me. It is something like a scientist would say: everything started from the Big Bang in our universe, and everything which we see in this universe came from the Big Bang.\n\nSo when you and I are nothing but the product of the Big Bang — when there was nothing but hydrogen and helium, and now we have all this complex universe that we are trying to understand. If somebody comes out and says, \"That's all good, but explain to me how I can see evidence of the Big Bang in the universe,\" then people can start explaining: what you see in the galaxies — the hydrogen, the microwave radiation — it all comes from that original source. But you still have to give some examples. So here Arjuna says the same thing: I understood that everything comes from that supreme reality, You, the supreme reality.\n\nMany sages in the past have said the same thing, and you are also now saying it. I'm not doubting those sages, nor do I have any doubt in you. But can you give me some examples in my life where I can feel your presence in the world of objects and beings? That's what Bhagawan has given — 54 examples, somewhat reluctantly. \"Alas, I explained all of this, but you still want to know.\" It's like we all can learn the Bhagavad Gita and say that God is everywhere.\n\nGod has no form, God is not a man, he's not a woman. But that doesn't end it. I still want Bhagavan's Darshan, because we are stuck with our perception of reality. Our perception is limited by our mind, intellect, and senses. We also want to see Bhagavan in the image which we have created in our mind. Arjuna says the same thing.\n\nShow me evidence of your presence in my world. Bhagavan has given these 54 examples, starting from Vedic entities to Puranic ones, then natural phenomena and everything else you can think about, including some negative ones — Dandaha Damayatam Asmi, and among all the cheating and gambling. He wanted to convey to Arjuna: I am not just in the good; everything that's seemingly evil in your world also exists only because I exist.\n\nAnd then the last few verses are the conclusion of this chapter, where Bhagawan says: I have exhausted the examples which I can give you, but there is not really any end to this discussion. You can't continue to say, \"Just give me one more example, just give me one more example.\"\n\nSo he says: Yat cha Api Sarva Bhutanam Bijam Tat Aham Arjuna — whatever is the source of anything, I am that. Because anything in this world, as we have described, is an effect. When I see something which I can perceive through my senses, it's an effect. There has to be a cause, there has to be a source. You see a child — you know there are parents for that child.\n\nA child cannot exist without parents. So the parents are the source of the child. We see a pizza — we know there is a pizza maker somewhere. So everything we know has a source. And right now our conclusion is that everything has different sources. Wood comes from somewhere, steel comes from somewhere else.\n\nThen all this comes together and we build buildings. Bhagawan here says that whatever you see in this world is a being. \"Being\" means that which has existence, that which comes into being, which comes into existence in this space and time. I am the source, no matter what you see. Yat cha Api Sarvabhutanam Bijam, Tad Aham Arjuna. I am the primordial cause for all things and beings.\n\nWe understand this analogy of a seed and anything which comes out of it — a tree, an animal, a human being from a seed. But in that case, the seed is destroyed. After that manifestation is completed, when the tree comes into existence, that seed is gone. But in this case, that seed is immutable. It remains as the support for that manifestation.\n\nSo that cause remains as support for the effect. There are three laws of causation, Swamiji teaches. One of them says: if you remove the cause from the effect, the effect does not remain. You remove the cause from this universe, which is the Supreme Being, and the universe does not remain. The gold is the cause for the gold ornament.\n\nYou remove the gold from the gold ornament, and the gold ornament does not remain. Na Tad Asti Vina Yat Syat Maya Bhutam Characharam. Without me, the moving or unmoving cannot exist in this world. Just as if we remove the gold, the gold ornament cannot exist. So Bhagawan has basically concluded that all these examples are given for you to understand and to train your mind to start seeing things as they are.\n\nThey're all made up of the same material. This universe has one source. Eventually you can trace down the source to that one entity which remains immutable — the uncaused cause. There is no source for that cause. If you find a source for that cause, you can go further and find that source. So at one point in time, there will be a cause which has no cause.\n\nSo therefore Bhagavan said, I am that cause. And without that, nothing can exist. You remove that from this universe — it's like in my dream. My own thoughts are the source of my dream. But when I go into deep sleep, that dream cannot exist.\n\nBecause without my mind, which is the source, the dream cannot exist. Bhagawan here says the conclusion of all my examples is: I am the ultimate cause. I am the ultimate source of all things and beings. No thing, moving or unmoving, can exist without me. This is the very efficient way in Vedanta to explain that everything is included — when you say \"moving and unmoving,\" all sentient beings and all inert things are included. Nothing can exist without my presence.\n\nThere is no end to my Vibhuti. You cannot count all the manifestations. If you want to catalog all the manifestations of physical world, in this physical world, even that's not possible. So now we have in our science all this Webb telescope so we can see as far as possible. But let's say you want to catalog all the galaxies and all the stars in this universe. No matter what kind of a telescope you will have.\n\nThere are billions and billions of stars and millions and millions of galaxies. It's almost impossible. And by the time you catalog all of them, the new galaxies are formed and new stars are born, new old stars. It's a continuous change. Therefore, in Sanskrit it's called Jagat universe. But Jagat is that which is constantly changing.\n\nSomething which is constantly changing, there is no end to its manifestation. If it's constantly changing, you cannot count it. But by the time you catalog what you have known, new things come into existence. We were in high school, we thought, if I learn this physics and chemistry, then I'll be good at it. Well, physics and chemistry keeps changing in my own lifetime, so even that is not possible. Na antah asti mama divyanaam vibhuti nam paranti.\n\nBut there is no end to the divine glories, the physical manifestation of myself. But I told you some in detail just because you asked for it. Now you can figure out rest by yourself. Basically you teach somebody how to think, then the person can think himself rather than spoon feeding him. Give them example and then a person can learn on his own how to detect that. If you figure out if you are working in a jewelry shop and you figure out how to test a gold ornament, whether it is gold or not, once you have one example, you can then apply that on any other example.\n\nSo taking all these 54 examples, you have seen the method that anything which you see which has some excellence, that's because of the presence of that Lord. Now I told you all that you should be able to detect this. But in conclusion I can tell you. Yat Vibhuti mat satvam Srimat urjitam eva va tattat eva avagatschatvam mama tej ansa sambhavah. Whatever you see in this world, the world of your experiences, as Swamiji says that Jagat is not just the physical world which is changing outside the world of my experiences, world of my perception that is changing constantly, whatever in your perception, in your experience, you see as Vibhuti mat which has glory or its own excellence, Sattvam existence Sat is which is real, asat which is unreal. So Sattvam one context purity also that which has existence Srimat prosperous And Urjitam energetic.\n\nSo anything which you see in this world, in nature, in society, in your community, in your family, where you see these qualities, you should know that they are all coming from me alone. Tatta Eva Avagacvam Mama Teja Ansa Sambhavam. It's coming into existence because iota of my being. So don't consider that if I add up all this manifestation someday with some supercomputer and add it up, that will be Bhagavan. He said no, no, that will be just an iota of my being. Swamiji gives a very good example that my mind has all the capabilities.\n\nBut once in a while it gets confused or deluded by some random thought. And then it goes into a wrong direction. It creates this scenario which is unrealistic. That doesn't mean I completely have lost all my ability to think. My 99% of my ability is still valid. But right now it's dormant.\n\nIt's covered by the one delusion. But when that one delusion is removed, 100% of my ability will be back. So Bhagavan is Satchitananda is ever pure. But this manifestation, the Prakriti, the world of plurality comes into existence by just one part which creates this disturbance which they call the Hiranyagarva cumulative Vasanas. Of all the beings and things which are in this universe, that one portion is now creating a new world. So when I go to sleep, my world comes to an end.\n\nIn a deep sleep there is no world. I don't exist, world does not exist. But my Vasras are there in dormant form. That dormant vasanas will find the appropriate condition. My body has rested fully. I will wake up and they will all come back and manifest and create my own world.\n\nIn case of Ishvara also, Ishwara remains as pure as Brahman. But all the cumulative asanas of of the Jagat are still in a dormant form.",
      "reflection": "The chapter concludes with a teaching that shatters our usual way of thinking about God and world. After 54 examples, Krishna says: \"Na antah asti mama divyanam vibhutinam\" - there is no end to My divine glories. And then the stunning finale: \"Vishtabhya aham idam kritsnam ekamshena sthito jagat\" - I support this entire universe with a single fragment of Myself. All we see - every star, every being, every atom - is sustained by just a portion of the divine. The infinite remainder lies beyond our comprehension entirely.\n\nThis teaching serves two purposes. First, it prevents worship of manifestations as the ultimate - no matter how glorious something appears, it is only a fragment pointing to the whole. Second, it instills appropriate awe - if this vast, incomprehensible universe is merely one-fraction, what must the whole be? Like a single thread of a tapestry that goes on forever, what we experience is real but partial. Our task is not to catalog all divine manifestations (impossible) but to recognize the principle: wherever there is excellence, beauty, power, or truth, there is divine presence.\n\nToday, let this teaching reshape your perception. Look at everything you consider magnificent - towering mountains, brilliant minds, acts of extraordinary love - and remember: this is one fragment. The divine is not exhausted by any manifestation, no matter how grand. This should humble us (we cannot fully grasp the whole) and liberate us (we need not search elsewhere - the fragment before us is enough for recognition). Ask yourself: \"If everything glorious I have ever witnessed is only a fragment, what does this tell me about seeking 'more' versus appreciating what is present? How would my life change if I truly saw each moment as a window onto the infinite?\""

      ],
      "commentary": "We have started discussing Chapter 11, Vishwarupadarshan, the Vision of the Cosmic Form. Up till now in Bhagavad Gita, we have learned that all of us are trying to liberate ourselves from our sorrows. In the very first chapter, we defined our condition. From my perspective, life is full of sorrows and joys, but they don't come as cleanly defined as we would like them to be. Sorrows come with a little joy, and joys come with a little sorrow.\n\nEverything that is positive comes with a little negative, and everything negative has some positive in it. The very first chapter defined our condition. To get out of this, we are trying all our means to overcome these limitations. In the first five chapters, we define who we are and from what perspective we are seeing our life, and therefore why we have these limitations. We have seen that we are defining ourselves by our accomplishments, our relationships, our abilities, and also our limitations.\n\nFrom that perspective, when I see the world, I'm a minuscule being and the world is out there to get me. The vast world out there is the Karma Falada -- the field of my activity -- and I have very limited control over what comes out of my actions. In that situation, I constantly try to find what is right and what is wrong, what is appropriate and what is inappropriate, but I can't find a clear definition. From chapter two onwards, we have seen why that perspective is not correct.\n\nThat perspective -- me looking at myself from a very narrow angle -- is creating all this confusion. If I change the perspective about who I am, which Bhagavan clarifies in chapter two, I learn that you are not who you think you are. This mortal self is not you but your equipment. My body, my mind, my intellect -- these are my equipment, but not me. I consider them to be me and associate all their limitations as my limitations. Up to chapter five, we learned what that equipment is all about and how using it in this world effectively will get me to where I want to be, which is a state of complete bliss. Then we learned the art of meditation in chapter six -- how to meditate upon that other self which I have not experienced yet, but which is my real self.\n\nSo the quest from chapter 7 onward is to define that Self -- the self which I have not yet identified with, but identification with which will end all my sorrows and limitations. We have learned that that self is the Almighty, all-pervading self. That self is none other than the self which I consider to be myself, the one self which constantly reminds me that I exist. That self is the same self as the self outside. But the change of perspective is what I need.\n\nSo how do I get to that was the topic of chapter 10. How do I now start identifying with that higher self? By seeing that self in everything and every being. In chapter 10, the Vibhuti Yoga, Yoga of Divine Glories, we have learned that Bhagavan says there anything glorious, splendid, powerful, wonderful, you see in this world. Consider that is that because of me, the self in it. So the theme of chapter 10 was that I am the origin and dissolution of all the being.\n\nAham Sarvasya prabhavaha matthaha Sarva Prabhartate. When you take that statement -- that everything is pervaded by me -- it basically tells me that everything is one and the same. Nothing is different from I, because the I pervades everywhere. There is no space left. If you say I pervades only in sentient beings, then it is a different story. But this I pervades everywhere.\n\nAham Atma guda kesa sarva asyas thetah. I'm seated in the hearts of all beings. I'm the core of all beings and things. So we have learnt and have an intellectual appreciation. Now, the knowledge in our life comes from three different sources. One is Pratyaksa Pramana.\n\nYou can keep telling me that it is night outside. You are hallucinating where I personally can see. That's the Pratyaksha Parama. I infer where there is smoke, there is fire. So chapter 10 gave me all the inferences. How can I claim that there is electricity in this room?\n\nI said, don't you see the lights are on? That means electricity is on. It's an inference -- it does not say that I can see electricity. All my knowledge about electricity comes from inferences: the heater is on, lights are on, air conditioning is working. But my Pratyaksha Pramana will be when I put my finger in that outlet. No words are necessary. No description is necessary. That's Pratyaksha Pramana -- seeing is the closest I can come. So our Shastra, the Sankhya philosophy, accepts three sources of knowledge.\n\nFirst, Pratyaksha Pramana -- perception through my senses. Second, inference -- from my observation, I deduce that this must be the truth. And third is testimony -- somebody comes and tells me what it is. Most of our knowledge about Bhagavan comes from testimony only, so far. My parents told me Bhagavan is like that.\n\nAll religions tell me Bhagavan is all-pervading. Swamiji even said Bhagavan is all-pervading. Who am I to doubt him? So I'm relying totally on testimony right now about Bhagavan, from a lineage of all the gurus. They are telling us that the Atma is the Paramatma.\n\nWho am I to question them? I have complete faith in them, in the testimony. How does a judge ever decide what is right and what is wrong? Who is guilty, not guilty. He relies strictly on testimony, because he is hardly ever there at the scene of crime. Only in some very unique case does he happen to be there. Otherwise, he never has any other means of knowledge other than testimony. That's why the oath is taken: truth and nothing but the truth. So I can rely on testimony if I trust the testimony. So far we have trusted the testimony of Bhagavan. Aham Atma Guda Kesas Sarva -- that is his testimony. He says so, and unless we doubt him, we don't have any reason to doubt him. So we say okay, that's fine. Then he said, \"If you don't believe me just on my word, look everywhere around you and see all this power and glory. That power and glory will not be there if I am not there.\" So anytime I see something splendid.\n\nAnytime you go out into nature, something awesome strikes you. Right away you have that sense of awe about the divine in nature. How wonderful this nature is! Because this exists, there must be God. Because nature has laws, there must be a lawgiver. And because the laws are implicitly followed, there must be a law enforcer.\n\nWe have never met him. But we know if I jump from the 14th floor window, Mother Earth will receive me. As Newton figured out. But that's still not good enough for me to vouch for his presence. What I want is seeing is believing. So Vishwarupadarshan is the final experience all of us are seeking.\n\nIn spite of my complete faith in Bhagavad Gita and Swami Chinmayananda, the only time I can come and tell you Bhagavan exists is if I experience him. Therefore, now Arjuna says Mat Anugrahaa Paramam Guhiyam Adhyatma Sangin Matanughaya Paramam. Out of your great compassion for me -- not that I was deserving, not that I did something special. A mother does something for a child not because the child is deserving, but out of complete compassion. Yat Paya Uktam -- out of great compassion for me, you have given me this secret knowledge about the self. You told me about what the Self is all about.\n\nIn chapter two you told me that you are not that mortal being. You are the immortal being. All beings are immortal. The self in them is immortal. All bodies are destroyable, perishable. But the self in those bodies is immortal.\n\nYou told me this great secret, which can only be transmitted when there is a great teacher and a very eligible student. Otherwise the secret remains secret. Teachers may come and tell you, but you will never learn. My delusion is gone by this discourse. This knowledge that you have given me out of your great compassion for me.\n\nSo that confusion about who I am and what my duty is -- am I a soldier, a general? Or am I a brother, a grandson, and a student? What is more important, my duty as a general or my duty as a family man? That delusion is gone. The field of action changes, but I, the actor, remain the same.\n\nSo depending on the field of action, I should be working accordingly. I can think about architecture when that is my field. I can't start giving clients a discourse about Bhagavad Gita -- they will go away! The delusion is gone. I now know what is right and what is wrong.\n\nHowever, Bhava Apyayo hi Bhutanam Srutao Vistara Shomaya. Let me also tell you what I understood so far. That Bhava Apya origin and dissolution of beings in Bhutanam Sruta Vistara Somaya. I heard in detail which you told me Kamala Patraaksa Mahatmyam Apicha Avyam that it is the eternal self which is the origin and dissolution. Ishvara the Lord is the resting place and the source of all the beings. Also Mahatmyam Apicha Abhyam.\n\nThen also your great glories. Then I heard you the Isvara. I heard Your glories. He addresses Krishna Kamalapatra as one who is lotus eyed. Now obviously in our culture lotus eyed is considered beautiful. But there is another implication here.\n\nThat you are seeing this world as a lotus eyed. In other words, the lotus remains pure no matter what the condition of its being. You the self remain unattached to all this prakriti that you have in detail described to me how this world functions. But you remain completely detached of that. I understood that part also. I understood who I am, what my duty is.\n\nNow I also understood your nature as the Ishwara and how you remain detached from all the workings of this Prakriti. Evam etad yatha ATH tvam atmanam parameshwara. Thus you have described Eva metat. So be it or so it is. Evam eta yatha atma as you said what we just discussed that you are the source of all the beings and you are the dissolution of all the beings. That includes myself as well.\n\nYou describe to me that you are the source of all the beings. You are the dissolution of all the beings. However, Drastu mitchami -- I want to see it. I understood. There is no question anymore about the teaching. However, I want to see it for myself. The sense of sight is the most dear to us, because seeing is believing. I may close my eyes and I may hear my granddaughter. But that doesn't mean that she is here. Somebody put recording. I want to see what I'm hearing is correct or something else I'm hearing. That's why I want to have the direct experience.\n\nOnly then can I vouch for it that your nature is such. I am understanding and accepting, with no doubt, the testimony you have given. And all of this -- including Narad Muni, Kavi Ushna, and all the people we have talked about -- is testimony I've taken for granted. As for inference, you told me to see everywhere in this world as you. I also understood that. But I still need my direct experience. Pratyaksha Pramana. Drastumi Chami Terupam Ayeshwaram -- I want to see that splendid form of yours where everything is included in it. Right now I only have a very narrow perspective. When we look at photographs of any building, we are only seeing a part of it.",
      "reflection": "Arjuna declares that his delusion is gone after hearing Krishna's teachings, yet he still yearns to see the cosmic form directly. This reveals a profound truth about spiritual growth: intellectual understanding, while necessary, is not the same as direct experience. Consider the three sources of knowledge mentioned in these verses - perception (pratyaksha), inference (anumana), and testimony (shabda). Most of our spiritual knowledge comes from testimony - what teachers, scriptures, and traditions tell us. But like Arjuna, we long for that direct perception, that moment when \"seeing is believing.\"\n\nReflect today on the gap between what you intellectually know and what you have actually experienced. You may understand that all beings share the same consciousness, but do you feel it when interacting with a difficult colleague or a stranger on the street? Arjuna's honesty is instructive - he does not pretend to have realized what he has only understood conceptually. Practice this honesty with yourself: Where in your spiritual journey are you relying purely on faith and testimony? What would it mean to move from hearing about the unity of existence to actually perceiving it?\n\nAs a daily exercise, when you encounter any moment of excellence or beauty today - a sunset, a kind gesture, a moment of insight - pause and ask yourself: \"Am I merely inferring the divine here, or can I directly perceive the source behind this manifestation?\" Let this question bridge the gap between knowledge heard and wisdom realized."

When he started in the first chapter saying, \"I cannot kill these people even if I get killed,\" Bhagavan said in the second chapter that the self cannot be killed.\n\nThe self in you is imperishable, immutable. The self in you is the same self in everyone else. So one who thinks he is a slayer and one who thinks he is slain -- both are wrong, because it is like within myself: I cannot be both slayer and slain of my own self. Arjuna said, now I'm very clear. My confusion about what my self is, that is gone. However, I'm still at a level where I cannot comprehend the unity of all beings.\n\nI understand. I can also experience my own self. I'm very aware of myself. I can now theoretically understand that as my self is imperishable, your self is also imperishable. However, that oneness of the self is beyond my understanding. If you really look at this point of the Bhagavad Gita, we are exactly at the same level -- all of us who have been sincerely seeking to understand the nature of the self.\n\nAll this is intellectually understood. But when it comes to realizing, myself and yourself is one and the same understanding falls apart from experience. My experience is very different in day to day life. I know everything about myself and how I feel, but I cannot relate to yourself and how you feel. Therefore, Arjuna said, I am very clear. You have also explained to me how the things come into being and how they perishes all comes out of the same self and perishes back into the same self.\n\nIt is very clear to me. However, this oneness of the Lord, the glory of the supreme Self -- to be perceived as one and not as many -- is beyond my control right now. And that's the hurdle in the path of my realization. Right now I'm in a constant samadhi about myself. This conditioned self which I think is me requires no effort to realize. It's automatic knowledge. As soon as a baby is born, he or she knows \"this is me\" and everyone else is someone else.\n\nSo that's an automatic knowledge. We're conditioned by that. The conditioned self has conditioned us to think who we are. The knowledge given to us by the sages telling us that no, this conditioned self is not the only nature of yourself. Yourself is omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient. You're just conditioning it and making it limited yourself.\n\nOnce you let go of those limitations, you will identify with the Supreme Self. And that's where Arjuna says, I have a difficulty. I can't experience that. I want to experience that form of the self -- your form. You claim to know that supreme form of the self. I know this limited form of the self; you know the supreme form.\n\nI need to see that to get over the hurdle. So he said, drastumi chami te rupam aishwaram purushottamam. O Lord of all the beings. Purushottam, I want to say that form of yours where everything is included in one. I see myself as separate. The world is separate.\n\nThe world of plurality is very easy for me to comprehend. But I want to see all in its totality. That if you think that it is possible for me to see. So Bhagavan said, okay, I think you are ready for it. You come to that level of understanding that the only barrier left is your own intellect. The only barrier left is your own conditioning.\n\nYou have accepted fully that my self and the selves of others are one and the same. By inference, we have come to the conclusion that we cannot be anything but part of the same self. If the Lord created this universe out of his Self -- no other material was available to him, and both the universe and the Lord exist -- then the material for this universe is the Lord's Self. If my self is created out of the Lord's Self, then my self and his self cannot be different. So is the case for everything else which I see.\n\nHowever, that oneness which I should feel -- which I am feeling in my own body, in my own limited self -- I have complete oneness there. There is never an argument about the left hand versus the right hand, no argument about the right eye versus the left eye. If one is weak, the other takes over. You don't even realize when that happens, because there's a complete oneness in it. But that's not happening with my family members or my community members. If someone is suffering, to some extent I will help, but not to the extent that I would help myself.\n\nArjuna said, let me see that oneness with all beings. In Verse 5, Sri Bhagavan Vacha Pashame Partharu Pani Satasa Athah Sahastra Saha Nana Vidhani Divyani Nana Varana Krutinicha. Krishna says: I will let you see my form which has hundreds and thousands of forms in it, various types of divine shapes and colors. In my own being you will see hundreds and thousands of forms -- the forms which you have seen till now and forms which you have not seen -- in a flash, all at once. So you will see hundreds and thousands of forms, various colors, various types, and various shapes. And in the next verse he says Pashya, Aditya, Rudra, Asvinau, Marutahata, Bahuni, Adristha, Purvani, Pasha, Acharyani, Bharada.\n\nHe said, not only will you see the forms you are familiar with, but you will also see forms you are not familiar with. Not only the forms and beings which you want to see in one, but also the divine beings which you have been worshipping as someone other than this world. All these deities they were worshiping in Vedic times -- Aditya (Surya), Rudra (basically Shiva, the aspect of destruction in the Trinity), Vasu, all these various deities of nature, Maruta the wind God -- all the gods which you have been worshipping, you will see them also in the same being. Currently your understanding is that this is Mrityu Lok. We are the mortal beings, and the divine beings are separate. So we worship the divine beings as mortals.\n\nAnd they seem to be completely different from myself and the selves of the people in the mortal world. But Bhagavan says, when you see them -- those divine beings -- all will be part of the one self, my own self, your own self. And you will see all that. Then Bahuni Adrishta Purvani -- even things you never imagined or thought about before, Sacchara and Achara, the moving and unmoving beings, you will see as one self. Yacha Anya Drastum Ichasi -- he says, here in this one location, everything is complete without leaving anything out. The whole universe centered in one being, including all the moving and unmoving.\n\nAs I said, you will see all these things, plus whatever else you desire to see. Because, you see, we always have a conception of divinity. A Hindu will say, when Bhagavan appears, in what form will he come? Either Rama or Krishna or Shiva -- and that too in the same form as we have been seeing in calendars and pictures. If he comes in a different form, we don't accept him as Bhagavan. He has to have the mukut and all those things. So, whatever you want to see, you will see in myself.\n\nHowever, the technical difficulty is that you won't be able to see it with your natural eyes. Natu maam shakya seydrastum anay neva swachakshusa Divyam dadami teksuhu pashame yogameshwaram. No matter how much we are taught to look at the world differently, unless we change our way of seeing things, we'll always go back to seeing what we were seeing before. To learn new things and to look at this world in a different way, we have to change our perception. So Divyam dadami tejaksho -- I'm giving you this divine vision, meaning I'm going to change your way of seeing things.\n\nThe way of my seeing things right now may be well, I am this and you are that. After about two generations we call ourselves, we are Indians and they are Americans. Somebody says, are you not American also? You're an American citizen. You had been living here for like 30 years. No, no, I'm an Indian or I'm an American, but I'm Indian.\n\nTill I change my perception of seeing myself as part of this country, as an American, I will never be able to see myself as part of it. Nothing changes, but my perception about seeing things changes. That perception change is very much required. Go outside right now. The way you see this world, no matter how much I tell you to see it as one -- we can say the space is in the room, or the room is in the space. I can continue seeing this space in the room until I start visualizing that the space is everywhere, including in this room. And that visualization has to change.\n\nThe perception has to change to see what Arjuna wanted to see. So now Swamiji says, what is it that stands between my perception and the unity of myself and yourself? There are two things. One is, I am separated from you by the space between us. This conditioned self and that conditioned self have a space between them.\n\nSo as soon as we have this perception of space, we create this world of plurality. This space, just like anything that we can imagine, is an imaginary thing. Is there space in existence? When you put two things, a space is created between two things. If you remove both, there is no space. Space can only be seen in relationship to the objects we perceive.\n\nHow much space is between you and me can only be defined by first defining where you and I are. If you remove \"you\" and \"I,\" there is no space to be measured. So this space is a conception of my mind. Once I conceived of myself as an entity separate from you as an entity, the space was created. And then the second thing which separates myself and others is time.\n\nI met such and such person yesterday, but he's not here today. So I'm separated from him by time. My father lived in a different time. I'm living in a different time. I'm separated by time.\n\nFrom Einstein onward, we know time is nothing but a concept of our mind. Time depends on the position of the observer. When we say we are seeing the same thing at the same time, it depends on where you and I are. We see the stars at night and say, \"That star is doing this right now.\" But we know the light takes many, many years to come here. So what we see today actually existed many years ago, but we consider it \"now.\"\n\nWe consider that in the past. We consider what we'll see tomorrow is in future. Now all this thing is dependent on my station point in life. My time is defined by my conditioning.",
      "reflection": "In these verses, Krishna promises to show Arjuna forms \"by hundreds and thousands, various in kind, in colour and in shape\" - including the Adityas, Vasus, Rudras, Ashvins, and Maruts. But crucially, Krishna warns that Arjuna cannot see this with his ordinary eyes - a divine vision (divya chakshus) must be granted. This points to a fundamental limitation we all face: our programmed way of seeing the world keeps us trapped in duality. We are conditioned from birth to see \"I\" as separate from \"the world,\" and this conditioning acts like a filter that obscures unity.\n\nConsider how your perception creates your reality. The same situation can be seen as a threat by one person and an opportunity by another - nothing changes except the way of seeing. Krishna is essentially telling Arjuna: \"I will change your paradigm, not the world itself.\" What paradigms or mental filters are you currently looking through? How might your relationships, work, and daily experiences transform if you could truly see through a lens of interconnection rather than separation?\n\nToday, practice shifting your perspective intentionally. When you see individual objects - trees, cars, people - try to also perceive the space that contains them all. When you notice differences between yourself and others, simultaneously recognize what you share: consciousness, the desire for happiness, the experience of being alive. This practice of holding both perspectives - the many and the One - is the beginning of developing that \"divine sight\" Krishna speaks of."

      ],
      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 11, Vishwarupadarshan. We discussed that after listening to the glories of the divine, we, at least as seekers, understand how to see divinity in the world of plurality with respect. But at the same token, we all have the exact same issue: even though I can intellectually appreciate this, even though I can see the argument about the unity of all things, that's not my personal experience. My personal experience is something other than that. I do feel very clearly separated from the world as an entity. And that's exactly Arjuna's opening question.\n\nBasically saying that I am completely satisfied with your explanation. Out of your compassion, you give it to me, you explain to me your glory. I also understand that you are the source of everything and you will be the resting place for everything. However, I want to see all that into one. All that vision I need to see. It is a one unified vision where I feel that oneness with this world.\n\nWith that request, Bhagavan said, yes, I can show you that because you are ready. A seeker reaches a point where he really wants to know -- and that's where Arjuna is now. Krishna is saying, you are at that point where I can show you this. However, no matter how hard you try, you will not be able to see this with your normal eyes. In other words, the way you are trained or programmed to see this world as separate individuals will not allow you to see the unity. We are programmed right from our birth: this is me, this individual limited being is me, this body and mind-intellect is me.\n\nOur psyche is programmed to see that way. As long as we see the waves in the ocean as individual waves, not part of the ocean, we won't see the unity. Unless you change the perspective, the perception, the paradigm, you will not be able to see the unity. Therefore, you will not be able to see this with your normal eyes. I have to give you a divine Drashti -- divine eyes, another way of looking at this world than you are used to. The same thing can be seen by two different people, and one person sees something in it while the other person sees something else. It all depends on my perspective, on how I see things. You know those riddles: what do you see in this picture? Do you see a glass, or do you see two people facing each other? It depends on whether you're seeing the negative space or the positive space. So Bhagavan said, I need to change your way of seeing, and so I will give you a Divya Drashti.\n\nAnd we obviously know that at the same time, when Arjuna gets Divya Drashti, Sanjaya automatically gets it too, because he already had the divine vision given to him -- the ability to see what's happening on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. Not only can he see what's happening physically on the battlefield, he can also peer into the minds of the people who are fighting that battle. So he can see what Arjuna sees. He can also feel what Arjuna feels. And he can narrate all of this to his audience. So Bhagavan fulfilled his promise and told Arjuna, I will let you see the cosmic form.\n\nIn other words, seeing this entire cosmos as one. Right now, we see the entire cosmos as, at a minimum, two: I and the cosmos. Even though I theoretically know that myself is not outside this cosmos or this world, when I become an observer, I exclude myself from the observed, which is the world. That perception was created the day I was born, when the first thought \"this is me\" arose. The I, the ego, was born and associated with this limited being. It excluded me from everything else which I observe as an observer.\n\nAnd to remove this, I need to first remove the I-ness. So the different perception which Bhagavan is giving him is to combine all these things into one. As we say, the only thing which divides us is the space between you and me, and the time between me and others. Take these two concepts out of my perception, and the world becomes one entity. If there are droplets of water on my table, each droplet has its own existence because it is divided from the other droplet by space.\n\nBut we know they came out of the same glass of water. Once the identification with the droplet is developed, two droplets become individuals, and they are apart from each other. Bhagavan said, I need to change your perception. It's not that I'm going to change the world -- I'm going to change your perception. With this normal, programmed perception of yours, you will never be able to see oneness.\n\nTherefore, temporarily, I want to take this limitation away from you. As long as I'm programmed to see this space as room space, I will have difficulty combining it with the universal space outside. But if I change my perception and look at it from outside, then I can combine them. A good example would be: we are walking down Knuckles Road and you can see the trees all separated. You go a little further up to a bird's eye view, and the streets start coming together. When you are at 15,000 feet in an airplane flying from Richmond Airport and look down at Richmond, it looks like one big entity -- everything becomes part of it. Right now from ground level, everything is individual. Every building has its own identity, every street has its own identity, every lamp post has its own identity. Just go to 15,000 feet above and have a view -- all these merge into one complex. You go even further up, and all things merge into completely one.\n\nBhagavan is taking Arjuna into that 25,000-foot view of this cosmos. So then what Arjuna saw, Sanjaya saw through Arjuna's eyes and mind. What follows is Sanjaya's honest attempt to tell Dhritarashtra what Arjuna is experiencing. Verses 9, 10, and 11 say: Evamuktva tatvarajan Maha Yogeshwaro Harihi Darsaya Maa Saparthaya Paramam Rupam Aishwaram. Having said that Arjuna will not be able to see this with his normal perception, that his perception must change, and that Krishna will help him do that -- now, having said this, O Rajan, O King, the Maha Yogeshwara Hari, because he was the Lord of the Yogas, could do that for Arjuna.\n\nRight now I'm connected with my world, with my limited perception, but the Lord of Yoga can change my connection. Maha Yogeshwara Harihi -- Hari is one who removes ignorance. He is the Yogi who can connect this mundane state of existence with that universal state. He is the Lord of Yoga. He showed Arjuna -- Dasaya Masparthaya Paramam Rupam Aishwaram -- the supreme form of his being.\n\nBasically, this just confirmed that Krishna fulfilled his promise to Arjuna to show him the cosmic form. The next verse is Sanjaya's quick attempt to paint what he is seeing through Arjuna's eyes for Dhritarashtra. So he says Anek Vaktra Nayanam Anek Adhut Darshana. When we are overwhelmed by something, we can't really go into detail about what's happening. \"Oh, I think there's chaos here. People are running around.\"\n\nThink of the description of 9/11 -- in the first few hours there is panic, fear, the cloud, the smoke coming out. People are running in the streets. Nobody knows what's happening. But generally, this is what I can say. The first journalist has to narrate to the world what's happening, and if it's on radio and not on TV, he can only describe impressions. So Sanjaya says Anek Vaktra Nayanam: I see many mouths and many eyes.\n\nAnek Adbhut Darshanam -- there are so many wonderful sights. Adbhut means something which I have not seen normally. In this one form of the Supreme Being, I see many mouths, many eyes, and many wonderful sights. Anek Divya Abharanam -- many divine ornaments. Divya Aneko Yata Yudham -- and many divine weapons uplifted.\n\nObviously he's seeing the whole thing on the battlefield, so the first thing that comes to his mind is the weapons. Many mouths, many hands, many wonderful sights, many different types of clothes, and many different weapons lifted. People are ready to kill each other, but there are not separate people here. One being, in his Supreme form -- I see all of that all at once.\n\nDivya Mallya Ambaradharam -- he continues because he doesn't know where to start and where to end. He said, many mouths, all of this, and not only that, but I'm seeing Divya Mallya Ambaradharam. Typically the things we notice: divine garlands, divine clothes. Divya Gandhanulaipanam -- with very divine fragrance. All the lepas, the pastes you apply. Obviously in our culture there is a lot of paste-applying, so very different types of paste.\n\nSarva Ascharimayam Devam Anantam Vishwato Mukham -- everything is so fascinating. There's nothing normal about it. I can't say, \"Remember last time we went to such-and-such, and it was something similar.\" I can't do that. There is no experience I can relate to this vision of the Supreme. That's why he is grabbing a word from here and a perception from there and just throwing it at Dhritarashtra, saying, \"That's what Arjuna is experiencing right now.\"\n\nI don't know whether you can comprehend or not. Divya Mallya Ambaradharam Sarva Aschariyamayam Devam Anantam -- this divine vision is Anantham, infinite. It's not something I can say starts here and ends here. Arjuna wanted to see the cosmic form in Krishna. He says, show me your cosmic form. Krishna obviously is finite.\n\nHe stands here and Arjuna stands here and the army is all around him. It's not that this vision is limited to the form of Krishna, however tall he was. This is infinite. What Arjuna is seeing is infinite. There is no end to it. There is no beginning he can see.\n\nThere is no end he can see. All he sees is hundreds and thousands of mouths, legs, clothes, malas, lamps, weapons, and wonderful sights. Everything is fascinating. I have nothing I can explain to you. Anandam Vishwa Tomukham -- facing all sides. Vishwa, the cosmos, is facing everywhere. In other words, this is something that cannot be limited to Krishna's being.\n\nThis vision is beyond any perception that we have ever had. As we have been discussing in Bhagavad Gita, the simple quest in life for any being is to exist. This is the basic instinct. What we want to preserve out of everything else is our existence. Therefore, this fear of death -- that my existence is temporary, that it began at my birth (time T1) and will end at my death (time T2).\n\nAnd as I always say, those two events are hypothetical. Nobody has ever experienced their own birth and death. But I have come to this conclusion from inferences, Anumana. I have seen other people being born and I have seen other people dying. Therefore, I have come to the conclusion that my existence is temporary. Remember the very old song.\n\nMaybe Anil will remember. Ae zindagi ki mele e zindagi ki melee Dunyame kam nahonge upsource. Hum nahonge upsource. I wish I will be there, but I will not be there. All this wonderful world will continue and I wish I would be there, but I will not be there. That's my biggest fear.\n\nThat's my essential quest in life to exist. And then we heard from Bhagavan in last few chapters.",
      "reflection": "These verses mark the pivotal moment when Krishna grants Arjuna the divine vision and Sanjaya begins narrating what unfolds. Krishna declares: \"Here in Me living as one, O Arjuna, behold the whole universe, movable and immovable.\" The key insight is that we normally see ourselves as observers separate from what we observe. The moment the ego was born in us - that first thought of \"this is me\" - we excluded ourselves from everything else. To see unity, this sense of separation must temporarily dissolve.\n\nThink about how you constantly position yourself as an observer of life rather than a participant in its wholeness. When watching news of a disaster, do you feel \"that is happening to them, not me\"? When celebrating another's success, is there a subtle sense of \"their gain, not mine\"? This observer-observed split is the fundamental illusion Krishna is removing from Arjuna's perception. The divine vision combines all things into one - not by changing the world, but by changing the way of seeing.\n\nFor today's practice, experiment with dissolving the observer-observed boundary. When you look at a tree, instead of thinking \"I am seeing the tree,\" try experiencing \"seeing is happening.\" When in conversation, rather than \"I am listening to you,\" sense simply \"listening is occurring.\" This subtle shift - from \"I\" doing something to simply experiencing awareness itself - offers a glimpse of what it means to see the universe \"living as one\" within the divine. Notice what changes when you are no longer the separate observer but simply awareness witnessing itself."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 11, Vishwarupadarsha Yoga of Cosmic Form. So far we have seen in Bhagavad Gita that the quest for each individual is to understand who Bhagavan is. We try in different ways to conceptualize Bhagavan. And we typically hear that people want to see Bhagavan as a person. But all philosophers basically tell us Bhagavan is not a person -- he's not a man, he's not a woman, he's not it, he's not he, he's not she. So how one can conceptualize Bhagavan is a riddle.\n\nIf you see the Abrahamic religions, they forbid any picture of God. What God looks like is not possible to depict. Therefore they say, do not draw. Do not create an image which can falsify the image of God in your mind. Our religion, on the other hand, makes a very daring attempt to describe Bhagavan. So chapter 11, by Bhagavan Ved Vyas, is a great attempt to describe what Bhagavan would look like if you ever have his darshan.\n\nSo far we have seen that Arjuna said: I have understood everything you have said -- that Aham Aksaram Brahma Paramam, I am that imperishable being, I am the source of things and beings. I have no doubt. He said Etat Atha -- that means, so be it. I understood, no question about it. I'm convinced that this is what your nature is, that you are the source of all beings. But how do I contemplate upon you?\n\nHow do I meditate upon you? Because you told me: meditate on myself, and you will become myself. So Bhagavan Ved Vyas takes us on Arjuna's journey and asks, how does he see it? Arjuna makes a request, and Bhagavan grants it and says, okay, I will show you my total form that nobody has seen before. But you won't be able to see it with your natural vision. I have to give you a divine vision.\n\nI'll give you a divine perspective. With your perspective today, you will not be able to understand this. The things themselves don't change -- but when we change our perspective, we see things in a very different light. Things we have only seen from one narrow perspective suddenly look different.\n\nSo right now we are seeing the world from our narrow perspective of I, the limited being. Then conceptualize what would be that greater self. We are part of the plurality. We want to experience singularity. Bhagavan Krishna told Arjuna, I will change your vision. And Bhagavan Bedya has already given that divine vision to Sanjaya.\n\nSanjaya can see everything that is happening on Kurukshetra. And whatever Arjuna sees, he sees too. So Sanjaya saw the form and described it to Dhritarashtra, as we have seen in the last few verses. He confirmed: yes, Krishna granted this vision to Arjuna. He said Anek Vaktra Nayanam, Anek Adbhut Darshanam, Aneka Divya Abharanam. Everything I see in my world is included in it.\n\nI see various types of dresses, various types of ornaments, various types of fragrances. All that he is saying is Anek vaktra Nayanam. As we have discussed last time, if I take the concept of space out of my mind by some magic, then everything will lump into one. All hands will be of that one big body of a person. And all hands are his, all mouths are his, all eyes are his. Because now I'm seeing it from my world's perspective.\n\nWe always see things from our own perspective. We see things based on what we already know. So if I have to describe something which you have not seen before, I can only describe it from the perspective of what you already know. Do you know where Short Pump is? I don't know where Short Pump is. Do you know where that Walmart is?\n\nOkay, well, that's Short Pump. You need a reference point you already know to get you to Walmart, and then you can put together in your mind what that place should look like. So now, as Bhagavan is giving Arjuna this vision, Sanjaya is putting together in his mind what he has seen in his world: many mouths, many hands, many different types of dresses, many different types of fragrances. Aneka Divya Abharanam.\n\nThen he says, Divya, Mallya, Ambar, Dharam, same thing. Whatever I have seen in my world, I Now see in that form and Sarva ascharimayam Devammanantam everything is very wonderful and infinite. I cannot describe what it is from our perspective. When we try to put together things in one vision, it looks really infinite. We try to find out how wide this universe is. We have to simply say it's infinite.\n\nBecause we can't really imagine it. We see the stars, we see the moon. But what is the nature of the cosmic infinite, Anant? Now, if I really take my gaze from my world to the outer world, then he says what you see is Yadibaha Divi Surya Sahasrasya Bhavet Yukpat Uthita. In my world, I see one sun rising every morning, and I know the splendor of that sun.\n\nThat splendor is incomparable. In my world, there's nothing I can compare to the sun's splendor. When we design light, designing a surgery room, we have to mimic the sunlight. So you have to come close to the sunlight from your artificial light. You are still only talking about the sunlight. As we experience this far away from sun.\n\nBut to experience the sun where it is and to look at it directly -- it's splendid. We can hardly look at it. Now imagine that all the space between all the stars is removed, and all the stars, all the suns in this cosmos, all come together. The splendor of that entity -- all the thousands of stars together! We can look at the sky and look at the stars because they're so far away. By the time the light comes to us, it's so feeble that they look like twinkling stars.\n\nBut if they all come together -- because you have removed space and time from your mind -- they all come together at the same time. Therefore, Divi Surya Sahasrasya Yadi Bhaha: if thousands of suns were rising in the sky, if you can imagine that -- Sadrushi Sat Bhasah Tasya Mahatmanaha -- even that cannot describe the splendor of that great being, that Mahatma. Because he is the stars, he is the moon, he is everything that we can think of. Therefore, we cannot draw his picture.\n\nBecause everything that I can imagine as part of this cosmos, Bhagavan said, it is me. Then this is my Eightfold prakriti that includes everything they can think of. Bhoomi apah analaha kam vayuhu mana buddhi ahanka. So space is part of that manifestation, everything else I can imagine. Now, if I say that I have Bhagavan's darshan, all that darshan has to come together in one. Therefore it is not possible.\n\nBut what we try to do as human beings is personify all that divinity in one person. So therefore he said, Bhagavan, I'm seeing this vision in your body. Even in our life, what we do is take all the divinity that we can think of or we have imagined, and we assign that to one person. We want to see it all in one person. So therefore we say, \"Bhagavan, I see all that in Swami Chinmayananda,\" somebody says. \"I saw all that in Bhagavan Rajneesh,\" somebody else says. Because we gather all that conceptualization of divinity and want to see it in one person.\n\nAnd then we get disappointed because a person by very nature cannot have all the attributes of that entire divinity. But if we change our perspective, then we will be able to see that. So Bhagavan said, yadibaha divi Surya Sahastrasya Bhavet yukpat Uthita Sadrushi saa saad Bhasah Tasya mahat manah. The splendor of that being which represents totality is like thousands of suns. You cannot describe it. Tatra Ekastam, Jagat Krishnam, Pravibhaktam, Anekata -- it's all centered into one.\n\nBecause that's what Arjuna asked for. I want to see all that centered into you, all in one. Right now I see them as Pravibhakta, different parts. I know this cosmos exist as nature, as Lord's manifestation, but in different parts I can manage. I can manage to understand. It is your world, his world, her world, my planet, different planets.\n\nThere are different parts of his manifestation. From my narrow perspective, I can understand it. But now he says, Tatra Ekastam is centered into one Jagat Krushnam. The entire Jagat Jagat includes everything. Jagat includes your physical cosmos as well as your emotional cosmos and your intellectual cosmos. Everything that you can think of that the greatness of our Hinduism, it has included in Astra, Prakriti, mind, intellect and ego.\n\nWithout that, your world is not complete. If I can put all this together, one person and what that vision would be, that's what Arjuna is seeing right now. In that Mahatma Deva Devashya Sari re. Arjuna saw in the body of the God of Gods. Krishna is no longer a person. Dhritarashtra can relate to who he knew as the king of Yadavas or Pandava's ally.\n\nBut now he says he's a Deva Devasya, the God of all the gods. So he said, I see the Maruta and I see Rudras, all these Devas, all the deities which he is the God of all those deities. Everything that we have imagined, who has the control over this world, he has control over all of them. Deva Deveshary, Pandavahatada, Pandava Arjuna. Arjuna saw in the body of that God of gods this splendor of thousands of suns blazing at the same time. So what could be the reaction of Arjuna Vishma Yavista overcame by the wonderment?\n\nHe's completely dumbfounded. Rustiroma is here standing on hands. I don't know if the English translation of in our language it's very well used. Goosebumps is the only thing come to my mind in English. He's having goosebumps. He's completely dumbfounded looking at this.\n\nHe asked for it, but did not know what to expect. Now he's seeing in the body of the God of Gods, because all that vision is personified in one person. Ristiroma Dhananjaya Dhananjaya again Arjuna Pranasya Silasadvam. Once you have that experience, as soon as you see him in his true nature -- Pranamya Sirasadevam -- as soon as he realized the nature of this total being, he is completely surrendered. We don't surrender right now because we don't think this is all true, even though we kind of learn and all that.\n\nBut when it comes to our life, we say, no, no, I have better control. I have people come to me and say, stop coming to class. They think it was actually giving them less motivation to do things in the world. So right now our motivation in working in the world is that we don't have much trust in him. We don't think he can take care of it. I really need to look out for myself, look out for number one.\n\nThat used to be a mantra when I came to this country. Somebody said, think about number one. Number one is you -- start from thinking about yourself first, then comes everybody else. Your family, your children, and so on. Start from you, take care of yourself first and then go to others. But here Arjuna realized that he is nobody compared to what he is seeing. He is insignificant in relation to this cosmic form.\n\nSo Pranaam Sirasa Devam Dandavat Pranam -- he does full prostration. Pranamya Sirasadevam. Once you have understood the greatness of who you are relating to, you are completely surrendered to him.",
      "reflection": "Sanjaya attempts to describe the indescribable: countless eyes and mouths, mystic forms innumerable, divine ornaments, celestial weapons, and a radiance compared to a thousand suns blazing simultaneously. This famous verse - \"divi surya sahasrasya\" - has inspired countless seekers because it points to something beyond ordinary comprehension. When we try to imagine even one sun's full brilliance (which we cannot look at directly), multiply that by a thousand, and realize this still falls short of the divine splendor.\n\nThe teaching here is about the limitations of description and the necessity of direct experience. Sanjaya can only use references Dhritarashtra knows - ornaments, weapons, forms, colors - to describe what transcends all categories. Similarly, when we speak about ultimate reality, we can only point toward it using familiar concepts. This is why the vision cannot be transmitted through words alone; it must be experienced. Notice how your own spiritual understanding may be limited by the concepts and images available to you.\n\nToday, try this contemplation: Imagine removing all the space between every object in your visual field - all the stars, all beings, all things compressed into one point of infinite density. What would remain? The \"thousand suns\" metaphor suggests pure, undifferentiated radiance - consciousness itself before it manifests as particular forms. When you see any light today - sunlight, a lamp, a candle - let it remind you that this visible light is merely a pale reflection of the light of awareness that illuminates all your experiences. Ask yourself: What is the light by which I see this light?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 11, Vishwarupadarsha Yoga of Cosmic Form. So far we have seen in Bhagavad Gita that the quest for each individual is to understand who Bhagavan is. We try in different ways to conceptualize Bhagavan. And we typically hear that people want to see Bhagavan as a person. But all philosophers basically tell us Bhagavan is not a person -- he's not a man, he's not a woman, he's not it, he's not he, he's not she. So how one can conceptualize Bhagavan is a riddle.\n\nIf you see the Abrahamic religions, they forbid any picture of God. What God looks like is not possible to depict. Therefore they say, do not draw. Do not create an image which can falsify the image of God in your mind. Our religion, on the other hand, makes a very daring attempt to describe Bhagavan. So chapter 11, by Bhagavan Ved Vyas, is a great attempt to describe what Bhagavan would look like if you ever have his darshan.\n\nSo far we have seen that Arjuna said: I have understood everything you have said -- that Aham Aksaram Brahma Paramam, I am that imperishable being, I am the source of things and beings. I have no doubt. He said Etat Atha -- that means, so be it. I understood, no question about it. I'm convinced that this is what your nature is, that you are the source of all beings. But how do I contemplate upon you?\n\nHow do I meditate upon you? Because you told me: meditate on myself, and you will become myself. So Bhagavan Ved Vyas takes us on Arjuna's journey and asks, how does he see it? Arjuna makes a request, and Bhagavan grants it and says, okay, I will show you my total form that nobody has seen before. But you won't be able to see it with your natural vision. I have to give you a divine vision.\n\nI'll give you a divine perspective. With your perspective today, you will not be able to understand this. The things themselves don't change -- but when we change our perspective, we see things in a very different light. Things we have only seen from one narrow perspective suddenly look different.\n\nSo right now we are seeing the world from our narrow perspective of I, the limited being. Then conceptualize what would be that greater self. We are part of the plurality. We want to experience singularity. Bhagavan Krishna told Arjuna, I will change your vision. And Bhagavan Bedya has already given that divine vision to Sanjaya.\n\nSanjaya can see everything that is happening on Kurukshetra. And whatever Arjuna sees, he sees too. So Sanjaya saw the form and described it to Dhritarashtra, as we have seen in the last few verses. He confirmed: yes, Krishna granted this vision to Arjuna. He said Anek Vaktra Nayanam, Anek Adbhut Darshanam, Aneka Divya Abharanam. Everything I see in my world is included in it.\n\nI see various types of dresses, various types of ornaments, various types of fragrances. All that he is saying is Anek vaktra Nayanam. As we have discussed last time, if I take the concept of space out of my mind by some magic, then everything will lump into one. All hands will be of that one big body of a person. And all hands are his, all mouths are his, all eyes are his. Because now I'm seeing it from my world's perspective.\n\nWe always see things from our own perspective. We see things based on what we already know. So if I have to describe something which you have not seen before, I can only describe it from the perspective of what you already know. Do you know where Short Pump is? I don't know where Short Pump is. Do you know where that Walmart is?\n\nOkay, well, that's Short Pump. You need a reference point you already know to get you to Walmart, and then you can put together in your mind what that place should look like. So now, as Bhagavan is giving Arjuna this vision, Sanjaya is putting together in his mind what he has seen in his world: many mouths, many hands, many different types of dresses, many different types of fragrances. Aneka Divya Abharanam.\n\nThen he says, Divya, Mallya, Ambar, Dharam, same thing. Whatever I have seen in my world, I Now see in that form and Sarva ascharimayam Devammanantam everything is very wonderful and infinite. I cannot describe what it is from our perspective. When we try to put together things in one vision, it looks really infinite. We try to find out how wide this universe is. We have to simply say it's infinite.\n\nBecause we can't really imagine it. We see the stars, we see the moon. But what is the nature of the cosmic infinite, Anant? Now, if I really take my gaze from my world to the outer world, then he says what you see is Yadibaha Divi Surya Sahasrasya Bhavet Yukpat Uthita. In my world, I see one sun rising every morning, and I know the splendor of that sun.\n\nThat splendor is incomparable. In my world, there's nothing I can compare to the sun's splendor. When we design light, designing a surgery room, we have to mimic the sunlight. So you have to come close to the sunlight from your artificial light. You are still only talking about the sunlight. As we experience this far away from sun.\n\nBut to experience the sun where it is and to look at it directly -- it's splendid. We can hardly look at it. Now imagine that all the space between all the stars is removed, and all the stars, all the suns in this cosmos, all come together. The splendor of that entity -- all the thousands of stars together! We can look at the sky and look at the stars because they're so far away. By the time the light comes to us, it's so feeble that they look like twinkling stars.\n\nBut if they all come together -- because you have removed space and time from your mind -- they all come together at the same time. Therefore, Divi Surya Sahasrasya Yadi Bhaha: if thousands of suns were rising in the sky, if you can imagine that -- Sadrushi Sat Bhasah Tasya Mahatmanaha -- even that cannot describe the splendor of that great being, that Mahatma. Because he is the stars, he is the moon, he is everything that we can think of. Therefore, we cannot draw his picture.\n\nBecause everything that I can imagine as part of this cosmos, Bhagavan said, it is me. Then this is my Eightfold prakriti that includes everything they can think of. Bhoomi apah analaha kam vayuhu mana buddhi ahanka. So space is part of that manifestation, everything else I can imagine. Now, if I say that I have Bhagavan's darshan, all that darshan has to come together in one. Therefore it is not possible.\n\nBut what we try to do as human beings, we personify that reason in one person. So therefore he said, bhagavan, I'm seeing this vision in your body. Even in our life, what we do is all the divinity that we can think of or we have imagined of. We assign that to one person. We want to see that in one person. So therefore we say, bhagavan, I see all that in Swami Chinbananda somebody says, I saw all that in Bhagavan Rajneesh, somebody says, because we gather all that conceptualization of divinity into one person, we want to see that in one person.\n\nAnd then we get disappointed because a person by very nature cannot have all the attributes of that entire divinity. But if we change our perspective, then we will be able to see that. So Bhagavan said, yadibaha divi Surya Sahastrasya Bhavet yukpat Uthita Sadrushi saa saad Bhasah Tasya mahat manah. Splendor of that being which represents totality, heirs of thousands of sons. You cannot describe it. Tatra Ekastam, Jagat Krishnam, Pravibhaktam, Anekata, it's all centered into one.\n\nBecause that's what Arjuna asked for. I want to see all that centered into you, all in one. Right now I see them as Pravibhakta, different parts. I know this cosmos exist as nature, as Lord's manifestation, but in different parts I can manage. I can manage to understand. It is your world, his world, her world, my planet, different planets.\n\nThere are different parts of his manifestation. From my narrow perspective, I can understand it. But now he says, Tatra Ekastam is centered into one Jagat Krushnam. The entire Jagat Jagat includes everything. Jagat includes your physical cosmos as well as your emotional cosmos and your intellectual cosmos. Everything that you can think of that the greatness of our Hinduism, it has included in Astra, Prakriti, mind, intellect and ego.\n\nWithout that, your world is not complete. If I can put all this together, one person and what that vision would be, that's what Arjuna is seeing right now. In that Mahatma Deva Devashya Sari re. Arjuna saw in the body of the God of Gods. Krishna is no longer a person. Dhritarashtra can relate to who he knew as the king of Yadavas or Pandava's ally.\n\nBut now he says he's a Deva Devasya, the God of all the gods. So he said, I see the Maruta and I see Rudras, all these Devas, all the deities which he is the God of all those deities. Everything that we have imagined, who has the control over this world, he has control over all of them. Deva Deveshary, Pandavahatada, Pandava Arjuna. Arjuna saw in the body of that God of gods this splendor of thousands of suns blazing at the same time. So what could be the reaction of Arjuna Vishma Yavista overcame by the wonderment?\n\nHe's completely dumbfounded. Rustiroma is here standing on hands. I don't know if the English translation of in our language it's very well used. Goosebumps is the only thing come to my mind in English. He's having goosebumps. He's completely dumbfounded looking at this.\n\nHe asked for it, but did not know what to expect. Now he's seeing in the body of the God of God because he's all that vision is personified in one person. Ristiroma Dhananjaya Dhananjaya again Arjuna Pranasya Silasadvam. Once you have that experience, as soon as you see him, Chamatkar I may not believe anything about when he does Chamatkar, he takes out a Rolex watch and gives you namaskar right there. So Pranamya Sirasadevam, as soon as he realized the nature of this total being is surrendered. We don't surrender right now because we don't think this is all true, even though we kind of learn and all that.\n\nBut when it comes to our life, we say, no, no, I have better control. I have people come to me and say, stop coming to class. I think it was actually giving him less motivation to do things. So right now our motivation in working in a world is we don't have much trust in him. We don't think he can take care of it. I really need to look out for myself, look out for number one.\n\nThat used to be a mantra when I came to this country. Somebody has started and said, think about number one. Number one is you start from thinking about you first, then comes everybody else. Your family, your children, your. Start from you take care of yourself first and then go to. But here he said he realized that he is nobody with whom he is relating to what he is seeing Nobody.\n\nSo Pranaam is Sirasa Devam Dandavat Pranam Only the South Indians do that Dandavat Pranayama Punjabi is doing Mathotic they just put the head on and Gujaratvi yeah Pranamya Sirasadevam, Once you have understood the greatness of who you are relating to, you are completely surrendered to him.",
      "reflection": "In these verses, Arjuna sees the entire universe with its manifold forms \"all embraced in One\" - the supreme Lord. His response is immediate and visceral: dumb with awe, hair standing on end, head bowed, hands clasped in salutation. He sees all the powers of Nature, the various creatures, the Progenitor Brahma on his lotus throne, the Sages, and the shining angels. Notice the dramatic shift: the moment Arjuna truly perceives Krishna's nature, spontaneous surrender arises. He does not decide to bow; bowing happens naturally.\n\nThis points to why we do not surrender in daily life - we have not truly seen. We may intellectually accept spiritual teachings, but when push comes to shove, we still believe we have better control, that we need to \"look out for number one.\" Arjuna's goosebumps and spontaneous prostration show what happens when intellectual understanding becomes direct perception. The teaching suggests that true surrender is not an act of will but a natural response to genuine recognition of the divine.\n\nReflect today on your relationship with surrender. When you say \"Thy will be done\" or \"I trust the universe,\" is it genuine recognition or merely words? Notice the situations where you grip tightly, trying to control outcomes. Ask yourself: What would I need to truly see for surrender to arise spontaneously? Consider that perhaps you are not lacking in willingness to surrender but in the clarity of perception that makes surrender the obvious and natural response. Practice today by consciously acknowledging your limitations in even small matters - traffic, weather, others' moods - and notice if a sense of release naturally follows this honest recognition."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 11, Vishwarupadarsha Yoga of Cosmic Form. As we have seen so far, in the beginning, Arjuna made the request saying that my delusion is gone now. Out of compassion, you explained to me that you are the source of all beings. You are the resting place of all beings. Nothing exists which is away from you. Everything I see is the manifestation of you alone.\n\nSo now my delusion is gone about what is right and what is wrong. However, I would like to see that form of yours in its totality in one place. In the previous chapters we have seen his Prakriti Astada Prakruti. So you can say you can experience, you are seeing it every day. His Eightfold Prakriti, you are experiencing and seeing every day. But I still can't see it in one place.\n\nI basically see as the plurality what I want to see as one entity. That's basically what we are all struggling with. Intellectually, we understand what Bhagavad Gita says. But when it comes to day-to-day life, it is very difficult to comprehend. So Arjuna said, my delusion is gone. I understand, but I want to see it, I want to experience it.\n\nAnd in response, Bhagavan said that if you wish to, I will show you, but you will not be able to see it from your present way of looking at the world, from your present eyes. You will not be able to see it the way you see the world right now -- it will remain divided. Because right now I see my world as I, an individual, and everything else as individual entities. If I see it that way, I will never be able to see the unity in them. If I change my perspective and see it from the singularity's point of view, and include myself in it, then I'll be able to see it.\n\nThat's you have to change your perspective. So I'll give you that perspective. Divyam Dadami te Chakshuhu. I'll give you that vision and then you will be able to see. Having said that, he showed the Swarupa, and Sanjaya was the witness. He confirmed that, yes, Yogeshwara Krishna showed Arjuna his Virat Swarupa. And Sanjaya described on his own what Arjuna saw: Aneka Vaktra Bahu -- many mouths and many hands, as if thousands of suns were blazing in the sky at the same time. It is so resplendent and difficult to see. He also showed us Arjuna's reaction: having seen that, Arjuna -- Pranamya Shirasa Devam -- as soon as he saw who Krishna in his real form is, he basically completely surrendered to him. And then what he said is this.\n\nNow we are discussing from verse 15 onward. As we have discussed before, the Bhagavad Gita is generally in Anushtup Chanda. But these verses are in Trishtup Chanda, because there is more to describe. So these are much longer verses, with more words packed into each verse. This is beautiful poetry, a prayer describing the nature of the Supreme Being. From Arjuna's perspective, when he sees that Swarupa, he sees things which are common to his experiences. When we go to any other town -- like we went to New York and I say I'll go to Manhattan -- what am I going to say?\n\nI'm going to see the buildings, 911 memorial, One World Tower, because that's the world I see is what Manhattan is all about. So now what Arjuna sees in that Swarupa is what he is familiar with. He says, pasyami Devan Tava Deva, Deva Sarvantatham Bhuta Visesanga O Deva. He doesn't say Krishna anymore, but O resplendent Being. I see in your body all the other Devas. In this Puranic culture, we have assigned deities to each force of nature, and those resplendent beings, the Devas -- he said, I see in your body all of them.\n\nPasyami Devan, Tava Deva Dehe. In your body I see them all. Tatha Bhuta Visesa Sangana, various groups of other beings. Brahmanam Isam, Kamala, Sanastha -- and I see the Lord Brahma. Swamiji looks at it both ways. He said, this could mean Lord Brahma, or it could mean Brahma and Isha -- Brahma and Shiva -- Kamala Sanastha sitting on the lotus. I see the whole creation in you, and I see the Creator himself.\n\nYou are the creation and you are the creator. I see everything all in one. Tatahu Rishis Cha Sarva -- and I see all the rishis. It's like everything is flashing through his eyes. Everything he has learned about divinity in this world is flashing at the same time. And also Uragan Cha Divyan -- and I see also the divine serpents.\n\nSwamiji points out here that this is one of the techniques poets use -- to take you to the most sublime level and then bring you all the way down to the lowest of the low. So I see all the divine beings, including the Lord Creator himself, but also all the serpents. The entire universe, from the lowest of the low to the highest of the high -- I see in your body at one time. And then he says Aneka Bahu Udar Vaktra Netra. Sanjaya has already described that before to Dhritarashtra.\n\nNow Arjuna himself says: I see infinite hands. Bahu -- hands, Udara -- stomachs, Vaktra -- mouths, Netra -- eyes. Pasyami tvam Sarvato Anantarupam: I see you facing everywhere. He is now realizing that this is not something he will be able to describe. Infinite mouths, infinite hands, infinite eyes. As we have discussed earlier, once you take the space out of our world and keep all the beings lumped as one...\n\nRight now I have two hands and you have two hands. But when you are together there are many hands. All the hands in this world are his hands. All the legs in this world are his legs. All the mouths in this world are his mouths. He is experiencing that.\n\nBut then he says, anywhere I see -- you know, like a 360-degree movie projected all over. You are focused on one side, and what happened to the other side? Still the same movie, just different parts. But we can't describe where that movie starts and where that picture ends. We actually went to the 9/11 memorial. They have a presentation on three sides.\n\nWhen people enter, they start putting their strollers against those walls as if they're just walls. Then someone comes and moves all of them because the movie is going to play on all three sides. Then we are focusing on one wall and realize, oh, there are details I'm missing on this side. And then, what about that side? We realized we will never be able to capture all three sides at the same time. It's beyond my capacity to see all three sides at once.\n\nSo Arjuna is experiencing something at a much grander scale and says, I will not be able to describe everything that I can see. Pasyami tvam Sarvato Anantarupam -- I see you everywhere with infinite forms. There is no end to what I see in you. Naantam Namadhyam Napunah Ta Adim -- we have learned this before in previous chapters.\n\nBhagavan himself said: I don't have any beginning, I don't have any end. I am the resting place of everything. Now Arjuna tells him: Bhagavan, I see you as you are -- no end, no beginning, no origin. Pasyami Vishweshvara Vishwaroopa -- he is accepting the fact that you are the Lord of all the universe, and this is your Vishwaroopa.\n\nThis is your infinite form. What I'm experiencing now is your real nature: you are beginningless, you have no middle and no end. Wherever we stand is the ever-present. Whatever we left behind is our past. What we have not yet experienced is our future.\n\nBut if we experience all of it at the same time, there is no beginning, no end, no past, no future. So he's seeing everything in his present. You are the Lord of the whole universe and I am seeing your Vishwaroopa. Kiritinam Gadhinam Chakrinam Cha -- as Swamiji explains here, Arjuna is now recognizing that what he's seeing is the divine form he always perceived as the Lord. Kiritinam Gadhinam Chakrinam Cha Tejo Rashim Sarvato Diptim Anantam: I see you with the crown, the club, and the discus -- the universal form of Vishnu with his four hands holding a lotus, a club, a discus, and a conch.\n\nAnd then he is wearing the crown. Only one who has complete control of his self can wear the crown. Vishnu is the only one who has complete control of the self. Therefore he wears the crown, which means he has the authority. We wear the crown temporarily. Whenever I feel I am in authority, I wear my crown. But that only lasts for a limited period of time. My authority slips away before I even realize. My authority is like the cardboard crown in a drama. While I'm on this drama stage, I have that cardboard crown. As soon as I'm off this stage, the crown is gone. Vishnu carries that authority all the time. That's why he wears the crown. So he holds the lotus which signifies purity and knowledge. And then he has a conch to wake you up from your ignorance. If you don't listen to the call for waking up, then he uses his club, the gada, to shape you up. And if you shape up, all well and good. If not, the chakra will annihilate you, just destroy you. So that's how the creation and maintenance continue. Bhagavan gives you all the chances to shape up. If you don't shape up, time will take care of you.\n\nSo Arjuna sees that form as the totality. Kiritinam Gadhinam Chakrinam Cha Tejo Rashim Sarvato Diptim Anantam -- a mass of radiance. Sarvato Diptim -- blazing everywhere. In the previous verses, Sanjaya says it is like a thousand suns blazing in the sky. Here Arjuna says Tejo Rashim Sarvato Diptim Anantam -- everywhere it's blazing. And Swamiji explains that what he's seeing is not the light of any sun, but the light of the self, the consciousness, that which illumines everything. Anant Diptim -- infinite teja.\n\nSo he is experiencing resplendence of the self. Pasyami tvam Durniriksham Samantha. But it is difficult to see. It is difficult to perceive the light of consciousness itself. Through the light of my consciousness, I understand everything. I see all these things -- Kiritinam Gadhinam Chakrinam Cha -- the crown, the club, the discus. But seeing the consciousness itself, your splendid being, is difficult to see directly. From the light of my consciousness, I can describe everything. But describing my consciousness itself is not possible. So Dur Niriksham -- I cannot grasp it. Dur Niriksham Dipta Anala Arka Dyutim Aprameyam.\n\nThat light is blazing all around like fire and sun, and it's incomprehensible. He comes to the conclusion that what he is seeing is undefinable. At the same time, whatever I want to see, I'll see in it. In any museum or gallery, we go and look at the pictures.\n\nEvery visitor will see something different. Even in our world, we see what we want to see. We'll never see the things we do not want to see. As soon as we see something which is not conducive, we will run away from it. Many years ago, when I first started working on a forensic lab and medical examiner's office, the first time I met with them they shared statistics about how many people go through an autopsy, how many people die. And the statistics showed something like one in four persons goes through an autopsy.",
      "reflection": "Arjuna declares three profound realizations: he sees the Lord everywhere with \"no beginning, no middle, no end\"; he sees the radiance that is difficult to gaze upon, \"glowing like blazing fire, brilliant as the sun, immeasurable\"; and he recognizes Krishna as \"Imperishable, the Sole One worthy to be known, the priceless Treasure-house of the universe, the immortal Guardian of the Life Eternal.\" The vision reveals that what we normally see as limited forms with clear boundaries - a beginning here, an end there - are actually expressions of something without any such limits.\n\nConsider how we normally perceive everything with boundaries: this person started here and will end there, this project has a deadline, this relationship has a history. We carve up reality into manageable pieces. But Arjuna now sees that these boundaries are imposed by our minds, not inherent in reality itself. The crown, scepter, and discus he sees represent complete authority (crown), the power to shape (scepter), and the wheel of time and action (discus) - symbols that Krishna is not merely present in the universe but is its controller, sustainer, and essential nature.\n\nFor your practice today, look at something you consider \"complete\" - a finished task, a relationship that ended, a chapter of life that closed - and contemplate: Where exactly did it begin? What conditions led to those conditions? Trace backward and notice how the \"beginning\" dissolves into endless prior causes. Then trace forward: How does what ended continue to influence the present? See how \"no beginning, no middle, no end\" applies even to ordinary experiences. This contemplation can soften the rigid boundaries we place on life events and open us to sensing the continuous, beginningless, endless flow of existence."

      "commentary": "We have completed chapter 10, Vibhuti Yoga, and we'll now be discussing chapter 11, Vishwarupadarshan, the cosmic form of the Divine. In the last chapter, Arjuna had asked Krishna: tell me how I should feel your presence, the presence of the divine, the presence of that all-pervading self, and how I can meditate upon that. In response, Bhagavan gave him various examples of excellence in this world from various walks of life -- applicable to Arjuna and also to us -- showing that from our day-to-day life, from our cultural backgrounds, from our spiritual quest, we find examples all around us of excellence and can feel the Lord's presence. As we discussed in chapter 10, anytime I see excellence, my mind recognizes it as God's blessings, the grace of God. In other words, divinity is evident in excellence. Bhagavan gave various examples for Arjuna and said, when you see this, it will remind you of my presence in all things and beings. I'm not limited to those excellent manifestations, but that's where you will find it easier to experience my presence.\n\nAnd now that Arjuna has heard that, he says: I'm still not experiencing that oneness, the oneness which you talk about throughout this discourse. I have intellectually appreciated it and come to the conclusion that that's what it is -- that there is one singular entity pervading this entire universe, which is you, the Supreme Self. But I need to have that experience. I would like to experience that oneness. This, as Swamiji explains, is similar to how we scientifically make any concept or theory our own knowledge. First I need to gather all the evidence and data.\n\nAnd then, once I have gathered all the data and evidence, I need to demonstrate that the phenomenon exists. I gather all information about how water is formed. In chemistry class, two molecules of hydrogen and one molecule of oxygen can create water. But at some point, I want to see the demonstration -- in the lab, I create that situation and then see how hydrogen and oxygen create water. In a similar fashion, Arjuna has now understood, but he wants to see a demonstration. So the chapter starts with Arjuna Vacha.\n\nArjuna said: Mat Anugraha Ya Paramam Guhyam Adhyatma Sangnitam Yat Tvaya Uktam Vachasthena Moho Ayam Vigato Mama. With your compassion for me, you have given me this secret knowledge. And as you have said, the self is indestructible, imperishable. One who considers himself to be the slayer or the slain -- in both cases, he is wrong. There is nothing to grieve over in the changes which take place in this world, including death, because death is not the end of existence. It is only the end of existence in the form of this body.\n\nSo Moho Ayam Vigato Mama -- by this discourse of yours, you have given me the secret knowledge. Bhavapyayo Hi Bhutanam Shrutao Vistaraso Maya Tvattah Kamala Patraksha Mahatmyam Api Cha Avyayam -- I have also heard the origin and destruction of beings, O lotus-eyed Krishna, from you, and also your inexhaustible greatness. I heard the greatness of the self, the supreme Brahman, that which is not limited by anything.\n\nAnd therefore my delusion is gone. I understand it clearly now. Evam Etat Yatha Attha Tvam Atmanam Parameshwara Drashtum Icchami Te Rupam Aishwaram Purushottamam. However, I would like to see that form as you described yourself -- that oneness in this world of plurality. I have understood that you pervade the entire universe and therefore there is no existence separate from you.\n\nHowever, at this time I cannot see that, and I would like to see that. I would like to experience that oneness of yours. Manyase Yadi Tat Shakyam Maya Drashtum Iti Prabho -- if you think it is possible for me to see that divine form, then, O Lord of Yogas, show me that imperishable form which includes everything in this world. I would like to see that complete form of yours where everything is in yourself.\n\nIt is easier for me to see your presence in this world of plurality. As Swamiji explains, it is easier for me to see gold in gold jewelry. I can take one look at it, experience the gold in it, then pick up another piece. As long as the excellence is there, in other words, the gold is apparent and not covered by something -- the gold is manifested in the jewelry -- I can see the gold in it. So it is easier to see the divinity in the world of plurality for us. What is not possible for us generally is seeing all the plurality in that one single entity. I can imagine that God is in you. God is in me, God is in He, God is in she. If my mind and intellect has achieved that level of purity, level of understanding, then I start seeing the divinity in all beings.\n\nAnd therefore, in our culture, when we meet each other, we say, namaste, Namah te, I bow down to you. I'm not bowing down to the limited self which is standing in front of me. Because I may have my own opinion about that person, but I still do. Namaste to all of the people I meet, at least culturally. That's what we should be doing or we are doing. Who we are bowing down to is the divinity in that person that I recognize.\n\nThe divinity in me and divinity in you is the same. So I respect the divinity in you. I bow down to you with that recognition. My transaction with you would be always of very friendly, very congenial, and not adversarial. Because I have recognized that myself and yourself has one thing in common, that consciousness, the divinity which makes me who I am. The same divinity, the same consciousness is within you.\n\nWhat I have trouble imagining or perceiving or seeing is that the whole divinity is one, and you and I are in it. And we have heard in Bhagavad Gita before, Bhagavan says, I am not in them, they are in me. The car is in the space, the space is not in the car. When I see a car which was built in Germany, there was space inside. When it was in Germany, there was German space. And they seal it tight and then transport that car to United States. Now the car is here, the space is still intact which was sealed in Germany. Now, whether the space in the United States is the German space or American space in the car -- obviously the answer is simple. The space inside the car is American space. So what happened to the German space which was in the car when it was sealed tight in Germany? The answer obviously depends on our way of seeing space.\n\nAs long as I see the space in the car, I have difficulty imagining what happened to that German space. When it came to America, the space was inside the car. The car was never opened till it came here. Well, it should still be German space in it, right? But if I start seeing that the space was not in the car, but the car was in the space, then I do not have any difficulty. The car was traveling in the space. And therefore wherever the car is, that country's space is in that car, because the car is traveling in the space. For me to imagine that, I have to first have a perception of space as a totality without any gap. If German space is one space and American space is another space, I will have difficulty. But if I can imagine a homogeneous, continuous, universal space, now I can see everything is in it. So what you and I have difficulty in recognizing is the unity between myself and yourself and herself, and also the objects in this room -- this is because of the distance between us. I am here and you are there, you are there and she is somewhere else.\n\nWhat is separating us from each other is the space. What is separating me from my father is the time. My father lived up to 1975 and I'm here today in 2014 thinking about it. So we are separated from each other by time. So there are two things which creates this world of plurality for me, and that is space and time. We have also heard from sages and scientists that this concept of space and this concept of time is creation of my mind.\n\nSo one can say, well, what is the distance between here and D.C.? It's too long a journey. And somebody else will say it's too close, it's only a two hour drive. So my mind creates the valuation of whether it's too far or too close -- that's the conception of space in my mind. Same thing with time. If somebody says I'll be back in half an hour, well, is it too soon for me or too long for me? I can't wait for half an hour.\n\nYou need to be back here in 10 minutes. Because my conception of time is different than his conception of time. For him half an hour is too short, and for me half an hour is too long. Well, anytime somebody goes to India for a vacation and when they come back, and if I ask that person, so how was your vacation? The answer is it was great, but it was too short. And I say, how long were you there?\n\nHe said four weeks. For me, that's too long a time. I only go there for a week or two. So for me a two weeks vacation is good enough, but for them four weeks is too short, because when you are enjoying yourself, four weeks seems too short. But if you were suffering because of the heat or monsoon and all the other things which we normally complain about, you'll say, boy, it was too long. I tried, and then I finally was ready to get out.\n\nSo even time is a concept of my mind. If these two concepts of my mind are wiped out, then I will see the world completely differently. If the concept of space is wiped out from my mind, then I will see you and I and everyone in this room come together as one entity. There is no space between us. We are all joined together and we will be one entity with different limbs, but we are all together. Swamiji uses a very good analogy in his commentary.\n\nThere is a toy maker making toys from clay. And he has various toys and various dolls: elephant, tiger, baby and a bird. And then he decided, no, this is not good. I need to use this clay for something much larger, more sellable. He takes all those dolls and compresses them into one ball of clay.\n\nAnd when he compressed them together, what he has done is taken all the space away from each other. Previously they were sitting on a table or in a display box as separate entities. Once he gathers them and lumps them into one, now it's a big lump of clay. At the same time, I can see the face of the elephant on the surface of that lump. I also see the baby's smile. I also see the tiger's face. What is taken away from each other is the space. The same way, the events in my life have a time value -- it was in my past, or it is in my present, or it will be in my future. My childhood is in my past. My youth is in my past. My old age is in my present.",
      "reflection": "These verses reveal the cosmic form as filling all space between heaven and earth, with the sun and moon as eyes, and a face beaming with sacrificial fire \"flooding the whole universe with light.\" Arjuna observes that all three worlds tremble with awe and fear at this vision, while celestial beings enter into the Lord - some invoking Him in fear with folded palms, while Great Seers and Adepts sing hymns saying \"All Hail.\" This shows that even enlightened beings respond to ultimate reality with reverence and wonder.\n\nThe key teaching here involves space and time as mental constructs that create our experience of separation. Swamiji's analogy of the toymaker is illuminating: when clay dolls - elephant, tiger, baby, bird - are compressed into one ball, all the space between them disappears, yet traces of each remain visible on the surface. Similarly, what separates you from your father is time; what separates you from your neighbor is space. Remove these mental constructs, and all beings merge into one entity. This is not philosophy but a description of actual perception when the divine vision is granted.\n\nFor today's practice, work with your perception of space. When you see a friend, recognize that the \"distance\" between you is a concept in your mind. When you remember someone who has passed, notice that the \"time\" separating you is also a mental construct. Experiment with the feeling of closeness to someone physically far away, or connection to an ancestor long gone. What changes when you treat space and time not as absolute barriers but as perspectives that can shift? This is the beginning of understanding how Arjuna could see \"the whole universe, movable and immovable\" within a single form."

Now, whether the space now in the United States is the German space or American space in the car, obviously the answer is simple. The space inside the car is American space. So what happened to the German space which was in the car when it was still tight in Germany? The answer obviously is in our way of seeing space.\n\nAs long as I see the space in the car, I have difficulty imagining what happening to that space which was German space. When it came to America, the space was inside the car. Car was never opened till it came here. Well, it should have been a German space in it. But if I start seeing that the space was not in the car, the car was in the space, then I do not have any difficulty. Car was traveling in the space.\n\nAnd therefore wherever the car is, that country space is in that car, because car is traveling in the space.

If somebody says I'll be back in half an hour, well, is it too soon for me or too long for me? I can't wait for half an hour.\n\nYou need to be back here in 10 minutes.

Well, anytime somebody goes to India for a vacation and when they come back, and if I ask that person, so how was your vacation? The answer is it was great, but it was too short. And I say, how long were you there?\n\nHe said four weeks for me, too long a time. I only go there for a week or two. So for me a two weeks vacation is good enough for them four weeks is too short, because when you are enjoying their four weeks seems too short. But if you were suffering because of the heat or monsoon and all the other things which we normally complain about, if I'm suffering. I'll say, boy, it was too long when I tried.

The same way the events in my life has a time value of it was in my past, or it is in my present, or it will be in my future. My childhood is in my past. My youth is in my past. My old age is in my present.",
      "reflection": "In these verses, Arjuna witnesses hosts of beings - Rudras, Adityas, Vasus, Sadhyas, divine healers, the Winds, demons and saints alike - all gazing at the cosmic form in amazement. Then comes a shift: Arjuna begins to feel overwhelmed and terrified. Seeing the stupendous form with myriad faces, innumerable eyes and limbs, and \"terrible jaws,\" he confesses: \"I am terrified. My courage and peace of mind desert me.\" The vision that began with wonder now reveals its awe-inspiring and fearsome aspect.\n\nThis is a crucial teaching about spiritual growth. We often approach the divine expecting only comfort, beauty, and peace. But the complete vision includes what we might call the \"terrible\" aspects - destruction, death, the dissolution of everything we hold dear. Arjuna wanted to see totality, and totality includes both creation and destruction, both the pleasant and the fearsome. His terror is the natural response of the ego when it confronts something that completely transcends its capacity to control or even comprehend.\n\nToday, reflect on what aspects of reality you resist seeing. Do you avoid thinking about death? Do you turn away from suffering in the world? Do you prefer a \"nice\" spiritual path without difficult truths? Arjuna's experience suggests that mature spirituality requires facing the full picture - not just the comforting divine but also the destroyer, not just light but also the consuming fire. Ask yourself: What would it mean to accept that the same consciousness that creates also destroys? That the God you pray to for protection is also the power behind everything that threatens you? Sitting with this paradox, without resolving it too quickly, is itself a spiritual practice."

But Bhagavan says, if I show you my Roop, it may not be as pleasant as you think. So Arjuna asked for it and he got what he wished for. Both concepts of space and time are wiped out from his mind. Now he sees this entire Jagat without any space, and also without any time difference. So first he described what he saw and said, I see that everything is within you. I see with many mouths, many hands, many stomachs, many legs. In other words, all the legs and all the mouths which I consider to be individually assigned to individual are all yours. I see them all into you.\n\nHe also saw everything that he has ever encountered in his life. Devas, all the deities -- I see all of them in you. So he described what he sees. Then he also sees the condition of other beings looking at this great form: all these people are entering into you. Some are fearful and some are praising your glory. Those who have not comprehended the reality are fearful of it. When we are not sure about the outcome of our actions in life, we are fearful. Those who are wise enough to not get perturbed by whatever the outcome is, they are blissful and praising the Lord because they have accepted everything. So I see those wise people are praising you, but others are entering into you in fear. And then he says, I also see you as Vishnu. I see you as that Almighty Vishnu. Kiritinam Gadinam, Chakri Namcha. With all your attributes, I see you. But then he says, I also don't see any middle, end or beginning. And all the space between the heavens and earth is filled with you alone. Up till now what I considered nothingness -- there is no such thing as nothingness anymore. Everything is you and you alone.\n\nSo I see you all around me and everything in you. And now I also see how the world is looking at you, how the other beings react. He still keeps himself out of this. He is an observer observing an object. His experience is all objective. Right now he is describing what's happening to others.\n\nThis is how we observe our world. We keep ourselves out of it and then say, oh, he is not doing exercise, he is going to be suffering, he is smoking, he is going to have cancer. We keep ourselves out of it. We look at the world and see how they are doing and how they are feeling and how they are behaving. So up to now he is looking at everything and saying, everybody is entering into you. Some are fearful, some are praising you.\n\nI see the deities, I see everything into. You are filling all the spaces. But then he starts having the other side of the experience. It's not all wonderful -- life has its positive moments and negative moments. And when you focus on one, you can always give a biography of a person showing how great he was and how accomplished he was.\n\nEvery funeral I go to, I realize there is not an average person in this world. Everyone says how great the person was, what he accomplished, and how loving he was. I have never heard somebody say, \"He was such an average person. He didn't really accomplish much in his life. He was a terrible husband, a cruel father.\" Because we focus on what is good in that person, we highlight all the goodness in him.\n\nSo up till now Arjuna was only focusing on the divinity. Then he sees Brahma seated on the lotus. All the deities are praising, all the vasavas and maruts and everybody is praising. And they are all dumbfounded just looking at this great. They're looking in wonderment. Even the wise person also gets awed by the nature.\n\nEven people like Einstein, who are pure scientists -- he could not figure out what God's game is all about. That's why he said, \"God doesn't play dice.\" He had complete faith that God wouldn't be doing something random. He had faith in God's laws of nature, that we can figure them out. This world is very predictable from our perspective; there's nothing unpredictable in this world, really. With that predictability, we can plan our life. I'll get up at 6 o'clock and then I'll do this, then I'll be at class at 10. We can plan that because it's predictable. Everything you can predict from when I leave my house. The unpredictable part is what will happen during that period. And once we look at that, we start getting fearful.\n\nWell, you can get in an accident. You are at Times Square walking around and somebody just drives a car onto the sidewalk. It's unthinkable, unpredictable. Unpredictable things do occur. So there is positive and there is negative. From our perspective, from our relative world, there is positive and negative.\n\nNow Arjuna, from his perspective, says what is also not so pleasant. He says: Nabhas Sprisham Diptam Anek Varnam Vyattananam Dipta Vishala Netram Drashtva Hi Tvam Pravyathitantaratma Dhritim Na Vindami Shamam Cha Vishno. Having seen your form touching the sky, inflaming with many colors, your open mouth and fiery eyes -- I am shaken up inside. I have no courage, no peace.\n\nUp till now, I had a place in this world where I had staked myself and said, \"This is where I am, and this is who I am in relationship to the world.\" The moment I feel insignificant anywhere -- in my organization, in my society, in my community, in my family -- I start getting depressed. We keep our balance by having that self-assessment of ourselves as an important being. The moment we drop that, we become completely fearful. We do not know where we stand. That's why when people retire, they often lose their sense of what is important. Roger Ailes ruled Fox channel for a long time. As soon as he was disgraced and ousted, he died within a year. Had he still been at Fox, he probably would have continued for another 10 years.\n\nPeople lose their bearings in life and therefore lose their stability. So he said, Dhritim Na Vindami Shamam Cha Vishno -- I do not see what I can do. I don't think I'm capable of anything, and I have no peace because of that. Danshtra Karalani Cha Te Mukhani -- now he gives the other side of the coin. Up till now, he was talking about all existence, seeing everything existing in you. I see that everything is existing in you and everything is supported by you. But now he says Danshtra Karalani Cha Te Mukhani Drashtva Eva Kala Anala Sannibhani -- I see in your mouth these terrible teeth, fearsome teeth, and fire blazing in your mouth. Disho Na Jane -- I don't see the directions. I do not see my place in life; I do not see my place in this universe. Up till now, I had a complete sense of who I am and where I am. In my family, there is a placement -- I know who I am. I know who I am in my community. I know who I am in my company. I know who I am as a citizen. There is a bearing I can describe. I'm at 1537B Knuckles Road. I can tell you how to come to me. There is a complete sense of placement and direction.\n\nI am such-and-such in the community. So I had a complete sense of my worth and my place in this universe. But once I see the mortality -- that everything is rushing towards you, and so am I -- that changes everything. Right now, I see my life in a static picture. I always see myself as existing now. It's a static picture in my head. Everybody else sees me getting old. It's very hard for you to imagine yourself to be growing and deteriorating. You have to constantly remind yourself, you know, I can't do that anymore. I have to keep telling myself, I'm an old man. Because I don't see myself as an old man. I have to remind myself.\n\nThe other day I was reading something. Some psychoanalyst says that the difference between a normal person and a psychopath is that a psychopath has to be reminded that certain behavior is not acceptable. A normal person naturally knows what is acceptable behavior in a society. A person suffering from that mental condition who becomes a sociopath or psychopath does not have that natural bearing. Somebody has to constantly tell him, \"This is not acceptable, this is not acceptable.\" Only then can he function in society. So Arjuna said, having seen this mortality -- that everything is rushing towards you, that there are terrible teeth and blazing fire in your mouth, that you are the resting place of everything, that all names and forms, including mine, will be destroyed in you -- therefore, I do not know what my place in life is.\n\nI am fast-forwarding my life right now. Normally, I see my life one frame at a time. Therefore, it is a static picture I am seeing. I see every moment as one frame at a time. I have forgotten the last frame, and I don't know the next frame. It's a static picture, and I consider that as my existence.\n\nBut fast-forward my life. We have DVR, obviously -- we record all the shows. Sometimes I say, \"Meena, you have 24 episodes of this Satyameva Jayate. When are we going to get rid of them?\" She says, \"Oh, no, no, I'll finish. I'll do speed watching.\" I had heard of speed reading, but speed watching! Fast-forward for three minutes and the whole show is done. A person's whole episode is over in two minutes. If our life is fast-forwarded, the eulogy at the end of your life tells the story. Somebody will give your entire life in two minutes: he was born in Surat, went to high school here, then went to architecture school, went to Africa, then taught Bhagavad Gita, and died. Entire life summarized in two minutes or less. When you fast-forward your life, the only thing you see is that you are rushing towards your death. That's all you're doing every moment. And we have to keep reminding ourselves -- we have birthday celebrations to say, \"This is not bad so far.\"\n\nSo he said, I do not know where I stand. Disho Na Jane Na Labhe Cha Sharma. Having seen my mortality and insignificance, I can't find any peace. What is the purpose of my life? We completely realize that all I consider to be my abilities are of no value when you are sick. And I have explained this before -- when you are sick, you can tell me anything about anything, but I'm not listening right now. I just can't feel good about anything. I have a fever of 105 and you want to talk to me about Bhagavad Gita? Forget about it right now. I can't find any bearing. And Arjuna said, I'm in that situation. I can't find it.\n\nSo he said, Prasida Devesha Jagannivasa -- be gracious to me, O Lord of the universe. This is, Swamiji says, the true surrender. Intellectually saying \"Bhagavan, tera tujhko arpan, kya lage mera\" -- intellectual surrender really means nothing, because you still think \"I am surrendering.\" That ego is still very much there. \"I am good, I am doing puja, I am doing meditation.\" That \"I\" is so solidly there that the surrender is of not much value.",
      "reflection": "Arjuna now sees the fearsome mouths with terrible jaws \"like glowing fires at the dissolution of creation\" and cries out: \"I lose all sense of place; I find no rest.\" Even more disturbing, he sees all the sons of Dhritarashtra, Bhishma, Drona, Karna, and warriors from both armies rushing headlong into these terrible mouths, \"some mangled between Thy jaws, with their heads crushed to atoms.\" The cosmic vision has revealed not just abstract unity but the concrete reality that everyone Arjuna knows is heading toward destruction.\n\nThis is the point where intellectual understanding becomes visceral. We all know that everyone dies, but Arjuna is seeing it happen - not as a future event but as a present reality from the cosmic perspective. The verse about losing \"all sense of place\" is particularly significant. Our sense of identity depends on knowing our place - in family, society, time. When we see that this placement is temporary and that we are all rushing toward the same dissolution, our ordinary bearings disappear. This is terrifying for the ego but liberating for the seeker who is ready.\n\nFor today's practice, try Swamiji's exercise of \"fast-forwarding\" your life. Imagine someone giving your eulogy - your entire life summarized in two minutes. What remains significant from this perspective? What falls away as trivial? Then extend this to everyone you will interact with today: each person you see is also moving toward their end. This is not meant to be morbid but to shift priorities. What conflicts would dissolve if you truly saw the temporary nature of all positions and identities? What kindness would become more natural? Let the awareness of universal mortality open compassion rather than despair."

      "commentary": "We have completed chapter 10, Vibhuti Yoga, and we'll now be discussing chapter 11, Vishwarupadarshan, the cosmic form of the Divine. In the last chapter, Arjuna had asked Krishna: tell me how I should feel your presence, the presence of the divine, the presence of that all-pervading self, and how I can meditate upon that. In response, Bhagavan gave him various examples of excellence in this world from various walks of life -- applicable to Arjuna and also to us -- showing that from our day-to-day life, from our cultural backgrounds, from our spiritual quest, we find examples all around us of excellence and can feel the Lord's presence. As we discussed in chapter 10, anytime I see excellence, my mind recognizes it as God's blessings, the grace of God. In other words, divinity is evident in excellence. Bhagavan gave various examples for Arjuna and said, when you see this, it will remind you of my presence in all things and beings. I'm not limited to those excellent manifestations, but that's where you will find it easier to experience my presence.\n\nAnd now that Arjuna has heard that, he says: I'm still not experiencing that oneness, the oneness which you talk about throughout this discourse. I have intellectually appreciated it and come to the conclusion that that's what it is -- that there is one singular entity pervading this entire universe, which is you, the Supreme Self. But I need to have that experience. I would like to experience that oneness. This, as Swamiji explains, is similar to how we scientifically make any concept or theory our own knowledge. First I need to gather all the evidence and data.\n\nAnd then, once I have gathered all the data and evidence, I need to demonstrate that the phenomenon exists. I gather all information about how water is formed. In chemistry class, two molecules of hydrogen and one molecule of oxygen can create water. But at some point, I want to see the demonstration -- in the lab, I create that situation and then see how hydrogen and oxygen create water. In a similar fashion, Arjuna has now understood, but he wants to see a demonstration. So the chapter starts with Arjuna Vacha.\n\nArjuna said: Mat Anugraha Ya Paramam Guhyam Adhyatma Sangnitam Yat Tvaya Uktam Vachasthena Moho Ayam Vigato Mama. With your compassion for me, you have given me this secret knowledge. And as you have said, the self is indestructible, imperishable. One who considers himself to be the slayer or the slain -- in both cases, he is wrong. There is nothing to grieve over in the changes which take place in this world, including death, because death is not the end of existence. It is only the end of existence in the form of this body.\n\nSo Moho Ayam Vigato Mama -- by this discourse of yours, you have given me the secret knowledge. Bhavapyayo Hi Bhutanam Shrutao Vistaraso Maya Tvattah Kamala Patraksha Mahatmyam Api Cha Avyayam -- I have also heard the origin and destruction of beings, O lotus-eyed Krishna, from you, and also your inexhaustible greatness. I heard the greatness of the self, the supreme Brahman, that which is not limited by anything.\n\nAnd therefore my delusion is gone. I understand it clearly now. Evam Etat Yatha Attha Tvam Atmanam Parameshwara Drashtum Icchami Te Rupam Aishwaram Purushottamam. However, I would like to see that form as you described yourself -- that oneness in this world of plurality. I have understood that you pervade the entire universe and therefore there is no existence separate from you.\n\nHowever, at this time I cannot see that, and I would like to see that. I would like to experience that oneness of yours. Manyase Yadi Tat Shakyam Maya Drashtum Iti Prabho -- if you think it is possible for me to see that divine form, then, O Lord of Yogas, show me that imperishable form which includes everything in this world. I would like to see that complete form of yours where everything is in yourself.\n\nIt is easier for me to see your presence in this world of plurality. As Swamiji explains, it is easier for me to see gold in gold jewelry. I can take one look at it, experience the gold in it, then pick up another piece. As long as the excellence is there, in other words, the gold is apparent and not covered by something -- the gold is manifested in the jewelry -- I can see the gold in it. So it is easier to see the divinity in the world of plurality for us. What is not possible for us generally is seeing all the plurality in that one single entity. I can imagine that God is in you. God is in me, God is in He, God is in she. If my mind and intellect has achieved that level of purity, level of understanding, then I start seeing the divinity in all beings.\n\nAnd therefore, in our culture, when we meet each other, we say, namaste, Namah te, I bow down to you. I'm not bowing down to the limited self which is standing in front of me. Because I may have my own opinion about that person, but I still do. Namaste to all of the people I meet, at least culturally. That's what we should be doing or we are doing. Who we are bowing down to is the divinity in that person that I recognize.\n\nThe divinity in me and divinity in you is the same. So I respect the divinity in you. I bow down to you with that recognition. My transaction with you would be always of very friendly, very congenial, and not adversarial. Because I have recognized that myself and yourself has one thing in common, that consciousness, the divinity which makes me who I am. The same divinity, the same consciousness is within you.\n\nWhat I have trouble imagining or perceiving or seeing is that the whole divinity is one, and you and I are in it. And we have heard in Bhagavad Gita before, Bhagavan says, I am not in them, they are in me. The car is in the space, the space is not in the car. When I see a car which was built in Germany, there was space inside. When it was in Germany, there was German space.\n\nAnd they seal it tight and then transport that car to United States. Now the car is here, the space is still intact which was sealed in Germany. Now, whether the space now in the United States is the German space or American space in the car, obviously the answer is simple. The space inside the car is American space. So what happened to the German space which was in the car when it was still tight in Germany? The answer obviously is in our way of seeing space.\n\nAs long as I see the space in the car, I have difficulty imagining what happening to that space which was German space. When it came to America, the space was inside the car. Car was never opened till it came here. Well, it should have been a German space in it. But if I start seeing that the space was not in the car, the car was in the space, then I do not have any difficulty. Car was traveling in the space.\n\nAnd therefore wherever the car is, that country space is in that car, because car is traveling in the space. For me to imagine that, I have to first have a perception of a space as a totality without any gap. A German space is one space, an American space is another space, I will have difficulty. But if I can imagine a homogeneous, continuous, universal space, now I can see everything is in it. So what you and I have difficulty in recognizing the unity between myself and yourself and herself, and also the objects in this room is because of the distance between us. I am here and you are there, you are there and she is somewhere else.\n\nWhat is separating us from each other is the space. What is separating me from my father is the time. My father lived up to 1975 and I'm here today in 2014 thinking about it. So we are separated from each other by time. So there are two things which creates this world of plurality for me, and that is space and time. We have also heard from sages and scientists that this concept of space and this concept of time is creation of my mind.\n\nSo one can say, well, what is the distance between here to D.C. and so on. So it's too long a journey. And somebody will say it's too close, it's only two hour drive. So my mind creates the valuation whether it's too far or too little, that the conception of space in my mind, same thing. If somebody says I'll be back in half an hour, well, is it too soon for me or too long for me? I can't wait for half an hour.\n\nYou need to be back here in 10 minutes. Because my conception of time is different than his conception of time. For him half an hour is too short, and for me half an hour is too long. Well, anytime somebody goes to India for a vacation and when they come back, and if I ask that person, so how was your vacation? The answer is it was great, but it was too short. And I say, how long were you there?\n\nHe said four weeks for me, too long a time. I only go there for a week or two. So for me a two weeks vacation is good enough for them four weeks is too short, because when you are enjoying their four weeks seems too short. But if you were suffering because of the heat or monsoon and all the other things which we normally complain about, if I'm suffering. I'll say, boy, it was too long when I tried. And then I finally was ready to get out.\n\nSo even time is a concept of my mind. If these two concepts of my mind are wiped out, then I will see the world completely differently. If the concept of space is wiped out from my mind, then I will see you and I and everyone in this room come together as one entity. There is no space between us. We are all joined together and we will be one entity with different limbs, but we are all together. Swamiji uses a very good analogy in his commentary.\n\nThere is a toy maker making toys from clay. And he has various toys and various dolls. Elephant, tiger, baby and a bird. And then he decided, no, this is not good. I need to use this clay for something much larger, more sellable. He takes all those dolls and compresses them into one ball of clay.\n\nAnd when he compressed them together, what he has done is taken all the space away from each other. Previously they were sitting on a table or in a display box as separate entity. Once he gathers them and lumps them into one. And now a big lump of clay. At the same time, I can see the face of the elephant on that surface of that lump. Also see the baby smile.\n\nAlso see the tiger's face. What is taken away from each other is the space. The same way the events in my life has a time value of it was in my past, or it is in my present, or it will be in my future. My childhood is in my past. My youth is in my past. My old age is in my present.",
      "reflection": "Arjuna uses two powerful metaphors to describe what he sees: rivers flooding furiously into the ocean, and moths flying impetuously into flame \"only to be killed.\" Both images share a common quality - the movement is irresistible and ends in dissolution of individual identity. The river does not choose to merge with the ocean; the moth does not choose to enter the flame. This is the inherent nature of manifestation returning to its source. Then Arjuna sees the Lord \"swallowing up the worlds, lapping them in flame\" with glory filling the universe.\n\nThe river metaphor is particularly instructive. A mighty river like the Ganges has its own identity, its own name, its own course through the landscape. People build cities on its banks, write poems about it, worship it. Yet eventually, inevitably, it disappears into the ocean and loses all separate identity. From the ocean's perspective, there is no Ganges - only water that briefly took a particular form and path. This is true of every individual life, every civilization, every world.\n\nToday, contemplate your life as a river. Where did \"you\" really begin? In your birth? Your parents' meeting? The formation of Earth? Trace the current of your existence backward and find no true beginning. Now follow it forward - where does \"you\" end? In death? In the memories others hold? In the effects of your actions rippling outward? See how the boundaries of your identity are not as fixed as they appear. The practice is not to become nihilistic but to recognize that you are already part of the ocean taking the temporary form of a river. Living from this recognition brings both humility and freedom."

      "commentary": "What is my purpose and destiny? We had been discussing chapter 11. We have seen Arjuna's description of what he is seeing, and we have discussed so many times in the last few weeks. What he has seen is everything that he can perceive in this world, all coming together as one, this plurality which is separated from each other. Now he sees that as one singularity. He also sees all the divine beings which he has just heard of in his Vedic training or from the cultural training.\n\nHe sees all of them -- Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh -- all of them merged into this one entity. But he also sees that all these beings are rushing towards the mouth of that supreme being and getting dissolved, disappearing into it. And he comes to this realization that just as the river water is rushing towards the ocean -- intuitively, with inherent nature, not that somebody is propelling it or forcing it, but by its inherent nature. The river water runs from the mountaintops through the plains to the ocean. Just as the moth instinctively rush towards its death into the flame, river rushes towards the ocean, loses its identity. Mighty river, like Ganges or Yamuna or even Patomak or James, once it disappears into the ocean, there is no identity of the river of its own.\n\nIt just becomes part of the ocean. It seems that is the true nature of the river and the moth. So he sees that all the beings are without any hesitation, they're rushing towards the mouth of this great being and disappearing into it. And then he sees that this great being is seemingly enjoying this act of all these beings disappearing into his mouth, some get stuck. He makes sure that nobody is left out when we do some task. And we are so happy about it, that we are so proud of that.\n\nIn the end we try to inspect and say, is there anything left? That's basically equivalent to licking up what's going into his mouth -- making sure that all these beings are getting dissolved into his own being.\n\nAnd now Arjuna says, I don't understand any of this. Akyahi me ko bhavan ugrarupaha -- tell me, O being with a very fierce form. Namostu te deva or prasida -- if you want to ask somebody who you are and that person is not smaller than you, you better be a little respectful first.\n\nHe does ask and say, I want to know who you are. But first, Namostute devara prasida -- you are the supreme Lord, so I bow down to you, have mercy on me, because I don't understand. I am not capable of understanding who you are. And vignatum ichami bhavantam adyam -- I have completely and clearly recognized that you are the Adi being. You are the original being. All beings are nothing but the manifestation of you.\n\nThey come from you, they go into you. But you are that original Bhavantam adyam. You are that original being. Vignatum ichami -- I want to know, which in normal terms we say, I want to know God. I know he is the supreme being.\n\nAt least from my childhood religious training I understood that he controlled this world. Vigna tam ichami bhavanta madhyam -- even after having this global vision, the cosmic vision, our intellect is not capable of understanding it. Nahi prajanami tavapravratyam -- also, I have no idea why you are doing this activity which I see right now. Isn't that something we ask all the time? I don't know why Bhagawan does this thing, why there is a tsunami, why there is an earthquake, or why Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are successful and not every IT person in this country. I do not know what you are doing, Bhagwan.\n\nI hope you know what you are doing. Basically Arjuna puts it in his word very respectfully saying I want to know you O supreme Being. I clearly recognize you are the original being, but I also don't understand what you are engaged in right now. I see all these beings going into your mouth and getting crushed. He has also seen -- we have seen -- that all Kauravas are going into his mouth, as well as all the great kings on both sides.\n\nSee, anytime we have a vision, we focus on something closer to our own situation. Anytime you have a dream, the dream is always something related to what you were thinking about in the last week or so.\n\nSo even when he sees this whole cosmic vision, he focuses on the Kauravas going into his mouth. All the kings from the Kauravas as well as the kings from our side, going into his mouth. He says, I don't understand what you are engaged in right now.\n\nAnd in response to that, Bhagavan says, Kalo'smi -- I am time. Lokaksha Kruta Pravrad daha -- I am engaged in destroying this world. I can see the world from both perspectives.\n\nEither I can see it from a constructive perspective or a destructive perspective in nature. Actually both simultaneously keeps going on. Something gets destroyed, something gets built. I can fix my perspective only on the destruction part and say why this thing is happening. I can look at the statistics in the newspaper and say how many people die every day and say oh God, billions of people die. I don't know whether millions or billions, but I'm sure there are plenty because every several seconds there's somebody dies in the United States.\n\nI read somewhere about how many people die every day, and if I look at that and say God, why do you do this? This many people dying every day. Don't you have better things to do than just killing? Right now Arjuna is just seeing this destruction going on. So Bhagavan's answer is also exactly that. Kalaha Asmi, I am all devouring time.\n\nI was born in 1948. In 2012, I'm an old man, but sometime in the 2000-somethings I won't be around. That's what Lokakshaya krita pravadha means. You're seeing me destroying this world. As you know, the world as I know right now, is actually rushing towards its own destruction. All my friends and relatives and all of them, one after the other, they're all rushing towards their own death.\n\nKalavasmi lokaksha Kruta Prabhradha. From your perspective, Arjuna, I am that all devouring time. Right now what you are seeing is I am engaged in destroying these worlds. Lokan sama hartum iha pravrutaha ruteapi tvamna Bhavishyanti swarve e avasthitaha pratyanikeshi odaha. Even without you -- now coming down very personally to Arjuna -- Arjuna had said, I don't want to engage in this war. The whole purpose of this divine vision Arjuna wanted to have was connected to all the philosophy Bhagavan gave him in the second chapter about why he should engage in this war. Bhagavan had said, look, whoever takes birth will die.\n\nBeginning they unmanifest, they will manifest for a while, they will unmanifest in the end. So you don't worry about it. Whatever the little role you are given in this drama, you take part and take credit for it and you don't worry about who's going to die and who's going to survive. But Arjuna was not clear. So he said, well let me see this entire vision now. He sees the entire vision and then he says I don't understand what are you doing?\n\nAnd Bhagawan basically said, don't worry about it, I am time. I'm going to destroy everything in time. Whether you take part in it or not. Even without you, none of the warriors in front of you shall live. Whether you take part in this war or not is immaterial. Their destiny is to die in time.\n\nWhenever their time will come, they will die. Because I am that all devouring time. Tasmat Utestha Yashola Basva -- all you have to do is take credit for it. Everybody says Bill Clinton was the best president in his time. We all thrived and our country has this surplus we never had seen in all these times before. And George Bush came and completely messed it all up.\n\nBut I'll tell you what, if George Bush was the president at the time when the technology bubble was blowing up, he would have the same credit. He just happened to be at that time a president. And we can blame Obama all we want. About 8% or 9% unemployment. But even if Bill Clinton is today, he would have the same problem. Because this thing is driven by this cycle, cosmic cycle, economic cycles, whatever the cycle you want to call it, you just happen to be there.\n\nAnd if you're a smart person, you do your part and take credit. Become that instrument in this giant will of Dharma. So therefore Bhagavan said, look, all these people are already killed by me. Without your help also they will get killed. You just saw that every being is rushing towards their death in my mouth. Get up Yashola Basra and get the fame that you deserve.\n\nJitva Satrun Bhangshvarajam Samruddham -- get victory over your enemies and enjoy the kingdom. Maya Evey Thai Nihitaha Purva Meva -- I have already killed all these people before you decided to start this war. Nimittamatram Bhava Savya Sachin -- so you just become the Nimitta Matra.\n\nIf somebody gives you credit and says, why don't you become our group's leader and do this petition to such and such?\n\nIt's not that the guy who is making a petition is the only guy who came up with the idea or we are just giving him a credit. Look we can all go and talk. You become our leader. Arjuna, I'm just giving you this opportunity. To become the Nimitt Matra because you deserve it. We always choose a person who has the best capabilities or the best qualification to become the representative of our group.\n\nWe try to elect the best person who could be our president by looking at his qualifications. So becoming a Nimitta Matra is also something to be very proud of. That somebody has given us a chance considering us to be worthy of it. So when Bhagavan said, you become Nimitta Matra for something, you should take great pride in it and get up and do it. Swamiji says, in this case it is Arjuna. But in our case also, we get this chance all the time.\n\nBhagavan gives us the ability, capability, and opportunity to do something at our level in this world. And Bhagavan saying the same thing, look, I have already done this thing. It will be done whether you take part in it or not. But you have this opportunity. Why don't you take this chance and become Nimitta Matra? Become the instrument in my hand and take the credit and enjoy the credit.\n\nBhagavan said to Arjuna, same thing. These people are killed. You just do your part. You had been trained for these wars, stand up for the right cause. Take your credit and enjoy the fruits. Dronam Chabism Cha Jayadratham cha Karnam Tatha Anyanabi Yodavira Maya Hatam Stumhi Jahimam Vyatista.\n\nNobody gives us this kind of guarantee before we start anything. \"Neil, go and do this. You are going to win it. Don't worry about it. I already took care of it.\" Once in a while somebody does it for us too.\n\nOur father comes and says, \"Beta, don't worry about it. I already talked to him. They are going to hire you,\" right? So Bhagavan said, look, you are worried about a few of them. Whether you admit it or not, you think, how can I fight in front of these great warriors such as Drona, Bhishma, Jayadratha, and Karna?\n\nBhagavan specifically mentions them and says I have already killed them.",
      "reflection": "These verses contain one of the most famous declarations in the Gita: \"Kalo'smi\" - I am Time. When Arjuna asks who this terrible being is and what his intention is, Krishna reveals himself as \"the Destroyer who lays waste the world.\" Then comes the practical instruction: \"Gird up thy loins and conquer... I have already doomed them. Be thou my instrument (nimitta matra).\" The warriors will die whether Arjuna fights or not; his participation does not determine the outcome but gives him the opportunity to fulfill his dharma.\n\nThe concept of \"nimitta matra\" - being merely an instrument - is revolutionary. We typically think our actions determine outcomes. But Krishna suggests that from the cosmic perspective, outcomes are already determined by the flow of time and karma. Our role is not to determine results but to participate fully and righteously in the unfolding. This is not fatalism but freedom from the anxiety of results. A surgeon operates with full skill; the outcome depends on many factors beyond her control. Her job is excellent action, not guaranteed results.\n\nFor today's practice, approach one significant task with the attitude of \"nimitta matra.\" Do your absolute best while inwardly acknowledging that you are an instrument, not the ultimate doer. Notice how this shifts your relationship to anxiety and pressure. Ask yourself: In what areas of life am I exhausting myself trying to control what time will ultimately determine anyway? Where can I be a more willing instrument, doing excellent work while leaving results to the larger flow?"

      "commentary": "What is my purpose and destiny? We had been discussing chapter 11. We have seen Arjuna's description of what he is seeing, and we have discussed so many times in the last few weeks. What he has seen is everything that he can perceive in this world, all coming together as one, this plurality which is separated from each other. Now he sees that as one singularity. He also sees all the divine beings which he has just heard of in his Vedic training or from the cultural training.\n\nHe sees all of them -- Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh -- all of them merged into this one entity. But he also sees that all these beings are rushing towards the mouth of that supreme being and getting dissolved, disappearing into it. And he comes to this realization that just as the river water is rushing towards the ocean -- intuitively, with inherent nature, not that somebody is propelling it or forcing it, but by its inherent nature. The river water runs from the mountaintops through the plains to the ocean. Just as the moth instinctively rush towards its death into the flame, river rushes towards the ocean, loses its identity. Mighty river, like Ganges or Yamuna or even Patomak or James, once it disappears into the ocean, there is no identity of the river of its own.\n\nIt just becomes part of the ocean. It seems that is the true nature of the river and the moth. So he sees that all the beings are without any hesitation, they're rushing towards the mouth of this great being and disappearing into it. And then he sees that this great being is seemingly enjoying this act of all these beings disappearing into his mouth, some get stuck. He makes sure that nobody is left out when we do some task. And we are so happy about it, that we are so proud of that.\n\nIn the end we try to inspect and say, is there anything left? That's basically equivalent to licking up what's going into his mouth -- making sure that all these beings are getting dissolved into his own being.\n\nAnd now Arjuna says, I don't understand any of this. Akyahi me ko bhavan ugrarupaha -- tell me, O being with a very fierce form. Namostu te deva or prasida -- if you want to ask somebody who you are and that person is not smaller than you, you better be a little respectful first.\n\nHe does ask and say, I want to know who you are. But first, Namostute devara prasida -- you are the supreme Lord, so I bow down to you, have mercy on me, because I don't understand. I am not capable of understanding who you are. And vignatum ichami bhavantam adyam -- I have completely and clearly recognized that you are the Adi being. You are the original being. All beings are nothing but the manifestation of you.\n\nThey come from you, they go into you. But you are that original Bhavantam adyam. You are that original being. Vignatum ichami -- I want to know, which in normal terms we say, I want to know God. I know he is the supreme being.\n\nAt least from my childhood religious training I understood that he controlled this world. Vigna tam ichami bhavanta madhyam -- even after having this global vision, the cosmic vision, our intellect is not capable of understanding it. Nahi prajanami tavapravratyam -- also, I have no idea why you are doing this activity which I see right now. Isn't that something we ask all the time? I don't know why Bhagawan does this thing, why there is a tsunami, why there is an earthquake, or why Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are successful and not every IT person in this country. I do not know what you are doing, Bhagwan.\n\nI hope you know what you are doing. Basically Arjuna puts it in his word very respectfully saying I want to know you O supreme Being. I clearly recognize you are the original being, but I also don't understand what you are engaged in right now. I see all these beings going into your mouth and getting crushed. He has also seen -- we have seen -- that all Kauravas are going into his mouth, as well as all the great kings on both sides.\n\nSee, anytime we have a vision, we focus on something closer to our own situation. Anytime you have a dream, the dream is always something related to what you were thinking about in the last week or so.\n\nSo even when he sees this whole cosmic vision, he focuses on the Kauravas going into his mouth. All the kings from the Kauravas as well as the kings from our side, going into his mouth. He says, I don't understand what you are engaged in right now.\n\nAnd in response to that, Bhagavan says, Kalo'smi -- I am time. Lokaksha Kruta Pravrad daha -- I am engaged in destroying this world. I can see the world from both perspectives.\n\nEither I can see it from a constructive perspective or a destructive perspective in nature. Actually both simultaneously keeps going on. Something gets destroyed, something gets built. I can fix my perspective only on the destruction part and say why this thing is happening. I can look at the statistics in the newspaper and say how many people die every day and say oh God, billions of people die. I don't know whether millions or billions, but I'm sure there are plenty because every several seconds there's somebody dies in the United States.\n\nI read somewhere about how many people die every day, and if I look at that and say God, why do you do this? This many people dying every day. Don't you have better things to do than just killing? Right now Arjuna is just seeing this destruction going on. So Bhagavan's answer is also exactly that.

You're seeing me destroying this world. As you know, the world as I know right now, is actually rushing towards its own destruction. All my friends and relatives and all of them, one after the other, they're all rushing towards their own death.\n\nKalavasmi lokaksha Kruta Prabhradha.

      "reflection": "Having heard Krishna declare \"I am Time\" and \"I have already killed them,\" Arjuna responds with trembling, prostration, and choked voice. Sanjaya notes he was \"overwhelmed with awe, bowing down again and again.\" Then Arjuna speaks: \"It is natural that the world revels and rejoices when it sings the praises of Thy glory; the demons fly in fear and the saints offer Thee their salutations.\" He is processing the vision intellectually while still emotionally shaken.\n\nNotice the different responses to the divine revelation: demons flee in fear, saints offer salutations, and the world rejoices in singing praises. How we respond to truth depends on our nature and readiness. The same reality that terrifies the unprepared becomes a source of devotion for the mature seeker. Arjuna stands at the threshold - shaken but not fleeing, overwhelmed but still present and engaged. This is the response of a genuine seeker: neither running away nor pretending everything is fine.\n\nReflect today on how you respond to difficult truths. When you encounter the reality of impermanence, do you flee into distraction? When you see the suffering in the world, do you turn away or remain present? The spiritual path is not about achieving a state where nothing disturbs you but about developing the capacity to remain present with whatever arises. Practice today by staying with one uncomfortable truth for just a few minutes longer than you normally would. Notice the impulse to flee and gently remain. This builds the capacity that allows transformation."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 11, Viswarupadarshan Yoga of the Cosmic form of the Lord. We have seen so far that Arjuna learned from Bhagavan first the nature of the limited self. What is the nature of this conditioned self? He learned that the self is immortal. The conditionings are perishable. The conditionings -- this body, this mind, this intellect -- are perishable.\n\nBut the self is imperishable. And therefore, while working in this world, keep that self in mind, identify with that self. But that is not very naturally happening to people. So Bhagavan talked about how to act in this world, addressed Arjuna, that you should act in this world in the spirit of Yajna. You will be then gradually detach yourself from this ego and will be able to identify with yourself. So then obviously Arjuna wanted to know the nature of that imperishable self.\n\nSo from chapter seven, Bhagavan said, I am the source of all the beings and things. Aham krutnasya jagadah prabhavaha pralayah t -- I am the source and dissolution of all things and beings in this world. So that's my relationship to you: I am the source of all the beings, and therefore also the source of you. And then he says, matthaha parataram na asti kincit anyat asti dhananjaya -- there is nothing higher than me.\n\nThere is nothing higher than this self. Therefore you should identify with the self. But Arjuna obviously was not ready to take this on its face value. The Bhagavan said, I am the source of all the beings and all the things. He wanted to know more. So he said, I want to know in detail your glories.\n\nBecause he is still identifying with Krishna as Krishna, and himself as Arjuna. How can Krishna be the Lord of all the beings? Arjuna, identifying with his limited self, is speaking from his ego's perspective and projecting his world. Krishna is speaking from his identification with the Supreme. He said, I am the source of all the beings. So Arjuna said, explain to me in detail, because I actually love hearing about your great glories, all the powers of this omnipresent, omniscient being.\n\nSo in chapter 10 we have a detailed description of Bhagavan saying that you can see my glory in everything that is splendid, wonderful, strong -- anything where you can find something which catches your eye.\n\nThat's me at the core of all beings. I am the sweetness in sugar, I am the light in sun, I am the liquidity in water. And even he says Dyutam, Chalaya, Tamasmi, even I am the gambling and the fraudulence. Even that also somebody can only cheat you if he is alive and conscious and consciousness is working through him. Everything that you see in this world, the core of all beings and things, is me and me alone. Nothing other than me exists.\n\nArjuna heard all that, but he's still not satisfied. He's still not grasping the whole idea of the omniscience and omnipotence of the Lord -- how the Lord can be everywhere. So he says, I want to see it. I have no doubt; you said this and also many others have said so before you. So I have no doubt about it. I take it for granted that what you are saying is correct.\n\nBecause time and again, sages after sages from generations have come and confirmed that this is the truth. So I am not doubting it now. You, Krishna, telling me so, I have no doubt -- but I want to see it. And therefore in chapter 11 we see that Krishna grants him this great vision of totality, where Arjuna can see all at once -- the past, present and future, an entire universe in one glimpse. And what he sees is that up till now the things which he has been seeing as different entities are all merged into one.\n\nThey're all part of the one entity. Therefore he describes and says, I'm seeing that you have thousands of mouths and thousands of hands and thousands of legs and thousands of stomachs. Because every stomach is yours, every hand is yours, every mouth is yours. So I see now all of them as part of the one entity. I'm seeing wonderful sights -- all these forms and colors and all the deities, things which I have not seen before, I have not even imagined before. I'm seeing all of them.\n\nSo he's enchanted by that form. But then he sees the other side of it. Other side of creation is always destruction. This is the other side of it. He sees that now all those beings which I see existing in him also rushing towards his mouth to get destroyed. Every name and form in this world is helplessly rushing toward its own destruction within the self which is supporting it.\n\nSo he starts getting really nervous about it that everyone is rushing towards your mouth to get destroyed. And I see the great people, the great heroes are helplessly rushing towards your mouth and getting destroyed. And that vision really terrified him. We had this notion about Bhagavan as one who is compassionate, serene, and creative. But the destructive aspect -- we never focus on that. Arjuna, while listening to all the discourses before, all the glories, all the splendid descriptions given --\n\nI am the light in the sun. I am the fragrance in flower. So he was expecting it will be all well and good. Once I see the totality, it will be wonderful. My mind will be at peace. And after that there will be no problem.\n\nBut he sees the other side of it. He says everything is getting destroyed. Every name and form is getting destroyed in the being of that great Mahatma, the great person, the Purusha, the one entity. So he says, I'm terrified. I can't find my place in life. I don't know where I am and I'm losing my bearing.\n\nSo tell me, who are you and what are you up to? Because I have never imagined your form like this. See, only in our culture, in our religion, we have terrible forms of God also -- Kali and Shiva doing Tandava and Rudra and Pralaya. But in most cases we want to see him as a very calm, serene, and peaceful God. But when you want to understand God in totality, Bhagavan says, you have to know this also.\n\nSo he sees this destruction happening. Bhagavan says, I am the world-devouring time. Kalo'smi -- I am that time which devours everything. Within time, all names and forms will be destroyed. Everything dissolves into time. Things exist in time, get destroyed by time.\n\nI am that all-devouring time. What you are seeing right now is my form which devours all names and forms. What are you up to right now? I'm engaged in destroying the world as you know it. The world as you and I know it is already getting destroyed by Bhagavan. Every second, every millisecond, it's constantly getting destroyed.\n\nMy reality yesterday is no longer my reality today. My reality today will no longer be my reality tomorrow. So it's constant, constantly destroying my world. And I am on the other end, constantly trying to keep my world in a status quo. I want to keep it exactly as I like. I think I'm right now in a better situation.\n\nLet's keep it that way. So we have a tug of war between Bhagavan and me. I try to keep it; he wants to destroy it. So when I see his all-destroying power, I ask, why are you doing this? He says, my purpose is clear: I am the time who devours everything.\n\nAnd right now you are seeing me destroying the world. As you know, and directly addressing. Arjuna said you were afraid that you will kill all these people. You thought that you are so powerful that you will kill all these people. Therefore you were afraid of taking part in this war. He said, I have already killed them all.\n\nFrom our perspective, we are all alive and trying to survive. But Bhagavan says, there's time. I have already killed all of you -- for whatever time it is, you are going to be killed by time. No matter how many cryogenic clinics open in Richmond -- there is one opened, I guess, recently.\n\nThe time may be in years, maybe in millennia. But you will be destroyed by time. I've already destroyed you as the name and form you exist. I already killed you. Whether you take part in this game or not. You think that you don't want to take part in destroying these people?\n\nThese people are already destroyed, because as we learned, what will get destroyed is the conditioning. Only the self is immaculate, permanent, without any limitations. So these people are already destroyed as they exist -- whether they are Karna, Bhishma, or Jayadratha. Even though they seem invincible from your perspective, and they have powers so much greater than yours.\n\nBut they are killed by me. So my advice to you, Arjuna, is take charge of your life. Do what you were trained to do. Do what you thought was the purpose of your life. To establish the rule of justice and punish the people who are evil doers. I have already killed them.\n\nYou take the credit and then enjoy this kingdom. And that's where Bhagavan stopped. Then Sanjaya now takes a chance to tell Dhritarashtra what's happening. Sanjaya Vacha -- etatshrutva vachanam Kesavasya Krutanjalir vaipamanaha Kiriti namaskritva Bhuya evaha Krishnam Sagadgadam Bhitebhitaha Pranamya. He's giving a running commentary. He says, having heard these words from Krishna --\n\nThat I already killed all of them. I am the one who devours everything. I am the one who kills. You just take the credit and enjoy the victory. Only you can take credit or enjoy victory if you take part in it. If I don't take part, there is no chance.\n\nThere is 100% chance of me losing if I don't buy a lottery ticket. Guaranteed 100% chance of not winning the lottery. That's at least the surest outcome I can say. But if I think I have a chance to win 1 in 10 million, I have to buy a lottery ticket. I have to take part in it. So Bhagavan said, I already decided who the winner is.\n\nYou go ahead and buy a lottery ticket if you think you can. But if you don't take part, you will have no chance to win this thing. So Arjuna, therefore get up and do your duty. Result is decided by me. But you have a duty to perform your actions, for which you are trained, which you thought is the purpose of your life. And you must pursue that.\n\nHaving heard this, Sanjaya said that this Kiriti, the crowned one, Krutanjali Vepamanha -- his folded palms trembling, because he is still shaken up by this vision of all death and destruction happening constantly in this great self. The self remaining what it is, the names and forms are created in it and getting destroyed all the time. Namaskritva -- having prostrated to him -- Bhuya Eva Aha Krishnam -- he said the following words. He is choked with emotions, choked with the realization of what the self is all about. Up till now, I was in control of my life.\n\nI thought I can control it. I have accomplished things. I have acquired abilities and promises. I suddenly realized that those things are of no value unless there is a support from the Almighty. The consciousness functioning through me. I may be the best architect, but if I'm in a coma, it doesn't do any good to anybody.",
      "reflection": "Arjuna now offers a prayer of deep recognition: Krishna is \"greater than the Powers of creation, the First Cause, Infinite, the Lord of Lords.\" He declares Krishna to be \"the Primal God, the Ancient, the Knower, the Knowledge and the Final Home... the Wind, Death, Fire, Water, the Moon, the Father and the Grandfather.\" This comprehensive list shows Arjuna seeing Krishna not as one god among many but as the source and essence of all divine principles and natural forces.\n\nThe teaching here is about the relationship between the many and the One. We worship different aspects of divinity - some pray to a nurturing mother aspect, others to a powerful protector, still others to wisdom or prosperity. Arjuna's vision reveals that all these are expressions of one reality. Wind, Death, Fire, Water - seemingly separate forces - are all manifestations of the same supreme consciousness. This does not diminish the deities but reveals their ultimate unity.\n\nFor today's practice, notice the divine in multiple forms throughout your day. See consciousness in the sustaining power of your breath (Vayu), in the natural limits and endings you encounter (Yama), in the transformative fire of your digestion and passion (Agni), in the flowing adaptability of water. Instead of thinking \"this is different from that,\" practice seeing each as a face of the same underlying reality. When you say \"namaste\" to someone, recognize you are bowing to the same consciousness that looks out through your own eyes. This practice of seeing unity in diversity is the practical application of Arjuna's vision."

      "commentary": "As we have been discussing last few times, that now that Arjuna has seen this cosmic form of the Lord, in other words, his mind has comprehended the unity of this plurality, this world which seemingly is divided among this plurality of things and beings, is actually strung by the same entity which manifests as this plurality, beings and things come out of the same reality and dissolve into the same reality. That reality is what he's facing right now. So he's now offering his prayer, his adoration to that. And he has said, you are everything -- Vayu, Yama, Agni, Varuna. Anything that I can think of, any being my mind can perceive, is nothing but you alone; all I see is you. And therefore he says, my salutations to you, my salutations to you a thousand times. I salute you from your front, I salute you in your back, I salute you at your side, because you are everywhere. Wherever I turn around, I see you.\n\nIf we come to the conclusion that this world is nothing but the Lord's manifestation, then obviously when we turn around, we see him. Just like this classical story -- maybe it's folklore -- that Nanak went to Kaaba and was sleeping with his feet towards Kaaba. The Maulvi comes and says, you idiot, what are you doing? He said, oh, is that what I'm doing? Well, then move my leg to where the Kaaba is not. The Maulvi in anger moves his leg. Wherever he turns it, he sees Kaaba moving around with it.\n\nSo basically saying God is everywhere, because God is everything, therefore God is everywhere. So he said, therefore. Now, whatever I see when I say I bow down in the front, in the back and the rear, whatever I see in front of me, whatever I see in the side of me is nothing. But you and I recognize that in our culture we say namaste -- Namah te -- I bow down to you. Not you as a person, but you the self, which is no other than myself. Once we find that commonality, we obviously can't have animosity or jealousy. But we just give lip service. Namaste -- we never understood.\n\nSo obviously we don't get the benefit of that. But if we develop any commonality with anybody -- somebody says, \"Sunil, which university did you go to?\" \"Oh, I'm also from Baroda.\" Then we start feeling comfortable right there. Then he says, \"Which year were you?\" The more we find we have in common, the more we like each other, the more we fall in love with each other.\n\nIn other words, we find more identification with that person. So here now he is finding that everything that he knows is now him. So he is offering his salutation. Then he suddenly realizes that maybe when he was not aware of this fact, he may have insulted people. He may have insulted people who he should actually be respecting. In this case, obviously, he superimposes all of that onto Krishna, because Krishna is the one who showed him this Vishwaroop.\n\nSo he identifies what he is seeing as Krishna's self. I, Arjuna, am seeing Krishna's self as this great cosmic being who is everywhere and everything. Therefore, Hare Ram Hare Krishna -- which is Swami Prabhupada's movement -- they call it Krishna consciousness. The lineage from Shankaracharya speaks of consciousness, self-consciousness. Myself and yourself is one and the same. Prabhupada comes from a different lineage, which is a dualistic school of thought. They look at the Bhagavad Gita the same way except with a slightly different twist: they will say, let my consciousness right now -- ego consciousness -- identify with the Krishna consciousness.\n\nThen I become one with Krishna, the Krishna, not that historical Krishna but the universal being. So here Arjuna sees the same way as this is the Krishna's great cosmic form. I have known Krishna from my childhood as Devaki's son, Yashoda's son, my cousin -- but look at his greatness. Sakha Ithimatva Prasabham Yad Uktam -- not knowing your greatness, I may have addressed you disrespectfully. This may not be appropriate for a great being like you.\n\nWhen I came to this country, this was the biggest problem I had. Here, everybody called everybody by first name. Obviously, I was trained in India. And I said, \"Oh, Neil, you can call...\" I say, he's the president of our company of 200 people. I am not going to call him David. \"No, no, it's okay, call him David.\"\n\nBut very difficult for us to do that -- how can I say? Even today, after living here for 30 years, I have a client named Charles McFarlane, and obviously we call him Charles. He's about my age, so much younger than me. His father is 80-something and he used to be our senator, Granger McFarlane. But he's also part of this project which I'm doing. So Charles will say, \"Call my father.\"\n\nEverybody called him Granger. I said, I'm not going to do that. I call him Mr. McFarlane and call Charles, Charles. That's how I make the distinction. So now Arjuna, realizing this, says, I must have done something not right -- I called you Sakha.\n\nSo ajanata mahimanam avedam -- not that I want to disrespect you, but I did not know your greatness, that you are that all-pervading being. See, till we come to see God, we are not one with him, and therefore we always say, \"Oh God, you are so almighty.\" We never say, \"O my own self, which is almighty.\" Because who is seeking this relief from pain and unhappiness? Actually, the sufferer right now is none other than my ego. Something happens -- who gets hurt?\n\nSo who needs liberation? My ego can never be the God's self. So my ego says oh forgive me Lord. So here Arjuna says, O forgive me. In not knowing your greatness, I must have called you Sakha, Yadava, Krishna, whatever. Maya pramadat pranayana vapi -- pramadat, out of my lethargy in understanding you. I could have realized what I'm realizing today had I given enough thought to it. But it never occurred to me that I should put enough effort to know you.\n\nSo pramada pranayana vapya -- therefore I must have done this thing out of love for you. I liked you, I loved you. I just did not know your greatness. Therefore I could not give you the due respect which you deserve.\n\nJust continuing that -- Yacha avaha sartham asat krutosi vihara sayya asana bhujanesho -- while we were together, roaming around, sleeping in the same room, eating dinner, whatever, eating things together, I must have done things disrespectfully to you. Eko athwa api achyuta tat tamaksam tat kshamaye tvam aham aprameyam -- or when we were just alone, I must have done that. So he says, in any situation -- he's just enumerating what situations he must have done this in, whether in company or when they were together with other people.\n\nSometimes I say oh, it's okay that you insulted me because nobody was here. That's not good that you did that in front of my friend. Maybe I did it alone. But I may have done it even in front of other people. All of the tat shamaye. Please forgive me O Aapramayyam.\n\nBecause you are immeasurable. Basically, when an individual recognizes the Lord's greatness, in a sense we come to recognize that we are powerless in this world. And everything that we have achieved is because of his presence. Then all the credit we have taken, the ego we have developed -- all that, we feel so bad about it. I must have done all of this, O Lord, out of my own ignorance. But please forgive me. Then he says why the Lord should forgive him.\n\nLet me tell you why you should forgive me. Because I know and I now recognize that you are Pitasi Lokasyachara Acharasya. You are the father of this entire Jagat made up of chara and Achara. That means everything. Then nothing you can leave behind in it. You are the most respectful, worshipable Guru Gariyan.\n\nYou are the greatest teacher of all. I did not know all this. You may take some blame for that -- you are the greatest guru, and living with you, I still didn't learn all this. But you are the father of all the beings. Na tvat samo asti abhyadhikah.\n\nThere is no one greater than you. I now recognize your almighty power. I thought he is powerful and he is powerful and she is powerful, and I was running after them. But I realized, when I divide this world into plurality again -- none of them have independent power. You are the powerhouse of everything.\n\nIn these three worlds. These three worlds can be defined in many different ways. One is obviously Swarga Lok, Patal Lok, and this Lok -- or Swarga, Nark, and Prithvi Lok. But three Lokas generally in Vedanta mean: my waking world is one world, in which I have all these people who are more powerful than I am, and I'm trying to gain their favor.\n\nI'm trying to be in their company. Anytime we see somebody -- the president comes, everybody says, \"Mr. President, very glad to see you, sir.\" The president says, \"Very glad to see you also.\" He moves on because there are 5,000 people in a day he probably tells that to. We put the picture in our office.\n\n\"Neil with Obama.\" Obama probably doesn't care. There are thousands of pictures like that. \"Pretty close relationship.\" We all have pictures with Swamiji. \"We were very close to Swamiji.\"\n\nWas Swamiji close to us? But that's our ego basically tells us to do. But this also our way of showing respect. There is none greater than you. So in my waking world I have thought there are many. But none has power of their own.\n\nThey all derive power from you. So you are the greatest of all in my waking world. Same is true for my dream world. I derive power in my dream world because I am conscious. I am self aware in my dream. And my own mind creates my own world.\n\nEven there, none greater than you. And when I'm in deep sleep, there is no one. I'm completely ignorant. In my deep sleep there is no thought. In deep sleep, you are the only one who takes care of me at the time. None greater than in these three worlds.\n\nIn the last verse we see Tasmad -- therefore. Pranamya Pranidhaya Kayam -- therefore I bow down, bending my body. Prasadaye Tvam Aham Isham Idyam -- seeking your forgiveness, O adorable Lord. Now knowing your greatness, I adore you. We have learned what adoration is.\n\nIntensive form of love. Intensive love is intense identification. I am now bowing down to you with my body, with my mind, and with my intellect. Pita Eva Putrasya -- just as the father forgives his son, no matter what the son does, once he says, \"Dad, I'm sorry,\" that's the end of the story. No matter how bad it was. Okay my son, don't do it ever again. But I'm letting you go.\n\nAnd son knows that that trick works all the time. He said, because there's a love between the father and the son. No matter what it is, he forgives you. So you should do that. You are the father of the whole universe. That's another relationship where forgiveness comes very easy.\n\nYou and your friend are really mad at each other. And the other friend, you know, Neil, I'm so sorry I did that. That's the end of the story. Let's go see a movie together. It's a very different relationship. And then when you're in love, when somebody is beloved to you, no matter what differences you have.\n\nAnd you're mad at each other, as soon as one person says, \"I'm sorry,\" that's the end of the story.",
      "reflection": "Having recognized Krishna's true nature, Arjuna becomes acutely aware of how he has treated Krishna casually in the past. He recalls addressing him familiarly as \"Krishna,\" \"Yadava,\" \"Friend\" - calling him by first name, joking with him, perhaps even insulting him in jest during meals or leisure. \"Whatever insult I have offered to Thee in sport or in repose... alone or in a multitude, I ask Thy forgiveness.\" This is the natural response when we suddenly realize the divine was present all along in what we treated as ordinary.\n\nThis teaching applies directly to our relationships. The same consciousness that Arjuna saw in Krishna's cosmic form is present in every person we encounter. How do we treat the divine when it appears as our spouse, our child, our colleague, the stranger at the store? The casual disrespect, the thoughtless words, the failure to truly see the other - Arjuna recognizes these as offenses against the divine itself.\n\nToday, bring awareness to how you treat the people closest to you - precisely because familiarity often breeds carelessness. Notice when you dismiss, interrupt, or fail to fully see someone you interact with regularly. Arjuna's recognition that Krishna was \"O Thou Who art without an equal\" applies to the unique, irreplaceable consciousness in each person. Practice pausing before responding to a family member or close friend, and silently acknowledge: \"The divine is present here.\" Notice how this small recognition changes the quality of your interactions."

      "reflection": "Arjuna appeals to three relationships where forgiveness comes naturally: \"as father to son, as friend to friend, as lover to his beloved.\" Then he makes his request: \"I rejoice that I have seen what never man saw before; yet I am overwhelmed with fear. Please take again the Form I know.\" He asks to see Krishna with \"the crown, the sceptre and the discus\" - the familiar four-armed Vishnu form he grew up venerating. The cosmic vision, while revelatory, is more than he can bear.\n\nThis reveals something important about spiritual growth: we can only integrate as much truth as we are prepared to hold. Arjuna's request is not weakness but wisdom - he knows his limits. The cosmic vision showed him ultimate reality, but he needs to return to a form he can relate to, worship, and live with. Similarly, moments of profound spiritual insight often need to be followed by integration into ordinary life.\n\nReflect today on your own capacity to hold truth. Have you had experiences or insights that were overwhelming? How did you integrate them? Notice the balance between reaching for expanded awareness and respecting your current capacity. What \"gentle form\" of the divine can you relate to in daily life? What practice or image or relationship helps you connect with the sacred in a sustainable way? Honor both the aspiration for ultimate truth and the need for forms that support your current stage of development."

      "commentary": "So far we have discussed chapter 11. As we always try to remind ourselves, this chapter is all about the cosmic form of the Lord. Cosmic form of the Lord means the cosmic form of my own self -- the self which I know since I became aware of myself as this \"me.\" When that paradigm shifts and I see that as the all-pervading self, that's the paradigm shift that happened for Arjuna. We learn all this through the scriptures and religions and philosophy -- that there is a unity in this diversity -- but it is very hard to comprehend. And therefore we crave to have that experience of that unity.\n\nAnd Arjuna vocalizes our urge to see that unity to Krishna and said, I understand all that, but I want to experience it. I want to see that form of yours, O Supreme Lord, that I can understand all of that. And Bhagawan said, I'll show you. You won't be able to see it through your normal perception. The normal perception we have is I and the world exists. And therefore there is a duality.\n\nThere is a constant struggle between I and the world, where I define myself as me and the world as everything else. And then this world we divide into two: the world which I like and the world which I don't like. So our whole life pursuit is to align with the world which I like and avoid the world which I don't like. Vedanta says, all of life, the pursuit is to avoid what is unpleasant and to gain what is pleasant. And this pursuit creates the friction, and that creates more unhappiness, more dissatisfaction, because almost everyone around me is trying to do the same thing. And then we are in competition to get out of that race. If I can get that vision of oneness, then I can have that everlasting peace that I am seeking.\n\nSo Bhagavan showed this roop to Arjuna. And Arjuna sees this world without any space and time. The dividing factor between I and the world is the space and time. And once that is taken off, I see this world as one entity ever strung into each other by a common thread. But this is an overwhelming picture for Arjuna. So he said, I'm delighted to see this, but at the same time I am completely overwhelmed and I'm fearful.\n\nSo oh Lord, show me your form which is much gentler and which I am most comfortable with, which is that of Vishnu. We want to see Bhagavan in a form which is most comfortable to us, as we have discussed last time. So he says, show me with your form with the Kiritinam Gadinam, Chakrinam Hastam, with the crown and mace and Chakra which I'm so familiar with. Right from my childhood I've seen Vishnu's pictures and anytime somebody says, have you seen cosmic form? All of us say, oh yes, yeah, I've seen Bhagavad Gita pictures and you know, Shiva. Sure, because we have seen all the paintings of Shiva.\n\nSo we had a familiarity. We have formed an image of God in our head, and any image other than that -- the whole understanding that this Almighty is nothing but the source of all these beings and is all these beings -- is not really a comforting thought. Therefore, very conveniently, we divide the world into good and bad. Everything good happening is divine; bad happening is evil. Tsunami is evil, earthquake is evil. But in reality, it's all part of the whole phenomenon called this world. There's nothing evil or good about it.\n\nArjuna asked for that, and then Bhagavan said in his response -- Maya prasannena tava Arjuna, Idam Rupam Param Darsitam, Atma Yogat -- the last verse which we have seen. He said, I showed you the supreme form of mine graciously, because you are my devoted student, a friend, and a devotee. With my Yoga, with my power of changing your perception, I have showed you my form. Not that this form was never available. It is always available to those who can see it. Radio waves are always here for those who can tune into them -- the fact that we're not tuning into them doesn't mean they're not there. The form was always there. Arjuna did not have the capacity to see it. But my yoga gave you that perception which was Tejomayam Vishwam, Anantam, Adyam, Yanme tvad anyena Drishta Purvam -- the splendid and all-encompassing Vishwam, all-pervading infinite form which you have seen and not seen by any other before. Now, there are some saying that's not true -- Krishna already showed it to Yashoda. This is not an argument about the Puranas saying, who saw it first?\n\nThe point is that no one in this state of mind, state of evolution, state of understanding has seen this thing. If I say, \"Well, I actually saw it while driving down to work yesterday\" -- well, that's not true, not going to happen. Because then I won't be able to drive, because I lose that whole perception of the road, my car, and me as separate. I can't have these two together -- the perception of me and this world as separate, and the perception of me and the world as one and the same -- both at the same time.\n\nTherefore I say, nobody has seen it before you, you remaining you. Arjuna has seen this form. And then why this is not seen by others? Because others are trying to see this by the means which they find most convenient and appropriate. We are also trying to find that source of happiness which has infinite power to make us happy. So we try our own way.\n\nWe say we will have the best education. We want our children to be the happiest in this world. What are we going to do? We're going to make sure they go to the best schools, we'll make sure they have the best health care, will make sure they will have the best desk. But do they really turn out to be the best as we see it? Because what they are looking for, or let's put it this way, we think we have done the best for them to make them happy.\n\nDoes it make them happy? In fact, half the time what we have done to make them happy makes them most unhappy. But that's the only means which we know to transfer happiness to someone else.\n\nNa Veda Yajna Adhyayanair Na Danair Na Cha Kriyabhir Na Tapobhir Ugraih. All others are trying in this world -- by the Veda, by Dhyana, by learning Vedas. We want to learn. When I was a teenager and I see people talking about Bhagavad Gita and I used to say, I understand nothing, but someday I really want to know what they're talking about.\n\nSo we want to get the knowledge which we think the others have. So we learn Veda, Yajna, all the things which we think is good. With doing Dana, I remember in my childhood when Surat, when there is eclipse, everybody comes out in a street and then the beggars come and they know that now there's a big business time because people are doing dana at that time. Because if you do that it multiplies so many times. So Dana -- we obviously value the importance of charity. We have this notion that doing Dana, I get the merits, and that merit will earn me the vision of that source of infinite happiness, the Lord.\n\nYajna, Dhyana, Dana, Kriyabhi. Now actions -- obviously they translate as rituals, because religious actions in the traditional sense means ritual. I have to do this Archana or I have to do this Puja because that gives me merits, or do austerities or fasts. This many on this day, that many on that day -- all this. We are doing it to ultimately find that source of happiness which is infinite. I want that unconditioned happiness, unending happiness.\n\nAnd I want to do that by gaining this. Bhagavan very clearly says, na veda na kriyabhi na tapobhi. It's not that Bhagavan is condemning this. Somewhat in a putting-it-down tone, I said this -- that's not the intention. Those are the means to prepare your mind and intellect to a level where he will shine through. We have discussed that a seeker's job is only to do the Antahkarana Shuddhi.\n\nAs per our Vedanta, our job is simply to make our Antahkarana -- the internal instrument, which is mind and intellect -- to clean it up, make it ready for his reflection into it. Because right now it is so clouded with all the layers of our vasanas on it that the reflection is not clear. We have seen in Vedanta that three types of impurities can be there. The first is like smoke in front of a mirror. You can't see the reflection because there is smoke in front of the mirror.\n\nWell, it is very easy to dispel the smoke. But then there is the dust layer on the mirror. And third, we say, just as in the womb the fetus is enveloped in matter -- which is even more difficult. Our job with this mind and its impurities is simply to clean up the impurities. All this we have discussed is actually just for the Antahkarana Shuddhi.\n\nVeda, Dhyana, Yajna, Tapa, Dana, Kriya -- all that is for Antahkarana Shuddhi. If you are doing it for Antahkarana Shuddhi, it will gain its results. This is all I have to do, and I'm done with it. And therefore he says, you are not getting it through these alone. So Bhagavan says, evam rupah sakya aham nrloke --\n\nthis form of mine is not possible to be seen in this world of man. Drastum tvad anyena kuru pravira -- Arjuna is Kuru Pravira, the best among the Kurus. It is not possible in this world for anyone other than you to see this by these means alone, because these are the means and not the end -- which we normally confuse as the end. The next verse we just saw is Ma te vyatha. This is a verse which shows what state Arjuna was in. Ma te vyatha cha vimudhabhavah --\n\nDon't be disturbed and don't be fearful. I can see clearly on your face that you are disturbed, overwhelmed, and fearful by looking at this terrible form of mine. Drishtva rupam ghoram idrik mama idam -- having seen such a terrible form of mine. See, again, somewhere in the translation it says \"terrific form.\" But it says Ghoram, which means terrible. Whether it is terrible or terrific -- who decides that?\n\nFrom our point of view something may be terrible. From some other perspective it is terrific when somebody is taking those pictures of tsunamis from a distance from some satellite and then we are seeing those such a terrific form of tsunami. But guy at that whatever the beach where the tsunami is coming in Japan or wherever that is, it's a terrible form of tsunami. So he says, having seen this terrible form of mine -- because you are seeing it as a jiva, as a limited being, trying to comprehend this overwhelming nature of the self -- it's a terrible form. Vyapetabhih pritamanah -- with your fear dispelled, get your fear out, and pritamanah, have a loving nature again. Punastvam tadeva me rupam idam prapashya.\n\nAnd now see this form which will remove your fear -- a loving form. Now comes a little bit of a controversy. When Bhagavan came back from his Virat Swarupa, what form did he show? Arjuna had asked for Kiritinam Gadinam Chakrinam Hastam -- you know, Vishnu Roop. But Bhagavad Gita really doesn't say that. Some commentaries have said Bhagavad Gita simply says he came back to his original gentle form as Vasudev Krishna.",
      "reflection": "Krishna grants Arjuna's request to see a gentler form, then makes a remarkable statement: \"Never has it been seen by any but thee... Not by study of the scriptures, not by sacrifice or gift, not by ritual or rigorous austerity, is it possible for man on earth to see what thou hast seen.\" This seems to negate all spiritual practice - if study, sacrifice, charity, and austerity cannot grant this vision, what can? The answer lies in what these practices prepare us for rather than what they directly achieve.\n\nThe teaching here parallels success in any field. Going to architecture school does not guarantee becoming a successful architect - many graduates never practice. The training is necessary but not sufficient. What is also required is devotion and the grace of opportunities. Similarly, spiritual practices purify the mind and prepare us, but the actual vision comes through grace - it cannot be demanded or earned.\n\nFor today's practice, examine your relationship to spiritual effort. Are you treating practices as transactions - \"I did this much meditation, so I deserve that much peace\"? Or are you doing practices for their own sake, to purify and prepare, while remaining open to grace? The vision comes through grace, in its own time, to those who have prepared and remained humble. Today, do your practices with full effort and zero expectation. Offer the effort itself as worship, and release all claims to results."

The vision showed Arjuna ultimate reality, but he must live in the relative world, fight the battle, and fulfill his dharma. Spiritual experiences, however profound, must be integrated into daily life. Someone who remains permanently in cosmic consciousness cannot function in the world. The path involves expansion followed by integration, insight followed by application.\n\nReflect today on how you integrate spiritual insights into ordinary life. Have you had experiences of expanded awareness that you then had to bring back to mundane reality? How did that transition feel? The teaching suggests this is natural and necessary. The goal is not to escape ordinary life permanently but to transform how we engage with it. After touching the cosmic vision, Arjuna will fight the same battle, but with transformed understanding. What insights from your spiritual practice can you bring more fully into your daily activities, relationships, and challenges?"

      "commentary": "We have been discussing chapter 11, Viswarupadarsana Yoga -- the Yoga of Revelation of the Cosmic Form. We have seen in this chapter that Bhagavan showed his cosmic form. So what does that mean? The cosmic form is that form which includes all the forms in this cosmos, in this world, in this Jagat. All the forms at one place, from past, present, and future.\n\nSo that negates time. If there is no past, present and future, there is no time. If there is only one entity, one supreme being, then there is no time. I don't require any time to meet myself. I am always there, so there is no time required. It is when I have to meet somebody else, then I have to have time.\n\nThe two, it requires time and we can say we'll meet at 10 o' clock every Sunday morning. So as long as there are more than one, there will be time. If there's only one, there is no time. So in this cosmic form, everything is crunched into one. Past, present, future. There is no time also.\n\nIf there is one, there is no space. If there is one dot, the dot doesn't require any space. Instead of two dots, there is a distance between the two and there's space between the two. The space is created only when there are two. So in this, all forms are in one. Therefore there is no space also.\n\nBecause all forms are within that one form, that one form now becomes the form, the cosmic form. And therefore there is no space. So the space and time are both negated. In cosmic form, to have any form, what you require is space and time. Without space and time, there is no form. So the actual vision that Arjuna had was that of a formless space, supreme being.\n\nBut then he describes all these beings in it: I see Brahma, I see Vishnu, I see all the Siddhas, I see all Rakshasas, I see Dhritarashtra's sons. So in the supreme, all the probabilities -- infinite probabilities, the infinite amount of forms you can imagine -- you can create in that infinite.\n\nIt is something like if one of my clients comes to me and says, \"Neil, here is a piece of land. Design a building.\" I say, \"But what kind of a building? What do you want to use it for?\" If you leave everything up to me, I have infinite possibilities -- what I can design, what type of building I can design.\n\nThere I can say, it can be a hospital, it can be a jail. It can be an office building, a multi-storied office building. Maybe it's a single-story office building. No, no, it can be residential. Well, maybe multi-story. Infinite possibilities.\n\nTo really design a building, I have to eliminate all other possibilities and narrow it down to one. It can't be a hospital because it's not possible here, not needed here. It cannot be a jail because we have no authority to imprison anybody. I have to come down to negate everything until only one choice remains, and that becomes my choice. So for any form, it's necessary that you negate all other forms.\n\nSo when I say, let's say Prakashji comes to the room and I see Prakashji -- what I have to do is negate all 7 billion people on this planet. All remaining 7 billion people are not that; that's Prakashji. So to create a form from a probability of infinite probabilities in the supreme, I have to negate all other probabilities. Here, Arjuna can see whatever he wants to see. So is the case with us, because we see from a narrow perspective, we negate things, and it comes down to a particular form. So here Bhagavan showed Arjuna the supreme form which is formless but has infinite probabilities and possibilities of forms.\n\nSo that was the reason. And therefore Arjuna could see things which are delightful and those which are frightful. When it comes to the delightful, when we think about God as divine, it is very pleasant. But when we think about God who is also responsible for -- or also enabling -- the evil in this world, that is very frightful. Therefore we say, Bhagavan, I don't want to see that part of yours. Show me something which I can live with.\n\nSo that's what we have seen so far. Arjuna requested, put me back where I was before. So Bhagavan showed him the same Swarupa as Vasudeva, as Vasudeva's son which he was before as his charioteer. And then Bhagavan told him, look, this form of mine which you have seen -- which has all the forms included from past, present, and future -- is very difficult to see. It is auspicious but very difficult to see. And therefore nobody has seen it before.\n\nYou have seen it simply because of my grace -- Atma Yogat. By my yoga I could make you see this. But it is not possible to see through all the other preparations. Learning Veda, Dhyana, Yajna -- these are means but not the goal. You cannot achieve the goal by just preparing for it. Na aham vedena tapasa na danena ijyaya shakya evam vidho drastum -- as you have seen me, it is not possible through study of Vedas or austerities or charities or even sacrifices.\n\nIt almost looks like Bhagavan is discouraging us -- none of this is going to be helpful. But Bhagavan is actually making a statement of fact. We can learn from this verse the secret of success in anything. Can I become a successful architect just by going to architecture school? Many of my classmates are in the United States.\n\nThey all went to the same school. We all got the architecture degree. None of them are practicing architecture. They're successful in what they are doing. They own motels, they own gas stations and big houses and many cars. But they're not practicing architecture.\n\nSo just by going to architecture school, I cannot become a successful architect. So is the case with doctors, engineers. What makes a person a successful professional? The first thing is his devotion to the profession. He has to be devoted to his profession. When I came to this country -- big recession time, 1982, huge recession -- I was in Houston.\n\nPipe drafting was a big thing there because of all the oil companies. And people said, forget about architecture, do pipe drafting, you will make a lot of money. And I said, there's one thing I will not do, and that is leave architecture. I'll find jobs somewhere. Even drafting in architecture is acceptable, but not pipe drafting. So unless you are devoted to a profession -- that's the first requirement -- but even that doesn't make me successful as a designer of buildings, because I need the grace of my clients.\n\nI may be the best architect on this planet, but if there is no client that I can convince to let me design his or her building, then I won't be able to design. So to become a successful architect who can design a building and construct it, I need the grace of my clients. The ultimate thing I need is grace from the one from whom I am seeking that work, that achievement. But to get there, I have to do a lot more. I can't really just come out and say, \"I'm devoted to architecture, give me work.\"\n\nThat's also not possible. You have to train yourself continuously. So that you become proficient and efficient. Then somebody will see that you are capable of doing so. So Bhagavan said, two things I require. One is your devotion to your goal.\n\nAnd then grace from whoever is the fruit giver. Whoever is responsible to give you that work or that achievement. So Bhagavan says, Na aham vedair tapasa na danena ijyaya shakya evam vidho drastum drishtavanasi mam yatha -- you have seen me, but I am not possible to be seen through all these things alone. We think that preparing ourselves is good enough. But when it is not good enough, what you require is: Bhaktya tu ananyaya shakya aham evam vidho Arjuna jnatum drastum cha tattvena praveshtum cha parantapa.\n\nIt is not possible by just preparation. If you are devoted to me -- Bhaktya tu Ananyaya -- by single-minded devotion, it is possible. Bhagavan has given you the secret. What you really require is single-pointed devotion. And devotion, as we have discussed many times, is nothing but love for the divine. And love is nothing but identification.\n\nI love someone because I identify with that person. Because I identify with this class. I like to discuss Bhagavad Gita. You like to discuss Bhagavad Gita. I love people who come to this class. So this identification is love.\n\nI don't love my neighbour's child. As much as I love my own child. I identify with my child, my son. So love is nothing but pure identification. Without identification you cannot love anything or any being. So love for the divine is devotion.\n\nBut I cannot love the divine without knowing the divine. And therefore Bhagavan spent the last five chapters defining what the divine is, culminating in this Vishwaroop Pradarshan. So Bhagavan says it is possible. And then Bhagavan gives the steps of that vision: Jnatum drastum cha tattvena praveshtum cha parantapa.\n\nFirst you have to know. For identifying with anyone. I need to know that person. I have to know that person. I can't fall in love with a girl who I never met. I have to know her first.\n\nSo jnatum -- knowing first. In our studies we say the first is Shravanam -- listen to the scriptures, listen to the nature of the Lord. This is what we are doing. We are listening from Bhagavan. Then you will see me.\n\nThen you will know me. You will see me in my essence. Wherever I look, I see you. So that's the vision -- Drastum. In our path, through Mananam (reflection), I create a perception of what I have learned. Bhagavan's form is like that.\n\nAnd then I reflect on it. Have you seen calendar pictures of Vishwarup Darshan? The painters created those iconic images we've all seen -- Bhagavan with many heads and many arms and fire coming out of his mouth. Of course, painters have their limitations. But if you have listened to the five chapters carefully and then you reflect on it, then Bhagavan says, you will see me in my essence.\n\nThe last stage is Praveshtum -- then you will identify with me. Pravesham is to become one, to enter into that self. Right now, I am in my limited being. I'm completely identified with this body, this mind, this intellect.\n\nMy identification is so complete that there is no real rivalry between my right hand and left hand, my right leg and left leg. That is complete identification with this limited self -- i.e., praveshtum, entered into that \"me.\" Bhagavan says, if you reflect on that Vishwaroop, then you will also enter into that. You will identify with that supreme as you identify with your limited self right now. Here the operative word is Ananya Bhakti.\n\nWith single minded devotion, you shall be able to know me. You shall be able to see me. You shall be able to enter into me. The last word he gives us how to do that. So first he says, this vision is not possible without my grace. But it is possible if you are single mindedly devoted to me.\n\nBut how can I develop that single-minded devotion? Bhagavan answers in the last verse of this chapter. Mat Karma Krit -- the very first thing he says is, do everything for me. Continue doing everything you're doing right now. You think you're doing it for you, you're doing it for your family, you're doing it for your country. He says, just think -- it's all me.",
      "reflection": "Krishna now reveals the secret: \"Only by tireless devotion can I be seen and known; only thus can a man become one with Me.\" The word used is \"ananya bhakti\" - single-pointed, exclusive devotion. This is followed by a progression: know Me (jnatum), see Me (drastum), and enter into Me (praveshtum). These correspond to the traditional steps of shravana (hearing), manana (reflection), and nididhyasana (meditation/absorption). Knowledge comes first, then vision, then complete identification.\n\nThe key insight is that devotion (bhakti) is not mere emotion but deep identification. We love what we identify with - our children, our work, our country. Love and identification go together. To develop devotion to the divine requires knowing the divine (hence chapters 7-10 describing Krishna's nature), then seeing the divine in the world (the vision of chapter 11), and finally entering into complete identification where the sense of separation dissolves entirely.\n\nFor today's practice, work with the concept of \"ananya\" - single-pointed, without another. Examine where your devotion currently goes. Most of us are devoted to many things: comfort, success, approval, security, pleasure. These divided devotions scatter our energy. What would it mean to have all these secondary devotions organized under one primary devotion - to truth, to the divine, to consciousness itself? Begin by noticing when you serve lesser gods throughout the day. Each choice for immediate gratification over deeper truth is a moment of divided devotion."

      "commentary": "We have been discussing chapter 11, Viswarupadarsana Yoga -- the Yoga of Revelation of the Cosmic Form. We have seen in this chapter that Bhagavan showed his cosmic form. So what does that mean? The cosmic form is that form which includes all the forms in this cosmos, in this world, in this Jagat. All the forms at one place, from past, present, and future.\n\nSo that negates time. If there is no past, present and future, there is no time. If there is only one entity, one supreme being, then there is no time. I don't require any time to meet myself. I am always there, so there is no time required. It is when I have to meet somebody else, then I have to have time.\n\nThe two, it requires time and we can say we'll meet at 10 o' clock every Sunday morning. So as long as there are more than one, there will be time. If there's only one, there is no time. So in this cosmic form, everything is crunched into one. Past, present, future. There is no time also.\n\nIf there is one, there is no space. If there is one dot, the dot doesn't require any space. Instead of two dots, there is a distance between the two and there's space between the two. The space is created only when there are two. So in this, all forms are in one. Therefore there is no space also.\n\nBecause all forms are within that one form, that one form now becomes the form, the cosmic form. And therefore there is no space. So the space and time are both negated. In cosmic form, to have any form, what you require is space and time. Without space and time, there is no form. So the actual vision that Arjuna had was that of a formless space, supreme being.\n\nBut then he describes all these beings in it: I see Brahma, I see Vishnu, I see all the Siddhas, I see all Rakshasas, I see Dhritarashtra's sons. So in the supreme, all the probabilities -- infinite probabilities, the infinite amount of forms you can imagine -- you can create in that infinite.\n\nIt is something like if one of my clients comes to me and says, \"Neil, here is a piece of land. Design a building.\" I say, \"But what kind of a building? What do you want to use it for?\" If you leave everything up to me, I have infinite possibilities -- what I can design, what type of building I can design.\n\nThere I can say, it can be a hospital, it can be a jail. It can be an office building, a multi-storied office building. Maybe it's a single-story office building. No, no, it can be residential. Well, maybe multi-story. Infinite possibilities.\n\nTo really design a building, I have to eliminate all other possibilities and narrow it down to one. It can't be a hospital because it's not possible here, not needed here. It cannot be a jail because we have no authority to imprison anybody. I have to come down to negate everything until only one choice remains, and that becomes my choice. So for any form, it's necessary that you negate all other forms.\n\nSo when I say, let's say Prakashji comes to the room and I see Prakashji -- what I have to do is negate all 7 billion people on this planet. All remaining 7 billion people are not that; that's Prakashji. So to create a form from a probability of infinite probabilities in the supreme, I have to negate all other probabilities. Here, Arjuna can see whatever he wants to see. So is the case with us, because we see from a narrow perspective, we negate things, and it comes down to a particular form. So here Bhagavan showed Arjuna the supreme form which is formless but has infinite probabilities and possibilities of forms.\n\nSo that was the reason. And therefore Arjuna could see things which are delightful and those which are frightful. When it comes to the delightful, when we think about God as divine, it is very pleasant. But when we think about God who is also responsible for -- or also enabling -- the evil in this world, that is very frightful. Therefore we say, Bhagavan, I don't want to see that part of yours. Show me something which I can live with.\n\nSo that's what we have seen so far. Arjuna requested, put me back where I was before. So Bhagavan showed him the same Swarupa as Vasudeva, as Vasudeva's son which he was before as his charioteer. And then Bhagavan told him, look, this form of mine which you have seen -- which has all the forms included from past, present, and future -- is very difficult to see. It is auspicious but very difficult to see. And therefore nobody has seen it before.\n\nYou have seen it simply because of my grace -- Atma Yogat. By my yoga I could make you see this. But it is not possible to see through all the other preparations. Learning Veda, Dhyana, Yajna -- these are means but not the goal. You cannot achieve the goal by just preparing for it. Na aham vedena tapasa na danena ijyaya shakya evam vidho drastum -- as you have seen me, it is not possible through study of Vedas or austerities or charities or even sacrifices.\n\nIt almost looks like Bhagavan is discouraging us -- none of this is going to be helpful. But Bhagavan is actually making a statement of fact. We can learn from this verse the secret of success in anything. Can I become a successful architect just by going to architecture school? Many of my classmates are in the United States.\n\nThey all went to the same school. We all got the architecture degree. None of them are practicing architecture. They're successful in what they are doing. They own motels, they own gas stations and big houses and many cars. But they're not practicing architecture.\n\nSo just by going to architecture school, I cannot become a successful architect. So is the case with doctors, engineers. What makes a person a successful professional? The first thing is his devotion to the profession. He has to be devoted to his profession.

The ultimate thing I need is grace from the one from whom I am seeking that work, that achievement. But to get there, I have to do a lot more. I can't really just come out and say, \"I'm devoted to architecture, give me work.\"\n\nThat's also not possible. You have to train yourself continuously. So that you become proficient and efficient.

Whoever is responsible to give you that work or that achievement. So Bhagavan says, Na aham vedair tapasa na danena ijyaya shakya evam vidho drastum drishtavanasi mam yatha -- you have seen me, but I am not possible to be seen through all these things alone. We think that preparing ourselves is good enough. But when it is not good enough, what you require is: Bhaktya tu ananyaya shakya aham evam vidho Arjuna jnatum drastum cha tattvena praveshtum cha parantapa.\n\nIt is not possible by just preparation. If you are devoted to me -- Bhaktya tu Ananyaya -- by single-minded devotion, it is possible. Bhagavan has given you the secret. What you really require is single-pointed devotion. And devotion, as we have discussed many times, is nothing but love for the divine. And love is nothing but identification.\n\nI love someone because I identify with that person. Because I identify with this class. I like to discuss Bhagavad Gita. You like to discuss Bhagavad Gita. I love people who come to this class. So this identification is love.\n\nI don't love my neighbour's child. As much as I love my own child. I identify with my child, my son. So love is nothing but pure identification. Without identification you cannot love anything or any being. So love for the divine is devotion.\n\nBut I cannot love the divine without knowing the divine. And therefore Bhagavan spent the last five chapters defining what the divine is, culminating in this Vishwaroop Pradarshan. So Bhagavan says it is possible. And then Bhagavan gives the steps of that vision: Jnatum drastum cha tattvena praveshtum cha parantapa.\n\nFirst you have to know. For identifying with anyone. I need to know that person. I have to know that person. I can't fall in love with a girl who I never met. I have to know her first.\n\nSo jnatum -- knowing first.

In our path, through Mananam (reflection), I create a perception of what I have learned. Bhagavan's form is like that.\n\nAnd then I reflect on it. Have you seen calendar pictures of Vishwarup Darshan? The painters created those iconic images we've all seen -- Bhagavan with many heads and many arms and fire coming out of his mouth. Of course, painters have their limitations. But if you have listened to the five chapters carefully and then you reflect on it, then Bhagavan says, you will see me in my essence.\n\nThe last stage is Praveshtum -- then you will identify with me. Pravesham is to become one, to enter into that self. Right now, I am in my limited being.

That is complete identification with this limited self -- i.e., praveshtum, entered into that \"me.\" Bhagavan says, if you reflect on that Vishwaroop, then you will also enter into that. You will identify with that supreme as you identify with your limited self right now. Here the operative word is Ananya Bhakti.\n\nWith single minded devotion, you shall be able to know me. You shall be able to see me. You shall be able to enter into me. The last word he gives us how to do that. So first he says, this vision is not possible without my grace. But it is possible if you are single mindedly devoted to me.\n\nBut how can I develop that single-minded devotion? Bhagavan answers in the last verse of this chapter. Mat Karma Krit -- the very first thing he says is, do everything for me. Continue doing everything you're doing right now. You think you're doing it for you, you're doing it for your family, you're doing it for your country. He says, just think -- it's all me.",
      "reflection": "The chapter concludes with a comprehensive instruction: \"He whose every action is done for My sake, to whom I am the final goal, who loves Me only and hates no one - only he can realize Me.\" This single verse summarizes the entire path: Mat-karma-krit (actions for Me), Mat-paramah (I as supreme goal), Mad-bhaktah (devoted to Me), Sanga-varjitah (free from attachment), Nirvairah (without enmity toward any being). These five qualities together describe the integrated spiritual life.\n\nEach quality connects to the vision Arjuna has just witnessed. When you see that all beings are within the divine, acting for God means acting for the good of all. When you see that nothing exists outside the divine, making God your supreme goal means aligning with ultimate reality. Loving God only does not mean hating the world but loving the divine in and through the world. Freedom from attachment follows naturally when you see the temporary nature of all forms. And hatred toward any being becomes impossible when you recognize all beings as expressions of the One.\n\nFor your practice today, take these five qualities as a checklist. As you go through your day, ask: Is this action offered to the divine or serving my ego? Is my goal in this moment ultimate truth or temporary gain? Am I relating to this person with love for the divine presence in them? Am I attached to this outcome or free? Do I harbor enmity toward anyone? Do not expect perfection, but use these as orientation points. Each time you remember to check, you strengthen the pathways of spiritual awareness."

      "commentary": " Shri Purohit Swami did not comment on this sloka\n\nWhat is my purpose and destiny? So we had been discussing chapter one, Arjuna's Grief -- Arjuna Vishada Yoga. This is a contradictory term: Vishada and Yoga. Grief cannot be in Yoga; we are always in Yoga. But when we are in grief, this is the one time we really align ourselves to our own self, seeking an answer: how do I get out of this grief?\n\nSo grief also is one form of Yoga. In fact, it aligns you more to your own reality than when times are good, when we are more outwardly seeking things outside. When we are in grief, we seek inward and ask, how do I get out of this sorrow and find peace? So therefore this chapter is also called Yoga -- the Yoga of Arjuna's Grief. And the grief basically started with his looking at his situation.\n\nSo far we have seen that Dhritarashtra was curious about what's going on, out of his ignorance about the situation.\n\nCuriosity is the manifestation of ignorance. Unless we are ignorant, we cannot be curious. We can only be curious about something we are ignorant about. We cannot be curious about something we already know. So Dhritarashtra, being ignorant about what's going on, was curious about what's happening at the battlefield of Kurukshetra, so he asked Sanjaya. And then what we have seen is Sanjaya's narration.\n\nSanjaya first narrated what Duryodhan was doing. Duryodhana has gauged his situation, came to the conclusion we may not have enough resources. And then Bheeshma declared the war by blowing his own conch. And once he blew his conch, everybody blew their own conch. Now we have seen that the situation is such that everybody blew their own conches. And there was so much sound, there was so much chaos that everybody was trembling with fear.\n\nNow we are coming back to what Arjuna is doing. The last three verses say Vyavasthitan, Dhrushtva, Dhartarashtra, and Kapidhvajah. Having seen this -- the army of Duryodhana, Dhritarashtra's side, the Kaurava army assembled in the battlefield -- Kapidhvajah, the one whose flag has a monkey, Hanuman. Basically, Hanuman is a symbol of air, Marutasya putrah.\n\nSo basically his symbol says: my chariot flies like wind -- that powerful chariot, that's his symbol. So the one whose symbol is Kapidhvajah, Arjuna -- pravritte shastra sampate dhanuh udyamya pandavah. He saw that the people are ready to discharge their weapons, war is declared, everybody is anxious. And as I said, always the first person has to do something. One person blows the conch, everybody blows conches. The first person shoots an arrow, everybody starts shooting.\n\nNobody has shot the arrow yet, but everybody is anxious to discharge their weapons. So Arjuna also picks up his Gandiva. And then he says, Hrishikesham tada vakyam idam aha Mahipate -- O King. Sanjaya is addressing Dhritarashtra. Now that Arjuna has seen this army assembled in front of him, ready to discharge weapons, he has picked up his Gandiva. Basically, he's ready.\n\nHe probably wants to be the first one to shoot an arrow -- picks up the Gandiva. But then, as any good commander, he wants to make sure he has a complete understanding of what's going on. So then he says -- he said the following sentence to Hrishikesha Krishna, the one with the short hair. Now this is a half verse. This is where Sanjaya stops. Then we go straight to Arjuna.\n\nSo sometimes we hear Sanjaya's commentary; sometimes Sanjaya just puts it directly so we can listen to what Arjuna is saying or Krishna is saying. Arjuna uvacha: Senayoh ubhayoh madhye ratham sthapaya me Achyuta -- O Achyuta, another name of Krishna meaning one who never fails you -- take my chariot and station it right in the middle of the two armies.\n\nThis is basically something any general would do. When we are ready to attack Iraq or Iran, we say, \"Oh, we know they have WMDs.\" Well, we have the satellites to figure it out. We concluded that Saddam Hussein has all those WMDs -- weapons of mass destruction.\n\nAnd now therefore we are ready to attack him. Similarly, Arjuna said, well, let me be in a position where I can gauge the complete situation of who I have to fight so that I can strategize accordingly. Anxious soldier, anxious warrior, very confident, ready to discharge his arrow. He just wants his chariot to be in a proper location. And as Swamiji says, he shows his confidence. He says may ratham my ratha.\n\nSo he is a commander who is ready to give his command and do his duty. Yavat etan niriksheham. Why I wanted to do that because I would like to see Yudhung kaman, avasthitaan, which generals, which warriors are assembled in the other army. Obviously they didn't have satellite pictures. You have to have eye contact to figure out what's happening. So you need a station point where your perspective is panoramic, where you can see everybody.\n\nSo therefore it's a put me in a position where I can panoramically see who are assembled here. Duryodhana has already done that. Duryodhana went through who are on the other side. We haven't heard from Arjuna. Now Arjuna says I want to say Kair maya saha yuddhavyam asmin ranam samuddya me who are desirous of fighting at the eve of this battle. Eve of the battle, at just the beginning of this battle.\n\nLet me know with whom I must fight, who I'm going to fight. Yotsyamanam aveksheham ye ete atra samagatah Dhartarashtrasya durbuddher yuddhe priyachikirshavah. He shows his disgust for the people who are in their wrong notion. Yotsyamanam avekshe aham -- because I would like to observe those who are assembled. Ye ete atra samagatah -- they're assembled here. Dhartarashtrasya durbuddheh priya chikirshavah -- who are here to fight, wishing to please in battle the evil-minded son of Dhritarashtra.\n\nThey are pleasing somebody who has an evil mind -- Duryodhana. They are not really using their own judgment about what is right and wrong. They just want to please somebody, whether he is wrong or right, just because he is in power, just because he is someone they need to align with. So I want to see who those people are.\n\nVerse 24 onward is Sanjaya Vachana. We are getting back to Sanjaya: Evam uktva Hrishikesham Gudakesha Bharata senayoh ubhayoh madhye sthapayitva rathottamam.\n\nJust as he said, Krishna established the chariot thus addressed by Gurakesha. Just as instructed by Arjuna. Shikesha situated the best of the chariots between the two armies. This is where the turning point is. Here is how he sees what the situation is. Sometimes in our ignorance we are very comfortable in what we are doing because we do not know the rest of the story.\n\nSo we are very gung-ho on doing something. It is suddenly when we have the complete picture that what I'm doing is not just truly good -- it can also affect people. Go ahead and have this gas pipeline or whatever. The fracked gas looks very good. But it's when you have the complete picture of how many people get affected by it, what the effect on the natural resources is --\n\nThen you start questioning whether that is the right thing to do or the wrong thing to do. Till Arjuna did not have the clear picture, he was very gung-ho: \"I want to fight this battle. I'll kill those people who are aligning with this Durbuddhi.\" We will see what happens.\n\nWe completed chapter 11, Vishwarupa Darshan. Now we have started discussing chapter 12, Bhakti Yoga.\n\nSo we have learned so far in Bhagavad Gita about our limited self -- in the first portion, up to chapter five. Then it culminated into Dhyana Yoga. Once you know about the makeup of your being, you have to contemplate upon who I am. Everything we learned in that portion says that what I have considered myself to be so far is not me. Everything I considered as me -- this body, this mind, this intellect, my accomplishments, my relationships -- all this I considered to be me.\n\nAnd it turned out it is not me. I is something other than all these things. So contemplate upon the idea about who I am, that I am something other than this body, other than this mind, other than this intellect. And in that contemplation, what I find is myself. When I negate all the things which I currently consider as me, but turned out to be my equipment, my achievement, my accomplishment, my relationship, you negate all of that. And then what is left is Me.\n\nAnd that I is no different than the Supreme I. That's what we learned in that segment of Bhagavad Gita. So the next segment, which we embarked on learning was to know about the nature of the Supreme Self and how I can relate myself to the Supreme Self. So we have learned that his nature is imperishable, immutable, all pervading, omnipresent, omniscient. And everything in my world that I know is strung into him like the beads and necklace. So that segment, after discussing the nature of the self, ended with chapter 11 which showed the totality of that vision.\n\nIf I have that identification not with the limited self but with the greater self, what will be my vision of that Supreme Purusha, the Ultimate Being? Everything will be included in it. Once I have that understanding of the relationship between my limited self and that supreme self, it has to culminate in devotion toward the Supreme Self. Once I identify with the supreme self, I'll be devoted to that supreme self. So the next chapter is Bhakti Yoga, the Yoga of devotion.\n\nBut most of us really get scared by the very word bhakti. Because unlike Gnana and Karma, where I have some control, I have control over actions. At least I know that when I want to act, I will have the ability to act. It will be my will to engage in actions, so I can motivate myself to act. There is something I can do about it. Same way with knowledge -- I think I have some control; I can learn when I want to know.\n\nIf I think I'm ignorant about something and I really want to become knowledgeable, there are means available to me. If I can engage in it, then obviously I will get the knowledge. So with Gnana and Karma, we feel somewhat comfortable because we have something to say about it, some way to engage. But when it comes to bhakti, we are completely lost. Bhakti is an emotional response, and emotions are not something I have control over.\n\nThat's what I learned all my life that why did you do that, Neil? Because I couldn't control my emotions. I cried in public or I got angry in public. Emotions are something we are afraid that we may not have control over. So bhakti is an emotional response to something or someone I identify with. When I identify with someone, my emotional response is to like him or her or it.\n\nSo that's an emotional response and that we are very unsure about. That's what we get afraid of. Everybody says love God. Every religion says love God. Every teacher says, you should love God. But how should I love God?\n\nNobody has been very clear about this -- love does not come because I try hard. Trying to love someone is a very difficult thing. \"Neil, you should love him.\" \"But I don't like him.\" So we are very unsure about how to engage ourselves in Bhakti Yoga. Therefore, many teachers have defined Bhakti in different ways. There is a very authoritative book called Narada Bhakti Sutra.",
      "reflection": "Arjuna's question in these opening verses cuts to the heart of spiritual seeking: Should I worship the Divine with form or without form? Krishna's answer reveals that those who fix their minds on Him with unwavering faith and concentration are the \"very best\" devotees (yuktatamah). This teaching invites us to examine our own approach to the sacred. Bhakti, as explained here, is not merely an emotional sentiment but an alignment of the entire being toward the Divine. The word \"satatayukta\" (ever-steadfast) suggests that true devotion is not occasional temple visits or periodic prayers, but a continuous orientation of consciousness.\n\nConsider today: Where does your mind naturally gravitate when left unoccupied? What occupies your thoughts in the spaces between tasks? These moments reveal where your true devotion lies. The teaching suggests that genuine spiritual progress begins when we consciously redirect this natural flow of attention toward something higher. Try this practice: At three different moments today, pause and notice where your attention has wandered. Without judgment, gently bring it back to an awareness of the Divine presence, whether you conceive of it as a personal God or an all-pervading reality.\n\nAsk yourself: What form of the Divine feels most accessible to me right now? Is it the personal God I can speak to, or the vast, formless consciousness behind all existence? Krishna teaches that both paths are valid, but the personal path may be easier for those of us still identified with our bodies. What small step can you take today to strengthen that connection?"

      "commentary": "What is my purpose and destiny? So we had been discussing chapter one, Arjuna's Grief -- Arjuna Vishada Yoga. This is a contradictory term: Vishada and Yoga. Grief cannot be in Yoga; we are always in Yoga. But when we are in grief, this is the one time we really align ourselves to our own self, seeking an answer: how do I get out of this grief?\n\nSo grief also is one form of Yoga. In fact, it aligns you more to your own reality than when times are good, when we are more outwardly seeking things outside. When we are in grief, we seek inward and ask, how do I get out of this sorrow and find peace? So therefore this chapter is also called Yoga -- the Yoga of Arjuna's Grief. And the grief basically started with his looking at his situation.\n\nSo far we have seen that Dhritarashtra was curious about what's going on, out of his ignorance about what's happening.\n\nCuriosity is the manifestation of ignorance. Unless we are ignorant, we cannot be curious. We can only be curious about something we are ignorant about. We cannot be curious about something we already know. So Dhritarashtra, being ignorant about what's going on, he's curious about what's happening at the battlefield of Kurukshetra, he asked Sanjaya. And then what we have seen is Sanjay's narration.\n\nSanjaya first narrated what Duryodhan was doing. Duryodhana has gauged his situation, came to the conclusion we may not have enough resources. And then Bheeshma declared the war by blowing his own conch. And once he blew his conch, everybody blew their own conch. Now we have seen that the situation is such that everybody blew their own conches. And there was so much sound, there was so much chaos that everybody was trembling with fear.\n\nNow we are coming back to what Arjuna is doing. The last three verses say Vyavasthitan, Dhrushtva, Dhartarashtra, and Kapidhvajah. Having seen this -- the army of Duryodhana, Dhritarashtra's side, the Kaurava army assembled in the battlefield -- Kapidhvajah, the one whose flag has a monkey, Hanuman. Basically, Hanuman is a symbol of air, Marutasya putrah.\n\nSo basically his symbol says: my chariot flies like wind -- that powerful chariot, that's his symbol. So the one whose symbol is Kapidhvajah, Arjuna -- pravritte shastra sampate dhanuh udyamya pandavah. He saw that the people are ready to discharge their weapons, war is declared, everybody is anxious. And as I said, always the first person has to do something. One person blows the conch, everybody blows conches. The first person shoots an arrow, everybody starts shooting.\n\nNobody has shot the arrow yet, but everybody is anxious to discharge their weapons. So Arjuna also picks up his Gandiva. And then he says, Hrishikesham tada vakyam idam aha Mahipate -- O King. Sanjaya is addressing Dhritarashtra. Now that Arjuna has seen this army assembled in front of him, ready to discharge weapons, he has picked up his Gandiva. Basically, he's ready.\n\nHe probably wants to be the first one to shoot an arrow -- picks up the Gandiva. But then, as any good commander, he wants to make sure he has a complete understanding of what's going on. So then he says -- he said the following sentence to Hrishikesha Krishna, the one with the short hair. Now this is a half verse. This is where Sanjaya stops. Then we go straight to Arjuna.\n\nSo sometimes we hear Sanjaya's commentary; sometimes Sanjaya just puts it directly so we can listen to what Arjuna is saying or Krishna is saying. Arjuna uvacha: Senayoh ubhayoh madhye ratham sthapaya me Achyuta -- O Achyuta, another name of Krishna meaning one who never fails you -- take my chariot and station it right in the middle of the two armies.\n\nThis is basically something any general would do. When we are ready to attack Iraq or Iran, we say, \"Oh, we know they have WMDs.\" Well, we have the satellites to figure it out. We concluded that Saddam Hussein has all those WMDs -- weapons of mass destruction.\n\nAnd now therefore we are ready to attack him. Similarly, Arjuna said, well, let me be in a position where I can gauge the complete situation of who I have to fight so that I can strategize accordingly. Anxious soldier, anxious warrior, very confident, ready to discharge his arrow. He just wants his chariot to be in a proper location. And as Swamiji says, he shows his confidence. He says may ratham my ratha.\n\nSo he is a commander who is ready to give his command and do his duty. Yavat etan niriksheham. Why I wanted to do that because I would like to see Yudhung kaman, avasthitaan, which generals, which warriors are assembled in the other army. Obviously they didn't have satellite pictures. You have to have eye contact to figure out what's happening. So you need a station point where your perspective is panoramic, where you can see everybody.\n\nSo therefore it's a put me in a position where I can panoramically see who are assembled here. Duryodhana has already done that. Duryodhana went through who are on the other side. We haven't heard from Arjuna. Now Arjuna says I want to say Kair maya saha yuddhavyam asmin ranam samuddya me who are desirous of fighting at the eve of this battle. Eve of the battle, at just the beginning of this battle.\n\nLet me know with whom I must fight, who I'm going to fight. Yotsyamanam aveksheham ye ete atra samagatah Dhartarashtrasya durbuddher yuddhe priyachikirshavah. He shows his disgust for the people who are in their wrong notion. Yotsyamanam avekshe aham -- because I would like to observe those who are assembled. Ye ete atra samagatah -- they're assembled here. Dhartarashtrasya durbuddheh priya chikirshavah -- who are here to fight, wishing to please in battle the evil-minded son of Dhritarashtra.\n\nThey are pleasing somebody who has an evil mind -- Duryodhana. They are not really using their own judgment about what is right and wrong. They just want to please somebody, whether he is wrong or right, just because he is in power, just because he is someone they need to align with. So I want to see who those people are.\n\nVerse 24 onward is Sanjaya Vachana. We are getting back to Sanjaya: Evam uktva Hrishikesham Gudakesha Bharata senayoh ubhayoh madhye sthapayitva rathottamam.\n\nJust as he said, Krishna established the chariot thus addressed by Gurakesha. Just as instructed by Arjuna. Shikesha situated the best of the chariots between the two armies. This is where the turning point is. Here is how he sees what the situation is. Sometimes in our ignorance we are very comfortable in what we are doing because we do not know the rest of the story.\n\nSo we are very gung-ho on doing something. It is suddenly when we have the complete picture that what I'm doing is not just truly good -- it can also affect people. Go ahead and have this gas pipeline or whatever. The fracked gas looks very good. But it's when you have the complete picture of how many people get affected by it, what the effect on the natural resources is --\n\nThen you start questioning whether that is the right thing to do or the wrong thing to do. Till Arjuna did not have the clear picture, he was very gung-ho: \"I want to fight this battle. I'll kill those people who are aligning with this Durbuddhi.\" We will see what happens.\n\nWe completed chapter 11, Vishwarupa Darshan. Now we have started discussing chapter 12, Bhakti Yoga.\n\nSo we have learned so far in Bhagavad Gita about our limited self -- in the first portion, up to chapter five. Then it culminated into Dhyana Yoga. Once you know about the makeup of your being, you have to contemplate upon who I am. Everything we learned in that portion says that what I have considered myself to be so far is not me. Everything I considered as me -- this body, this mind, this intellect, my accomplishments, my relationships -- all this I considered to be me.\n\nAnd it turned out it is not me. I is something other than all these things. So contemplate upon the idea about who I am, that I am something other than this body, other than this mind, other than this intellect. And in that contemplation, what I find is myself. When I negate all the things which I currently consider as me, but turned out to be my equipment, my achievement, my accomplishment, my relationship, you negate all of that. And then what is left is Me.\n\nAnd that I is no different than the Supreme I. That's what we learned in that segment of Bhagavad Gita. So the next segment, which we embarked on learning was to know about the nature of the Supreme Self and how I can relate myself to the Supreme Self. So we have learned that his nature is imperishable, immutable, all pervading, omnipresent, omniscient. And everything in my world that I know is strung into him like the beads and necklace. So that segment, after discussing the nature of the self, ended with chapter 11 which showed the totality of that vision.\n\nIf I have that identification not with the limited self but with the greater self, what will be my vision of that Supreme Purusha, the Ultimate Being? Everything will be included in it. Once I have that understanding of the relationship between my limited self and that supreme self, it has to culminate in devotion toward the Supreme Self. Once I identify with the supreme self, I'll be devoted to that supreme self. So the next chapter is Bhakti Yoga, the Yoga of devotion.\n\nBut most of us really get scared by the very word bhakti. Because unlike Gnana and Karma, where I have some control, I have control over actions. At least I know that when I want to act, I will have the ability to act. It will be my will to engage in actions, so I can motivate myself to act. There is something I can do about it. Same way with knowledge -- I think I have some control; I can learn when I want to know.\n\nIf I think I'm ignorant about something and I really want to become knowledgeable, there are means available to me. If I can engage in it, then obviously I will get the knowledge. So with Gnana and Karma, we feel somewhat comfortable because we have something to say about it, some way to engage. But when it comes to bhakti, we are completely lost. Bhakti is an emotional response, and emotions are not something I have control over.\n\nThat's what I learned all my life that why did you do that, Neil? Because I couldn't control my emotions. I cried in public or I got angry in public. Emotions are something we are afraid that we may not have control over. So bhakti is an emotional response to something or someone I identify with. When I identify with someone, my emotional response is to like him or her or it.\n\nSo that's an emotional response and that we are very unsure about. That's what we get afraid of. Everybody says love God. Every religion says love God. Every teacher says, you should love God. But how should I love God?\n\nNobody has been very clear about this -- love does not come because I try hard. Trying to love someone is a very difficult thing. \"Neil, you should love him.\" \"But I don't like him.\" So we are very unsure about how to engage ourselves in Bhakti Yoga. Therefore, many teachers have defined Bhakti in different ways. There is a very authoritative book called Narada Bhakti Sutra.",
      "reflection": "These verses present a profound truth about the spiritual path: the abstract, formless approach to the Divine (Avyakta) brings \"greater hardships\" (kleso adhikatarah) for those who identify with the body. Krishna is not discouraging the path of formless meditation, but acknowledging a practical reality. The phrase \"dehavadbhir\" (for the embodied ones) points to our current condition: we are deeply identified with this physical form, its sensations, its desires, its limitations. To leap from this embodied identification directly to the formless Absolute is like asking someone who has never swum to cross an ocean. The verse about surrendering all actions to the Lord (\"sarvani karmani mayi sannyasya\") offers a more accessible doorway.\n\nThe key teaching here is \"sarvabhutahite ratah\"—being engaged in the welfare of all beings. True devotion expresses itself not in withdrawal from the world but in compassionate engagement with it. When you serve others seeing them as expressions of the Divine, every interaction becomes worship. This transforms ordinary life into a spiritual practice. Notice how different this is from devotion as mere ritual or sentiment.\n\nToday, practice this: Before each significant interaction, silently acknowledge that the person before you is an expression of the same consciousness that animates you. Whether it is a colleague, a family member, or a stranger, let your actions toward them be offerings to the Divine. At the end of the day, reflect: How did this shift in perspective change the quality of your interactions? Where did you find it easy, and where did resistance arise?"

      ],
      "commentary": "What is my purpose and destiny? So far we had been discussing the Bhakti Yoga chapter 12, and there are 20 verses in this chapter. It's a pretty small chapter because there is not much to tell you. Everything that has to be told is already told in the chapters before. So as we have discussed, from chapter six to ten we saw the Bhagavan's Vibhuti, his glory, his identification, how to find him in this manifest world. We saw in chapters 6 to 10 where he said, I am in the fragrance of flower, I am the sweetness of honey, I am even in the cheating power of the cheats.\n\nWhatever you can think of is the essence of a thing or a being. The Dharma of that being or a thing is me. A thing only exists because of its inherent quality to be its own Dharma. We are human beings because we have the basic qualities necessary for a human being. You take that away, you are no more a human being. If a person looks like Michael Jackson, you go near, but he doesn't move, we know it's just a Madame Tussauds Museum statue. That's not Michael Jackson. Because that statue does not have the inherent qualities required to be Michael Jackson. So that which makes you you, and I I, and it it -- Bhagavan said -- is me. We have seen that from chapter six to ten, and from that we should have developed a devotion to the Lord. But obviously that's not that simple.\n\nSo Arjuna asked Bhagavan in chapter 11, \"I understood all of it, but I want to experience it -- I can't experience it.\" So with Lord's grace, he gets a divine vision to comprehend this oneness in this manifest world, which is what we had been talking about. We just can't connect with that on our own. And Arjuna gets connected to that where he sees this manifest world as nothing but one being with many mouths, many hands, many legs, and many things happening. With that understanding, one should develop the devotion to that being, that one supreme Being who is nothing but my own self. So chapter 12 is the Yoga of devotion.\n\nOnce you contemplated who I am, realize the nature of the supreme and realize that myself and the supreme selves are not two different selves. I must instantaneously develop identification with that supreme self, which we call it a love for the Divine devotion. So this chapter is about all the Bhakti Yoga, how to unite with yourself by devotion. And we had been talking about various paths to attain that oneness with the Supreme. And we have talked about three different three distinct paths. Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Gnana Yoga.\n\nAnd we always get confused because of our cultural baggage. We have understood bhakti as something which happens in a temple or during bhajan time. \"I'm not that kind of bhakta. I don't really wear a mala and keep doing kirtan all day. I'm not a bhakta like that.\" So here is our chance to understand what bhakti really is.\n\nSo the chapter opened with Arjuna's two obvious questions. Should I be devoted to you in the form which I have seen -- you as Krishna or Rama or Shiva, Jesus, whatever -- whom I have now recognized as divine, while I'm a mortal, and put my faith into that one manifestation to achieve oneness? Or, as others discussed in the Vedas and Upanishads, should I worship that being which is Nirguna, Nirakara -- no qualities, no shape and form -- that all-pervading being in its unmanifest form?\n\nAnd obviously Bhagavan's answer was: one who gives his mind to me and has me as the supreme goal and does it with faith, he comes to me quicker. But the others who want to devote to the unmanifest, if they can do the following -- Samniyamya indriyagramam, all the senses under control, equanimous to all, where they can see the equanimity in this entire manifest world, where they can see that underlying thread in this world of plurality and diversity which binds this entire universe -- that thread which we already discussed in previous verses.\n\nSutre eva, Maniganaha eva -- just as a thread in a necklace of beads -- we can see that underlying unity. And then, Sarvabhutahite rataha, I'm constantly engaging myself in the welfare of all beings. Not just my group of people, my family, my people -- while other people can go wherever -- but Sarvabhuta hite rataha, the welfare of all.\n\nThen he also comes to me, Bhagavan said. And then obviously the question is, which one is better? Should I devote to a particular deity whom I feel closest to and most inspired by? And Bhagavan said, both are fine.\n\nBut Kleso adhikatarasteham -- those who devote to the unmanifest, it's a harder path. There are more obstacles on the way. For Dehavadbhih, those who are attached to the body, the first qualification required is to have Samniyamya indriyagramam -- all the senses under control. But if I'm not at that level and still have attachment to these senses and the body, no matter how intellectually I consider myself non-dualistic, that attachment to duality will bring me down. And therefore Bhagavan says for them it is more difficult if you are Dehavadbhih.\n\nNot just the indweller of the body, but one who is attached to this body. I never understood the meaning of samadhi -- they talk about it in meditation and all this. But one time Swami Tejomayanda explained it to me in one simple term. He was not addressing just me, but an audience.\n\nBut I got it. He said, \"You are in a state of samadhi all the time -- a samadhi with reference to your body.\" There is never a time where I am not identified with my body. Nobody has to wake me up and say, \"Neil, that's not you, that's you.\" I'm always in a state of samadhi with reference to my body. That's actually Dehavadbhih.\n\nI'm attached to this body. For me, clinging to this body as the ego-I and then trying to establish myself into the supreme unmanifest -- Bhagavan says Kleso adhikatarasteham, for them there are lots of difficulties. Therefore he said, the easy path is Mayyeva mana adhatsva. Give your mind to me and then do everything for me.\n\nAnd I will become your savior -- to save you from this ocean of samsara, this ocean of experiences which seems infinite. I don't see the end of it. So many times I thought I got it. We told Bhagavan, \"Oh Lord, just give me this, just give me a green card and I'll be fine.\"\n\nOh Lord, give me a green card. Because the green card these days takes about eight to ten years. I have somebody with me who has been here like six years now. I applied for his green card about three years ago, and we are renewing for the third time. So believe it or not, his prayer to the Lord is what?\n\n\"Oh Lord, give me a green card.\" After that I'm taken care of, right? Green card lets you stay here, do whatever you want to do. And as soon as you get the green card -- what? \"Oh Lord, find me the right partner.\"\n\nSo now I can settle down. And then it continues. Many, many times we thought there was an end to these difficulties, that once I get past this sorrow I'll be done. But the moment we get there we realize, no, no -- the infinite experiences which give me joys and sorrows never end.\n\nIt never comes with pure joy. What I really want to achieve is a state where there is no sorrow. But this Samsara -- Samsarati -- the constantly changing life of mine, these infinite experiences, I don't see the end of it. One thing ends, a new thing starts.\n\nBhagavan says, for those who have given their mind to me and have supreme faith in me, I become their savior. They are not capable by themselves of crossing this ocean of infinite experiences -- infinite experiences in a finite world. I will be the savior for them, to save them and take them to the other side.\n\nWhere there is no sorrow, where there is pure happiness -- what you are looking for. There is no ignorance about who I am, there is no death, there is no end of me.\n\nThere is no ignorance and there is no sorrow. So it's all about the mind -- that's what we figured out. Bhagavan never said give me your intellect and body. The intellect is nothing but a memory bank of my experiences; I think I know based on only my experiences. But the mind takes flight into the unknown and keeps on going.\n\nThere is a story about a Sankalpa Shali -- one who can't control his imagination. I'd heard a story in my childhood about a Brahmin's son who makes his living by getting bhiksha, alms. One day he got more bhiksha than he could consume. He said, \"Well, today was a good day and I got a lot of this bhiksha. I cannot consume all of it.\"\n\n\"So what I'm going to do is take the part which is left and sell it and make some money. Then what I'm going to do with that money? Well, I'll buy this and then I'll do this little business. Then I'll make more money, and then I will find a worthy partner. Then I'll get married.\"\n\n\"And then I will have children, and then children will come to me.\" And in his excitement he kicked -- he kicked that pot which had the flour in it, broke it, and it was all gone. His flight of imagination took him away, and he lost everything he was dreaming about. So Bhagavan said, that quality of the mind which we have seen is Sankalpa Shakti.\n\nYou need to curb that and put it in me. Nivasishyasi mayyeva ata urdhvam na samshayah. Fix thy mind in me, place thy intellect in me too. See, right now we are so dependent on our own intellect. Doubt comes to the mind. Almost everybody who learned Bhagavad Gita has said, \"All this is great, but I don't think you can succeed if you just continue like this.\"\n\n\"You have to have passion and drive, then only you can succeed in life. So learn this, but don't get hung up on it.\" Why? Because we are relying on our own intellect, which is nothing but a bank of finite experiences that tells us what succeeds and what doesn't. We have seen people like Steve Jobs and say, \"That's why they are succeeding -- I should be like that.\" Bhagavan said, no, don't rely on your intellect.\n\nIt will misguide you, because it does not have the capacity to go beyond the realm of your experiences. What you are trying to cross is the realm of your experiences. How can you rely on your intellect for that? You need to plug into the global database, the cosmic database. If I don't know anything, what do I do?\n\nI go on Google and see if I can find it. If I find it on Google, I'm fine. That entire database of the supreme intellect, that cosmic intelligence, I need to rest in that. I have to rest my intellect into that. Plug into not only my hard drive which is my intellect to the cloud computing connected to that Bhagavan. Not only give your mind to me but rest your intellect into me.\n\nRealize that there is a guide who will guide me once I put faith in him.",
      "reflection": "Krishna's promise in verse 7 is breathtaking: \"I rescue them from the ocean of life and death\" (mrityu-samsara-sagarat). The image of samsara as an ocean is powerful—endless waves of experience, joy and sorrow rising and falling, with no shore in sight. We have all felt this: the moment we achieve one goal, another desire arises. Green card leads to wanting a partner; partnership leads to wanting children; children bring new anxieties. The cycle seems infinite. Yet Krishna offers Himself as the rescuer for those whose minds are \"fixed on Me\" (mayy-avesita-cetasam).\n\nThe practical instruction in verse 8 is remarkably direct: \"Let thy mind cling only to Me, let thy intellect abide in Me.\" This is not passive wishing but active engagement. The mind must be placed (adhatsva) in the Divine; the intellect must be established (nivesaya) there. As the teaching explains, our intellect is like a personal hard drive with limited data from our finite experiences. Devotion means plugging into the \"cosmic database\"—trusting a wisdom greater than our own accumulated knowledge. When doubt arises about decisions, ask: Am I relying solely on my limited experience, or am I open to guidance from a higher intelligence?\n\nVerse 9 offers compassionate encouragement for those who struggle: \"If thou canst not fix thy mind firmly on Me, then try to do so by constant practice\" (abhyasa-yogena). This is the path for most of us. Practice today by setting three reminders on your phone. When each reminder sounds, pause whatever you are doing and consciously place your attention on the Divine for just one minute. Notice how the mind resists, wanders, returns. This is abhyasa yoga—patient, persistent practice without expectation of immediate perfection."

      "commentary": "We have been discussing Chapter 12, Bhakti Yoga, the Yoga of Devotion. In our scriptures, generally there are three paths prescribed: Karma Yoga, Gnana Yoga, and Bhakti Yoga. Most people consider Bhakti Yoga to be the easiest path because it requires no special training, no special arrangement. You can just go and worship the Lord.\n\nYou go to the temple, you sing bhajans. So most people feel it is more comfortable and much easier to practice Bhakti Yoga than Karma Yoga or Gnana Yoga. That's our general understanding. But it turns out Bhakti Yoga is the most difficult path to follow, because Bhakti is the emotional response to something we adore or something we worship. Devotion, as we have discussed before, is nothing but love for the divine. Narad Ji defines Bhakti in his Narad Bhakti Sutra as Sa Tasmin Premarupa -- it is of the nature of love. It is the nature of immortality. Yat labdhva puman siddho bhavati -- once a person achieves that Bhakti, becomes established in Bhakti Yoga, that person becomes Siddha, accomplished. Amritva bhavati -- he becomes immortal. And Tripto bhavati -- he becomes completely satisfied.\n\nSo to achieve that state is not very simple. So what we find actually is it is easier for me to practice Karma Yoga. Karma Yoga is something related to my actions. I consider it is in my control. How I act in this world is something I can control. So Karma Yoga is related to my organs of actions and how I perform my actions in this world which I consider I have some control over it.\n\nAt least I can attempt to practice Karma Yoga. And then Gnana Yoga is related to the intellect -- acquiring knowledge. That again I find is something in my control. I can make a choice that I want to learn this or that. If I want to learn about physics, I can make a resolve, go to the physics department, learn physics.\n\nSo knowledge is something I find within my choice to pursue, just as actions are within my choice to pursue. But Bhakti is related to the mind. It's an emotional response. Nobody can say, \"I'll fall in love in 2025.\" You cannot plan falling in love.\n\nIt really does not go by your planning or your calendar. The love will only come if I know the divine. And therefore, we have gone through five chapters in this segment, from the 7th through the 11th, to know the Supreme Lord. In chapters 10 and 11, Bhagavan has given Arjuna all the required information -- chapter 10 gave all the Vibhutis in the manifest world, then chapter 11 gave him the total representation of his nature. If you have been equipped with that level of knowledge, then Bhakti actually becomes an automatic response. However, it is still related to the mind.\n\nAnd therefore Bhagavan starts this chapter by saying, fix your mind onto me. No matter what amount of knowledge I may have intellectually or how much activity I have performed, it is the mind which decides my next destination. It is the mind which will have the desire to explore new things. So Bhagavan said, attach your mind to me.\n\nWe have seen in the last few verses that Bhagavan has clarified: focusing your mind on one particular form is the easiest way to do it. That does not mean Bhagavan is simply saying idol worship is all you have to do.\n\nSo we discussed last time whether idol worship is acceptable or not. It is one form, one means to achieve bhakti. Most of the time when we consider Bhakti, we think simply: \"He is going to the temple and singing bhajans, so that's the sum total of bhakti.\" And Bhagavan said, that's not true. It is your mind that matters, not the activity of going to the temple, not the singing.\n\nSwamiji used to say, bhajans with noisy instruments -- that's not Bhakti. Bhakti is where the mind penetrates the nature of the Lord and fixes itself to that form. Bhagavan said, the first requirement is: fix your mind onto me. Your mind and intellect should be firmly established in that supreme knowledge. That's what we've been learning throughout these last five chapters.\n\nNothing exists other than his self. What I see through my senses is his lower nature. What I do not see but feel as my own existence, my own consciousness, is his higher nature. I cannot vouch for any other person's consciousness, but I can vouch for my own -- because I feel I exist, and that nobody can take away from me. This consciousness cannot be displayed in any other way than when I act outside. Then you can say, \"He's speaking, he's talking, he's alive.\"\n\nSo that is the higher nature. The consciousness which makes this inert equipment function in this world is the higher nature. If you understood these two, then \"focus your mind onto me, constantly think about me\" does not mean you have to drop everything and start thinking about him. But whatever you think, in the back of your mind you should know that he is the enabler of this thought. Without his presence, without this consciousness, this mind cannot even run away in different directions. At least you should have that as a background thought.\n\nJust as in music you have the Shruti playing in the background -- nobody pays attention to the Shruti. But the moment you miss the Shruti, you are done with your bhajan. If you pay attention to the Shruti, the entire music falls in place. Once you miss it, everything is haywire. Our Shruti should be that I am that Satchitananda -- this consciousness is me.\n\nBut when we miss that and ignore that, the music of our life falls apart. Bhagavan said, therefore Mayy aveshita mana, and then Buddhi niveshaya -- place your intellect into me. So now that intellectually we appreciate that Bhagavan is everywhere, that there is nothing that exists without Bhagavan, that everything I see is Bhagavan alone -- now my intellect reminds me every time I transact in this world.\n\nThen no matter what I think about, the party I'm dealing with is nothing but his own representation. And Bhagavan said, if you keep that in mind, you will never be able to do anything wrong. You will not be able to perform any crime. And therefore he says, Nivasishyasi mayyeva ata urdhvam na samshayah. If you constantly keep this thought in your mind and have your intellect constantly remind you that whatever you are dealing with in this world is nothing but his Prakriti, then you will come to me. You will reside in me.\n\nThere is no doubt about it. So Bhagavan has clearly clarified: Bhakti is all about mental control, having the mind focused on the supreme reality. We find that actually very difficult, because we all have admitted that controlling the mind is not that easy.\n\nSo Bhakti is actually a destination. You start your journey from Karma Yoga. If you have no other training in spirituality and somebody says this is the path, then the easiest path is Karma Yoga, because you can control your actions. When you purify mind and intellect through action, your intellect becomes ready for knowledge. Then once you get knowledge, you really have to do nothing.\n\nYou don't have to do anything. Bhakti will reveal itself automatically in your mind. It's like when you fell in love -- you didn't even realize when you fell in love. You started knowing about her at some point, and you didn't realize when it happened.\n\nThere is no timeframe -- you can't say on such and such date I fell in love. I went to a music teacher when I was in my late 40s, and I kept saying, \"Subhashi, I really have trouble understanding what you are saying. I understand it, but I don't feel it. You're telling me I'm out of rhythm, but I don't know when I'm out of rhythm.\"\n\nWhen I stopped going to class, at some point I started understanding it -- I'm out of scale, I'm out of rhythm. And when that happened, I cannot pinpoint when the knowledge of scale and rhythm came. There is no timeline for it. But it was because of the music classes I took. This is what happens when knowledge matures into skill. So Bhagavan said, all you have to do is purify your mind and intellect.\n\nPut your mind and intellect in me and this will happen automatically. Once you achieve Bhakti, as Narad Muni said, it is Amrita Swarupa. You will have no fear of death. You will feel Tripta -- completely satisfied. You will have nothing more to achieve in this world. But Bhagavan is very kind and said there are alternates.\n\nIf you don't think that is possible for you even after going through the last five chapters, then he said, if you are not capable of controlling your mind, just perform Abhyasa Yoga. Abhyasa Yoga is simply to keep reminding yourself that you are deviating from what you have learned and to try to bring the mind back to its goal. It's constant practice. Practice makes you perfect. By practice, you can train wild animals in a circus.\n\nSo obviously you can train your mind. If wild animals can be trained, your mind can be trained -- it's a matter of how much practice you put in. Bhagavan says, just keep practicing. But somebody like me says, \"Bhagavan, even that's really difficult. I get so distracted by my thoughts that I even forget to remember that I have to bring my mind back to where it should be.\"\n\nAnd Bhagavan has already said in chapter seven that all my devotees are Udaraha -- noble people. No matter what level they are, Udara Sarvaivaithi, they are all good people performing good actions. No matter how incomplete they are, no matter how incapable they are of realizing their own self.\n\nBut they're good people. At whatever level you are -- whether at a kindergarten level or a high school level -- you can start your journey towards your goal. Abhyase api asamarthosi matkarma paramo bhava. Then perform actions for me. But keep in mind that you are doing it for the Lord.\n\nIn the sense that if I have come to realize that there is nothing but the Lord alone, then whoever I serve, I'm serving him. In your profession, when you serve your clients, keep in mind that the client is nothing but his own representation. You serving him is serving the Lord. You serve other people -- they are also forms of the same Lord.\n\nAnd therefore I'm serving Him. So keep that thought in mind: I am performing all actions for him only. Madartham api karmani kurvan siddhim avapsyasi -- even just by performing actions for me, you can achieve that perfection. You don't have to meditate. You don't have to do any kind of tapas.\n\nBut keep performing your actions for me alone, and keep in mind that you're not doing it for yourself. This limited self has to be removed from the equation. Now I want welfare of all beings. But even that is not possible for some. You are so self-focused that you can't think about anybody but yourself.\n\n\"What I'm doing is for myself\" or \"I am the doer\" -- the ego is so strong. Bhagavan says, Atha etad api ashakto asi -- if you are even incapable of doing so -- then Kartum madyogam ashritah sarva karma phala tyagam. If you cannot perform all actions for me, perform actions for whatever purpose you were performing before -- for accomplishing things, achieving respect in society, your big bank balances, all that.\n\nContinue doing the same thing you are doing. But give up the anxiety for the fruits.",
      "reflection": "These verses reveal Krishna's extraordinary compassion as a teacher. He offers a descending ladder of practice for aspirants at different levels. Cannot fix your mind on the Divine? Practice concentration (abhyasa). Cannot practice concentration? Perform actions for His sake (mat-karma). Cannot even do that? Simply renounce the fruits of action (sarva-karma-phala-tyagam). The teaching meets us exactly where we are. Verse 12 presents a remarkable hierarchy: \"Knowledge is superior to blind action, meditation to mere knowledge, renunciation of the fruit of action to meditation, and where there is renunciation peace will follow.\" The culmination is telling—peace (shanti) comes immediately (anantaram) from letting go of attachment to results.\n\nThis is profoundly practical wisdom. Most of our mental suffering comes not from our actions themselves but from our anxious attachment to their outcomes. We plan for the green card, then the partner, then the children, then their education, then their success—an endless chain of anxiety about future results. Krishna does not ask us to stop acting or even stop planning. He asks us to release the grip of anticipation, to act fully while holding outcomes lightly.\n\nToday, choose one task that normally causes you anxiety about results—perhaps a work presentation, a difficult conversation, or a creative project. Before beginning, consciously offer both the action and its outcome to something greater than your ego. Perform the task with full engagement, but notice when the mind starts calculating results. Each time it does, gently return to the present action. At day's end, reflect: Did this shift bring any measure of peace? The teaching promises it will—not eventually, but \"anantaram,\" immediately."

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 12. This is Bhakti Yoga, the Yoga of devotion. As we had been discussing, the Bhagavad Gita is the science of self-improvement. We started out with the first section of the Bhagavad Gita to understand who we are, how our body, mind, and intellect function, and how we can perform the most effective actions. That segment ended with meditation.\n\nOnce you understood what is myself and what is not myself, you have to contemplate on it, meditate on it -- to move this identification from this limited self, which is very natural to us (\"you consider this is me\"), to that supreme Me, the self which is all-pervading. And then we have seen the Lord's nature. Once you identify with the self, what is the nature of that self? What do I need to meditate on?\n\nSo in chapters seven through eleven, we have seen the nature of that self, that all-pervading self, and that segment ended in Bhakti Yoga, the Yoga of devotion. The identification with that supreme self is devotion to that supreme self. We have many times discussed this: devotion is love. And divine love is nothing but identification. Identification only comes by finding our common traits, our common ground. Our common ground with the supreme self is: I want happiness -- unlimited happiness, unlimited existence, and unlimited bliss.\n\nThis is what I'm looking for in my life. Scripture says the only way you can achieve it is once you identify with that self. So Bhakti Yoga is the yoga of devotion -- how to achieve that identification. We have seen there are two ways of meditating upon the supreme: either with form or without form. And Bhagavan said, with form is easier for one who is associated with the body, one who is more attached to this body, this limited ego.\n\nIt's easier to identify with the Lord with the form, whatever form that you and I can assign for our own personal God. And then he says, what is devotion? He said, devotion is the complete surrender of my mind to Him. Right now, my mind is surrendered completely to my ego. My mind and intellect have identified completely with my ego. And therefore I am one with my ego.\n\nMy identity is my ego. And therefore all the limitations of my mind and intellect are now the limitations of myself, as identified with the ego. The sorrows I'm experiencing in life, the unhappiness I'm experiencing -- these are because of these limitations. My inner self is seeking complete happiness, unending happiness, unbound happiness. But I am identified with my ego, and therefore the limitations of my mind and intellect are creating unpleasant situations.\n\nSo to get out of this situation, the only way I can achieve that perfect happiness is by identifying with that supreme self -- the self which is residing in me, residing in you, residing in him, residing in her, and in everything that we perceive, think, and consider as our world.\n\nTherefore, Bhagavan in the last seven verses of this chapter, starting from verse 13, enumerates the qualities of a true devotee -- a true Bhakta who has surrendered his or her mind and intellect to the supreme self. Now the mind and intellect have become instruments of the supreme Self, the Lord we have seen.\n\nIn the last two verses we discussed -- verses 13 and 14 -- Bhagavan has enumerated 11 qualities of a true devotee: Adveshta Sarvabhutanam, Maitrah, Karuna evacha, Nirmamah, Nirahankara, Samaduhkha-sukhah, Kshami. He hates no creature, he is friendly to all beings, he's compassionate, he has no ego, he has no sense of attachment, he is balanced in pleasure and pain. Santushtah satatam yogi, yatatma, dridha-nishchayah. He is ever content, steady in meditation about who he is.\n\nHe is self-controlled and possesses firm conviction, with mind and intellect dedicated to the supreme self. Bhagavan says, such a person is my Bhakta, and he is dear to me.\n\nContinuing the same description of the true devotee, Bhagavan describes in verse 15: Yasmat na udvijate Lokah -- he by whom the world is not agitated. If my presence makes the world around me agitated, then obviously there is something I need to correct in myself.\n\nWe have experienced this all the time. Some people can just enter a room and suddenly the room is in a positive, joyful mood. They bring that joy, that enthusiasm, that excitement into the room. And some people come in and there is gloom and doom. We have experienced this with our day-to-day acquaintances and friends. But most profoundly, we have experienced this in the presence of a Mahatma.\n\nI have experienced this in the presence of Swami Chinmayananda, where people used to sit for hours, including myself, without doing anything -- just sitting in front of him and watching him. It gives you such peace in your mind that you just don't want to leave. When Swamiji would come, all the devotees would get together. Those who were close to him would get a chance to be with him, just be in his room. And Swamiji would be doing whatever he was doing.\n\nHe'd be watching tennis -- Swamiji used to love watching tennis after lectures. Somebody would have taped the Wimbledon matches or whatever tournament, and he would be watching that. And other people would just be watching Swamiji, feeling peace.\n\nIn the very early days of my exposure to spirituality, my mentor at the time was a chief architect where I used to work as an intern architect.\n\nAfter the first year of architecture school, during a vacation, he took me to Sant Mota in Surat. At the time I didn't understand much, but because my chief architect told me I should come with him, I went along. Somebody asked Sant Mota a question: \"How do we know that a person we are meeting is a true saint? Because he could be a cheat, just putting up a show and deceiving people.\"\n\nAnd Sant Mota said, there is only one test for it. If in his presence you feel peace, he is a true sadhu or sanyasi. If in his presence your mind gets agitated, consider that person not a genuine saint. At that age -- I was only about 17 -- I couldn't understand how that could be. But over the years I've experienced that in the presence of a Mahatma, peace prevails in your mind. Automatically, he projects his peace into your mind and into everyone around him.\n\nSo Bhagavan said, Yasmat na udvijate Lokah -- he by whom the world is not agitated. His presence brings peace and joy to the people around him and the world around him. We have heard that in the presence of Lord Buddha and such Mahatmas, even animals would sit down in front of them and feel peace. Lions and tigers have been calmed by Lord Buddha. Lokat na udvijate cha yah -- neither does he agitate the world, nor can the world agitate him.\n\nSo these are the qualities you find in a true devotee of the Lord: in his presence you will experience joy, and the agitation in your mind will not affect him. Sometimes everything is going well at home. But as soon as I come from my office, I create agitation in the house, because I bring my agitation from the office into the home.\n\nAnd now my household, which was peaceful without me, is agitated because of my presence. That's why we typically have that threat to our children: \"Well, you just wait -- dad is coming.\" That means there will be turmoil and agitation in the house. \"So you behave and don't add any more agitation to his agitation.\" We put so much burden on our children to calm down their parents.\n\nObviously I'm joking. So Bhagavan said that my devotee is such a person who brings peace to this world and does not get agitated by this world. Harsha, Amarsha, Bhaya, Udvega Muktah -- free from elation, envy, fear, and anxiety. Such a person, Bhagavan says, Yah sa cha me priyah -- he is closer to me. This does not mean that Bhagavan is partial to him.\n\nRather, he feels the peace prevailing in the supreme self as his own peace, and therefore he is closer to him. Continuing in the same vein, the next two verses form the third segment of the qualities of a true devotee: Anapekshah, Shuchih, Dakshah, Udasinah, Gatavyathah. So far in the previous stanzas we have seen about 14 characteristics of a true devotee. In this stanza we see six more.\n\nAnapekshah -- he is free from all wants. He has no expectation from this world. Now these are very difficult concepts for you and me to understand, because we live in a world where expectation, anticipation, and performing to someone's expectations are a normal part of our vocabulary -- in the business world, in our regular world. But what we are talking about here is our internal world.\n\nWe are not talking about the world outside, where I deal with my peers, my superiors, my enemies, and my competitors. That's the world my ego has created. The world we are concerned about is the world of my inner self. For that inner self, there is no real enemy, no real competitor, because the same self which is pervading the entire Jagat is also residing in me.\n\nAnd I'm trying to get in contact with that. Once I am in touch with that, Bhagavan said, you will have no Apeksha. I am satisfied by my own self, and therefore I have no other expectation from the world. Up till now, my expectation was that the world will make me happy. My children will grow up and do this and that, and they will make me happy.\n\nMy wife will do this and that will make me happy. My friends will do this and that will make me happy. I have mortgaged my happiness with all the people I know, but have not left anything for me to do. So now I have no control over my happiness -- I have to rely on the people with whom I've mortgaged it. They have to do something to make me happy.\n\nMy children have to perform well in their studies or in their sports or whatever I expect them to do. My wife has to perform according to my desires. My friends have to behave the way I want. When they do that, I'll be happy. So I mortgage my happiness. And therefore I have Apeksha -- expectations from the world to make me happy.\n\nBhagavan says my devotee is Anapekshah. There is no expectation because he is the reservoir of his own happiness. Shuchih -- someone who is devoted to the Lord cannot be filthy and dirty, both in his own mind and intellect, and also in his surroundings. He will live a clean life, both inside and out.\n\nWhen your mind is clean you automatically will make your environment around you clean. It has a reverse effect also. When my environment around me is clean it will calm my mind down and my mind will be clean too. Dakshah -- there is no laziness in him.",
      "reflection": "These verses begin Krishna's portrait of the ideal devotee, and the qualities are striking: \"Adveshta sarvabhutanam\"—incapable of hatred toward any being. Not merely controlling hatred, but being constitutionally incapable of it. \"Maitrah karunah\"—friendly and compassionate. \"Nirmamah nirahankarah\"—free from possessiveness and ego. \"Samadukhha-sukhah\"—balanced in pain and pleasure. These are not commandments to follow but descriptions of what naturally emerges when the mind is surrendered to the Divine. The devotee does not struggle to be compassionate; compassion flows naturally when the ego-barrier dissolves.\n\nVerse 15 offers a powerful diagnostic: \"He who does not harm the world, and whom the world cannot harm\" (yasmat na udvijate lokah, lokat na udvijate ca yah). The teaching illustrates this beautifully with the example of Sant Mota's test for a true sadhu: if you feel peace in someone's presence, they are genuine; if you feel agitated, they are not. Consider: What effect does your presence have on others? When you enter a room, does the atmosphere lighten or tense? This is not about being artificially pleasant but about the natural radiation of an untroubled mind.\n\nFor today's practice, focus on the quality of \"kshami\"—forgiveness. Identify one person toward whom you hold resentment, however small. You need not contact them or resolve the situation externally. Simply sit quietly and consciously release the grip of that resentment. Notice how the mind wants to justify holding on—\"But they really did wrong me.\" Acknowledge that and release anyway. True forgiveness is not about condoning actions but about freeing your own mind from the prison of grievance. Observe: Does this release bring any taste of the peace Krishna describes?"

      "commentary": " Shri Purohit Swami did not comment on this sloka\n\nWhat is my purpose and destiny? We have been discussing chapter 12, Bhakti Yoga, Yoga of Devotion. The first six chapters described Karma Yoga -- the Yoga of action -- teaching us who we are as individuals, how our actions function, and how we can make our actions more efficient. We have seen two definitions of Yoga: Samatvam Yoga Uchyate and Yogah Karmasu Kaushalam. The equanimity of mind is Yoga, and the dexterity in action is also Yoga.\n\nYou can only be dexterous in your actions if your mind is quiet. That was the technique we learned in the first six chapters. And at the end of those chapters we had Dhyana Yoga, the Yoga of Meditation. Bhagavan said, I consider a Yogi to be higher than even a Gnani, even a Tapasvi. So he said, \"You become a Yogi, Arjuna.\" Arjuna asked, \"How do I become a Yogi?\"\n\nHe said, offer your mind and intellect to me, focus your mind and intellect on me, synchronize your mind and intellect with me, and you become a Yogi. Bhagavan has defined the perfect Bhakta as the one who offers his mind and intellect and considers him to be the supreme goal. Now here we discussed that Bhagavan, the supreme self which is pervading everywhere, is the same self that you consider yourself. Right now I consider myself to be identified with this body, mind, and intellect. Bhagavan said, when you tune your mind and intellect to me, align with me, and identify with me, you become my Bhakta.\n\nSo that's the definition of Bhakta we learn upfront in this chapter: Mayy arpita manobuddhih -- one who has offered his mind and intellect to me. Swamiji used to joke about it: in all our temples, the Bhagavans are standing there with the hand extended, hoping that some Bhakta will come someday and offer his mind and intellect. \"I'll fix it and give it back to him.\" But he says they're all unemployed, because no Bhakta ever goes to offer his mind and intellect.\n\nThey go and offer coconuts and flowers and prasad, but nobody is interested in giving their mind or intellect to Bhagavan. So Bhagavan has defined in this chapter: the devotee is the one whose mind is fixed on him and whose intellect is aligned with him.\n\nWe started this chapter with Arjuna's question about the two types of Bhaktas: one who considers God to be manifested in a particular form and worships him as his goal, and one who considers God to be Nirakara -- without any attributes, only all-pervading. Which one is better, which one is closer to him? And Bhagavan said, both are closer to me.\n\nBut for somebody who considers himself to be embodied, who identifies with his body as himself, it is very difficult to focus on God without any attributes. Therefore, it is much easier for you, Arjuna, to focus on someone or something you consider as the representation of the supreme reality. In this case, Bhagavan said, focus on me, Krishna, as the representation of the supreme reality -- see the entire divinity in that person. Swamiji explains: just as we assign our entire patriotic feelings to the flag of our country. When that flag is raised in the stadium during the Olympic medal ceremony, all citizens of that country feel elated because that flag represents their entire identification with their country.\n\nBhagavan said, in the same way, when you can see the entire supreme reality represented in one person or one form, then it is easier for you to worship through that one. Then Bhagavan has given us choices: if you cannot offer your mind and intellect to me, at least do Abhyasa, constant practice. There are two ways to interpret this. One is to constantly keep trying to offer your mind and intellect to Bhagavan. The other is to learn about the nature of God through the scriptures, so that you come to realize what the supreme reality is and then offer yourself to it. If even that is not possible, offer all your actions to me -- work for me.\n\nSurrender to me, and I'll take care of everything. It's like when you work for a large company. Whatever you do in your position, you're actually doing it for the company. When you go to a meeting with your client, you don't say \"I am such and such.\" You say, \"I represent such and such company.\" The entire power of that company is behind you.\n\nNobody knows better than me, because I used to work for large companies. The last firm I worked at had 2,100 people. So when I represented myself as from that firm, they obviously knew I represented a 2,100-person firm. When I left that firm and started my own, I had five people. When I'd say I'm NBG Architecture, first I'd have to explain what NBG Architecture is, who owns it, and how it came into existence. Then I'd say, \"I'm the same person you used to meet.\"\n\nBecause the power of that company is what you're representing. The larger the company, the more power you have behind you. So if you identify with this limited mind and intellect, you're projecting the limited power of this mind and intellect. But if you identify with that universal mind and intellect, then when you work in the world outside, you're projecting the power of the supreme. Bhagavan said, do all your actions for me. Consider me as your employer and then work in this world, and you will have the supreme power behind you to be successful in everything you do.\n\nIf even that is not possible, then give up the anxiety for the fruits of your actions. Karma Phala Tyaga -- that will give you peace instantaneously. All those other things may not give you peace instantaneously. But this one thing -- if you give up the anxiety for the fruits of actions -- will give you peace right away. Na Chirat -- immediately you will get this peace.\n\nSo therefore Bhagavan in the end said, Karma Phala Tyaga is the greatest devotion to me. In other words, you have given up the sense of ownership -- \"I am the doer\" and \"I control my destiny.\" Once you have given that up, all your anxiety will be gone and you will be aligned with me. The greatest devotee is the one who gives up the anxiety for the fruits of actions.\n\nIn the last few verses, from verse 13 onwards through verse 19, Bhagavan has been defining the perfect devotee, the perfect Bhakta.\n\nThese qualities described for the perfect devotee are no different than the Muni we saw in chapter two. The qualities are exactly the same, just presented in a different way. These are the very qualities for which Bhagavan considers such a person as his Bhakta. And Swamiji categorized these qualities into six categories. After every verse, Bhagavan says Sa me Priyah -- such a devotee is closer to me, is dear to me.\n\nWhen he says \"dear to me,\" Bhagavan is not being partial -- \"if you have this quality, I like you; if you don't, I don't like you.\" Rather, that person is identifying much more closely with the supreme. The qualities we have been seeing from verse 13 onward start with Adveshta Sarvabhutanam Maitrah Karunayevacha -- he does not hate anyone in this world. Now that is something we find very difficult, because we hate many things and many beings in this world. \"I hate cockroaches and I hate snakes.\"\n\nBhagavan said, you may not want to associate with them, you may want to stay away from them, but you do not hate them. It's not like Parashurama saying, \"I'm going to make this earth Nakshatri -- no Kshatriyas on this planet.\" You are not going to say, \"I'll make this earth without cockroaches\" -- because they have survived the longest. As we know, we will be gone, but they will still be there. Bhagavan said, one who does not hate anyone -- and then we have seen several more qualities.\n\nAnd then we come to the verse: Yasmat na udvijate Lokah. This is a very important verse. Lokat na udvijate cha yah -- one who is not disturbed by others, and who does not disturb the world outside. My behavior, my presence should not agitate others, nor should I be agitated by others.\n\nI used to work for a company.\n\nI had moved to Dallas from another company, WZMH. They gave me a project and said there was already a project manager, but they were looking for a replacement. So they gave me that project. I went to the first meeting and the contractor said, \"Neil, I'm glad that you are going to be the project manager now. The last project manager we had was a guy named Howard Johnson.\"\n\nHe said, \"He may not say anything, he may not do anything, but as he walks into the room, everybody gets tense and agitated. Something about the way he handled people -- it just didn't make people comfortable.\" The contractor told me, you shouldn't be that type of person. People should feel calm and comfortable in your presence.\n\nI remember another incident. My chief architect, where I was interning as a first-year architecture student, was the one who introduced me to Swami Chinmayananda.\n\nHe also took me to another saint, Sant Mota. He was somehow on a mission to introduce me to all great sages. I kept telling him, \"Padna, I have no interest in spirituality.\" But anyway, he introduced me to Sant Mota, who founded the Mauna Mandir. His concept was that you stay alone in a room for as long as you can.\n\nPeople would sign up for one day, two days, one week, one month. The condition was that you just go there and do whatever you want to do -- chant, read Bhagavad Gita, read even a novel if you want to. But you are not connected with the world outside. No phones, no newspapers. Take whatever books you want to take.\n\nBut other than that, you stay there. People used to come from all over the world to sign up for that Mauna Mandir. I'm not sure whether it's still there or not. But he was called Sant Mota, and when Padna took me to him, somebody asked Mota a question. I was only 17 years old. \"I hear all about some being fake sadhus and some being genuine teachers.\"\n\n\"How do we differentiate between a fake guru and a real guru?\" He said, \"What I say is very simple. If you come to that person and you feel peace in your mind, he is a true Sadhu. If in his presence you get agitated, consider him to be not right for you.\"\n\nI still remember that answer after all these years. It is such a profound statement. And I'll tell you what we experienced ourselves in the presence of Gurudev. No matter how many questions you had, no matter how you went thinking, \"I'm going to talk to Swamiji and tell him that these people are doing this to me\" -- you go there, and you forget everything. You forgot what you were going to complain about.\n\nPeople used to just sit in front of Swamiji for hours. Swamiji would keep doing whatever he was doing. He was actually watching tennis in those days -- Swamiji always liked to watch tennis because he was a tennis player. People would record all those Wimbledon matches, and when Swamiji was relaxing, he would watch tennis.\n\nWe will have like 15, 20 people just sitting there for hours without any words exchanged.",
      "reflection": "\"Anapekshah\"—free from expectations. This single quality from verse 16 strikes at the root of much human suffering. We have \"mortgaged our happiness,\" as the teaching says, to external conditions and other people. My children must perform well for me to be happy. My spouse must behave a certain way. My colleagues must recognize my worth. We have distributed the keys to our peace among countless others who may never use them as we wish. The true devotee, having identified with the inexhaustible Divine, becomes \"the reservoir of his happiness.\" This is not cold detachment but the deepest security—happiness that does not depend on the world's cooperation.\n\nVerse 17 describes one who \"neither laments nor desires\" (na socati na kankshati). This is freedom from the two movements that torment the mind: grief over the past and craving for the future. The devotee lives fully in the present moment, where the Divine actually dwells. Notice the phrase \"shubha-ashubha-parityagi\"—one who has renounced both good and bad fortune as defining experiences. This does not mean indifference to ethics but freedom from being psychologically tossed by favorable and unfavorable circumstances.\n\nVerse 18 points to equanimity toward \"friend and foe, honor and dishonor, heat and cold, pleasure and pain.\" Practice this today with one pair of opposites. Choose something you typically react to strongly—perhaps praise and criticism. When either comes, pause before the automatic reaction. Notice the mind wanting to expand with praise or contract with criticism. Can you remain \"samah\"—even—in both? This is not suppression but observation. The goal is not to stop feeling but to stop being unconsciously driven by feeling. At day's end, journal about what you noticed in these moments of attempted equanimity."

      ],
      "commentary": "What is my purpose and destiny? We've been discussing chapter 12, Bhakti Yoga. Devotion is love for the Divine. Love is nothing but identification. The more we identify with someone, the more we like that person.\n\nWhen identification becomes complete, we say we fell in love with that person. So Bhakti is nothing but the love for the Divine. Love cannot occur without knowledge of that person or knowledge of that thing. So in this case, loving God is not possible without knowing God. Knowledge is as important as my desire to love God. The knowledge about God, the knowledge about the Supreme Being, is what we had been learning from Bhagavan.\n\nIn the last five chapters, from chapter 7 through 11, Bhagavan elaborated the nature of the Supreme. In chapter seven he says, there is nothing greater than Me. And then he explains that everything you see is nothing but me -- the Prakriti you see is nothing but my lower Prakriti, my lower nature, the manifest Prakriti. So he has described his lower Prakriti as the manifest world which we see.\n\nWe complain that we have not seen Bhagavan. But Bhagavan said, you see me every day. You deal with me every day. You just do not know that you are dealing with Bhagavan, because there is nothing other than me in this world. Then he described many aspects of this Prakriti -- how we can identify his presence in Prakriti, which we saw in chapter 10, Vibhuti Yoga: anything excellent you see in this world, consider that to be my presence.\n\nI am the strength in the strong, the intelligence in the intellect, the fragrance in the flower. Everything that right now I consider to be something other than me -- Bhagavan said -- is me, the supreme alone. Right now, my identification is so complete with this limited self. I consider this body, mind, and intellect to be me.\n\nThis identity is so complete that loving myself is very easy. In spite of all my shortcomings that I am aware of, I never hate myself, because the identification is so complete that I'm in love with myself. But once again, the quest in life is to change this identification from this limited self to the supreme self. For that to happen, I obviously need to know Bhagavan. As we have seen in the last five chapters, Bhagavan has been telling us the nature of the supreme.\n\nIn chapter 11, just before this chapter, Bhagavan demonstrated that everything comes out of me and everything merges into me -- whether you consider it good, bad, or ugly. It's easy for us to associate divinity with something pristine and sattvic. But it's very difficult for our mind to associate divinity with something that doesn't align with us, that is not conducive to our comfort.\n\nTherefore, in this chapter, Bhagavan, while explaining Bhakti, describes the nature of the perfect devotee. From the beginning of this chapter we saw Arjuna's question: which is better? One who worships the manifest Prakriti, the manifest nature of God, or those who worship the supreme without any attributes?\n\nBecause in the end we have learned that he does not have any form. He is not a man, not a woman, not it, not she, not he -- he's everything. Without any form, it is very difficult for us to grasp his nature. That higher Prakriti, Bhagavan said, is very different from the manifest Prakriti which you see. But to focus on that higher Prakriti, my mind may not be capable. Bhagavan said, for those who consider themselves identified with this body -- the embodied ones who consider \"this is me\" --\n\nAs we said, our identity is so complete with this body, mind, and intellect. Nobody has to tell me \"this is me\" or \"that's me\" -- the rest is the world outside. For one who considers himself thus, to focus his mind on the unmanifest is very difficult. Klesha Adhikatarah Tesham -- for them the difficulty is much greater.\n\nSo for them it is easier to focus on one form that they find divine. Ramakrishna, or Gurudev Swami Chinmayananda -- in his presence, you don't have to figure out what God looks like. Many children in our neighborhood, when Gurudev came to our house, would say, \"God came to Bhatt's house.\" Because we easily associate divinity with such a person. Bhagavan said, this may be easier for you, Arjuna. At your level, the easiest way to worship me is to give your mind and intellect to me. In other words, synchronize your mind and intellect with me. As we discussed last time -- WWKD, What Would Krishna Do in this situation? Like the Christian bracelets that say WWJD.\n\nIt's for teenagers who are facing peer pressure -- should I smoke or not smoke? You say, think about it. Look at the bracelet: WWJD. What would Jesus do in this case? Synchronize your mind and intellect with me. Give your mind and intellect to me and make me the supreme goal.\n\nI'll take care of everything. If that is not possible, Bhagavan gives another option: constant practice or constant learning of the nature of the Lord from the scriptures. If that is not possible, give me all your actions -- work for me and do all your actions for me. My employer is Lord Krishna. Everything I do is for him.\n\nIf even that is not possible, then just do Karma Phala Tyaga -- don't expect anything from what you do. In the end he said, Karma Phala Tyaga is the greatest of all because it gives you peace instantaneously. As soon as you give up the anxiety for the fruits of actions, your mind will stop agitating. Most of my agitations are about the fruits -- fear of what will happen in the future.\n\nBhagavan said, once you give that up, peace will come automatically. Therefore it is greater than anything. So Bhakti is like an HOV lane on the highway. It takes you to your destination much quicker than other paths -- Karma Yoga, Gnana Yoga, Dhyana Yoga. Those are slower paths.\n\nThere are several entry points you can have. Either you are ready and give your mind to me. If you're not ready, keep practicing. If not, keep working for me. If not, just give up the fruits of actions and you will be my Bhakta. And then in the last few verses, starting from verse 13, we've seen the nature, the characteristics, the qualities of a perfect devotee.\n\nAll our preconceived notions about a bhakta -- that he has given up everything and is just doing nothing but bhajans all day long. And as Swamiji used to say, with those noisy accompaniments -- no, that's not bhakti. A Bhakta is the one who has these qualities. So Bhagavan has given the litmus test of who is a perfect devotee. And Swamiji enumerates 36 qualities of a perfect devotee, starting from Adveshta Sarvabhutanam Maitrah Karunayevacha. One who does not hate anyone.\n\nAs I said, it is so difficult for us to even have that concept, because so many things in this world we don't like. As long as you have identification with this body, mind, and intellect -- within the realm of this body, this mind, this intellect -- anything which is not conducive to the body, I'll hate. \"It's too hot, it's too cold\" -- because it's not conducive to my body. When I used to live in Nairobi, you didn't need air conditioning or heating.\n\nThe city by nature is perfectly air-conditioned -- the temperature remains between 65 and 75 all throughout the year. So I found that very conducive, a good city to live in. Until we found out that Meena and my son Neeraj both had asthma because of the high altitude. So for me it was very conducive.\n\nFor them it was completely not conducive. So Bhagavan says, as long as you identify with this body, mind, and intellect, there will be things that are mentally conducive and sometimes mentally not conducive, intellectually conducive and intellectually not conducive. But one who is not identified with these limitations -- for him it becomes possible to worship God without any form. A true Bhakta reaches that point.\n\nSo we have been seeing these qualities from the last few verses. Samah shatrau cha mitre cha tatha mana apamana yoh, shitoshna sukha duhkheshu samah sanga vivarjitah. One who no longer considers this body and intellect to be me, but rather my equipment. For him, his relationships are neutral in all aspects. Nobody is truly my friend and nobody is truly my foe. But there is a Vyavaharik (transactional) relationship I will have.\n\nThe people who help me are my friends. The people who hinder me are my enemies. But that's a Vyavaharik, transactional relationship. But at the core of my being, I remain equanimous to them. As long as I identify with my mind, there will be honor and dishonor.\n\nObviously, we architects put our buildings out for all to see. They say that doctors bury their mistakes; we put ours out for the world to see. The buildings I don't like, I avoid passing by. The ones I like, I make sure to pass by -- because at the intellectual level, honor and dishonor is what I perceive.\n\nBut you see, for the true Bhakta, both are equal. Shitoshna sukha duhkheshu -- at the body level, hot and cold. That does not mean I don't feel hot. Somebody asked Swamiji Gurudev, \"Why is it that you always go in the best car?\" Because people would go to pick up Swamiji at the airport.\n\nSomeone has a Mercedes or BMW or Lexus. There are people who have Toyotas. \"You don't go in those cars.\" Swamiji said, \"I'm not stupid. If the best car is available, which is more reliable and not going to break down on the way, why should I take a chance and go in an old Subaru that may break down on the highway?\"\n\nSo when it is available to me to mitigate discomfort at the body level, I will do it. But if it is not available, I persevere and continue. Shitoshna sukha duhkha -- Agamapayinah, Anityah -- they come and go. I remain constantly at peace because Samah Sanga Vivarjitah -- I remain constantly in a state of equanimity because I'm not attached to any of these worlds of mine.\n\nPhysical, mental, intellectual. Tulya ninda stutih mauni -- Tulya ninda stutih means equanimous to criticism and praise. Because no matter what you do, somebody will praise the same act and somebody will criticize that same act. The Supreme Court takes a decision on those abortion pills. Democrats are rejoicing -- \"They did the right thing.\"\n\nRepublicans are saying, \"What is this court doing?\" So Ninda and Stuti, criticism and praise -- both I consider to be not about my actions alone but a reflection of their mental environment. Somebody will like what I say because it is conducive to them. Somebody will criticize what I say because it is not conducive to them. Therefore, a true devotee of the Lord -- in other words, one who has identified himself with the supreme -- remains at peace in all situations. Mauni -- he becomes silent, not just physically or at the speech level.\n\nAt the mind level, I may be silent but fuming inside. And that's very dangerous. You can end up in trouble if you don't vocalize your anger, don't vocalize your ideas, don't vocalize what's going on in your mind. But this is silence at the mind level.\n\nWhen Mauni, the true devotee, becomes silent at the mind level -- that is true silence. Santushtah yena kenachit -- content with this or that, content with whatever comes.",
      "reflection": "These concluding verses of Chapter 12 offer the culminating portrait of the beloved devotee. \"Tulya-ninda-stutih\"—equal to censure and praise. The teaching observes that no matter what we do, some will praise and some will criticize. The same Supreme Court decision causes Democrats to rejoice and Republicans to despair. This recognition can liberate us from the exhausting effort to please everyone. The devotee understands that praise and blame reflect the mental state of others more than objective truth about ourselves. \"Mauni\"—one who has become silent, not merely at the level of speech but at the level of mind. This inner silence is the fruit of true devotion.\n\n\"Santushto yena kenacit\"—content with whatever comes. \"Aniketah\"—without a fixed abode. This does not mean homelessness but freedom from psychological dependence on any particular place, possession, or circumstance for one's sense of security. The devotee is at home everywhere because the Divine is everywhere. \"Sthira-matih\"—steady-minded. The mind that has found its anchor in the infinite does not sway with every passing wind of circumstance.\n\nThe final verse (20) brings it all together: those who pursue this \"dharmy-amritam\" (immortal righteousness) with \"shraddha\" (faith), making the Divine their supreme goal, are \"ativa me priyah\"—exceedingly dear to the Lord. Bhakti, we learn, is like an HOV lane on the highway of spiritual progress—it takes us faster to our destination than other paths. Today, choose one quality from these verses that feels most distant from your current state: Is it contentment? Silence of mind? Equanimity toward praise and blame? Freedom from fixed attachments? Do not judge yourself for the gap, but use it as a compass pointing toward growth. What one small step could you take today in that direction?"

      "commentary": "We concluded chapter 12, Bhakti Yoga, Yoga of Devotion. Now we'll be starting discussion on Chapter 13, the Kshetra Kshetrajna Vibhaga Yoga, Yoga of differentiation between the field and its knower. So far we have seen the two segments of the Bhagavad Gita which discussed \"tat\" and \"tvam\" from the Mahavakya Tattvamasi. The first six chapters we learned about \"tvam.\" The next six chapters we learned about \"tat.\" Now we will be discussing the correlative verb \"asi,\" the connections between the two and how to differentiate between the two. Therefore it's called Kshetra Kshetrajna Vibhaga Yoga, Yoga of the field and its knower.\n\nIn other words, how to differentiate between what I am not and what I am. There is a granth written by Bhagavan Shankaracharya, or at least attributed to him, called Drig Drishya Viveka, which is similar in nature but more logically explained. Drig Drishya Viveka -- discrimination between the seer and the seen. Who is the seer and what is seen? If we can differentiate, then we know them both. So the same way, here it says Kshetra Kshetrajna Vibhaga -- how to differentiate the field from its knower.\n\nSo that's the theme of this chapter. In other words, we will be learning how to navigate through Maya. Maya is the entity which creates this confusion for me, who I am and what is my real nature. Maya creates this illusion of plurality where the only singularity exists. One exists, but it appears to be many. So the chapter now discusses this aspect of Maya in detail.\n\nSwamiji explains here that in this chapter, suddenly after devotion, Krishna took up a theme which is completely different, and therefore some interpolator has added this one verse. The very first verse, Arjuna Uvacha, does not appear in previous commentators' commentaries. Bhagavan Shankaracharya did not comment on the first verse; he starts from the second verse. Same with Jnaneshwari -- it also starts from the second verse. Because it seemed like Bhagavan had suddenly taken up a different topic, somebody thought it appropriate to add a connector between what was discussed so far and what would be discussed next. What we will be discussing is actually the continuation of the theme.\n\nBhagavan started this theme in chapter seven and chapter eight. In chapter seven he talked about the Eightfold Lower Prakriti and the Manifest Prakriti. Then in chapter eight he talked about the imperishable Brahman. Chapters nine, ten, and eleven were somewhat of a distraction from the theme because Arjuna kept asking questions. He wanted to know in what different forms to think about Bhagavan, so Krishna gave the Vibhuti Yoga.\n\nThen he wanted to know Bhagavan in his totality, so Krishna gave him the Vishwarupadarshan. And then obviously it culminated in Bhakti Yoga. So Bhagavan picked up that theme again from chapters 7 and 8. In chapter 13, we want to continue the theme of how to differentiate between the Jiva and Paramatma and what is their connection. As we have learnt in that great statement: that which you are seeking, and you who consider who you are, are one and the same. But right now I don't see the connection.\n\nOnce I know the nature of both, then I will be able to connect them. So that's basically the theme of chapter 13, Kshetra Kshetrajna Vibhaga Yoga. The very first verse, Arjuna Uvacha, basically gives you what we're going to discuss in this chapter. As we've discussed many times, the best presentation is when you first tell them what you're going to talk about, then tell them what you are talking about, and then tell them what you told them.\n\nSummarize it, put an agenda up front, make the presentation, and then summarize. So here the first verse attributed to Arjuna says: Prakritim Purusham cha eva, Kshetram Kshetrajnam eva cha, etat veditum icchami, Jnanam Jneyam cha Keshava. These are the things I want to understand clearly. We pick up the themes from chapters 7 and 8. Prakritim Purusham -- I want to know Prakriti and Purusha. We have discussed these before; we need to brush up our knowledge of what Prakriti and Purusha are. And also Kshetra Kshetrajna, the field and its Knower. You talked about the field of my actions. This world currently is clear to me -- this is the field of my actions.\n\nFor me it is very simple. I am the actor and this world is the field of my actions. So I am the knower of the field of my actions. But when it comes to knowing who I am, I have to go further. So we will talk about that. Kshetram Kshetrajnam eva cha, etat veditum icchami, Jnanam Jneyam cha Keshava -- I also want to know what is knowledge and what is to be known.\n\nSo we clarified by this first verse what we'll be discussing. To know myself, I have to be very clear about what is Prakriti and what is Purusha, what is manifest and what is unmanifest. I also need to know what is the field of my activity and who is the actor. I also want to know what is knowledge and what is to be known. Just simple curiosity -- \"I want to know\" -- doesn't mean anything.\n\nI need to know what is there to be known. So Arjuna asked this question to put the agenda forward for this chapter, saying we want to know about these things.\n\nThe next verse is where it changes the paradigm for us. Idam shariram Kaunteya, Kshetram iti abhidhiyate -- this body, O Kaunteya, is called the field. Completely different than what I thought all along.\n\nWe thought that this world is the field, and I as this limited being am the knower of this world. I know my world, I know my field -- my field of profession, field of activity. So right now I have considered this body to be the knower, this me, this limited being, to be me. But Bhagavan said no, this body itself is the field. This field which I consider to be the world, and this body, mind, intellect which I consider to be me --\n\nHe said no, this body belongs to the field, the Prakriti. The knower is somebody different than that. This body is called the field. He who knows is called the Kshetrajna. One who knows this body is the Kshetrajna. Once I have established what the field is, the one who knows the field is the knower.\n\nSo from the perspective of the world, the \"I\" is the seer of this world. When I see colors and forms, my eye is the seer and the world is the seen. When it comes to my eye, the mind is the seer and the eye is the seen. When I observe what is happening to my eye, who is seeing? My mind is seeing my eye. So I took a step backward and put the seer in the field of the seen. And if I keep receding, then everything that I consider today to be me will belong to the field of Prakriti.\n\nThat which I consider to be me so far is my mind, my body, my intellect. That's what I define myself to be. But when seen from the perspective of what do I know, I know about my body. If I know my body, then I am the the knower. Somebody other than my body. Same goes for my mind.\n\nI'm very aware that my mind is upset. So I am the knower of my mind. My mind is not calm today. Somebody sees the mind to be not calm or calm -- there is some other entity which is seeing the mind. That same entity also can judge whether my intellect is sharp or dull.\n\nI don't know about it. So there is somebody other than this body, mind and intellect who is the knower. One who knows all these three. So in short, Bhagavan says the body is the field. The one who knows that is considered to be the knower. That's basically simple.\n\nBut because of my identification, I always considered this to be the seer. As I give the example that my eye can see but only with the aid of my glasses. So I consider the glasses to be as important as my eye. If I want to read without glasses, I cannot read. So glasses are as important for me to read as my eye is. But I don't consider my eye and glasses in the same category.\n\nBecause I know I can go to LensCrafters and get replacement glasses in one hour. The eye, at least today, is not that easy to replace. Someday it will probably be as simple. Till that time, I consider the eye to be something very special -- part of me without which I cannot see. But glasses I can replace.\n\nBut if I can now learn that even the eye can be replaced anytime, then I will also put the eye in the same category as my glasses. Sometimes the instruments through which we see, we identify with so closely that we forget the differentiation between the seer and the seen. So Bhagavan changes this paradigm and says this body is the field through which the seer is functioning to manifest.\n\nElectricity needs all these lamps and gadgets. Electricity is present in this room -- we can vouch for it because the lights are on, the air conditioning is on.\n\nBut remove both the air conditioning and the light, and we will not know whether electricity is in the room or not -- until you put a finger in that outlet. So the seer is present, but its presence is felt through the equipment. The knower is only there as long as the knowables are there. If there's nothing to be known, the knower is not needed. The proverbial question -- whether a tree falling in the jungle makes a sound or not -- unless there's somebody to listen to that sound, the world of sound does not exist.\n\nAnd unless there are objects, no knower can exist. In my deep sleep, there is no knower because the world does not exist for me. Therefore there is no knower. If there are no knowables, the knower does not exist. So if you remove the knowables from the knower, Bhagavan says, what remains is pure knowledge -- not knowledge of something, but knowledge by itself, which we call pure awareness.\n\nRight now I exist as something. Then everything else follows -- as Neel, as an architect, as a father, as a community member, whatever it is. But I have to attach something to \"I exist.\" And if you remove all of them, what remains is simply \"I exist.\" So the knower and the known go together.\n\nSo it says, idam shariram Kaunteya, Kshetram iti abhidhiyate. This body is to be known as the field, and the one who knows the body is the knower of the field. Now these are the arguments for us to navigate through Maya so that you can contemplate on the nature of the self. You can start to contemplate: okay, if this body is not me, who knows this body?\n\nThe next verse says, Kshetrajnam cha api mam viddhi, sarva-kshetreshu Bharata. Once we have discussed that this body is the field and the knower is the Kshetrajna, then we may have another confusion -- that in my body I am the field and my consciousness is the knower.\n\nIn your body, the same thing for you. There are so many knowers in this world, as many beings are there that many knowers are there from our perspective from just learning the second verse. So Bhagavan clarifies this.",
      "reflection": "These opening verses introduce the revolutionary insight that \"idam shariram\" - this very body - is the field (kshetra), not just the external world. Krishna declares that there is only one Knower (kshetrajna) in all fields. Today, contemplate this paradigm shift: you have always considered your body, mind, and intellect to be \"you\" - the knower. But what if they belong to the field of the known? Spend a few moments simply observing your body sensations, your thoughts, your emotional reactions. Notice that there is something aware of all these - that awareness itself is the true Knower.\n\nThe verse states \"kshetra-kshetrajnayor jnanam yat taj jnanam matam mama\" - the knowledge of both field and Knower is true wisdom. This week, practice asking yourself throughout the day: \"Who is aware of this experience right now?\" When you notice your breath, who notices? When you feel an emotion, who feels aware of that feeling? This inquiry is the beginning of navigating through Maya - the confusion between what you are not and what you truly are.\n\nAs a practical exercise, sit quietly for five minutes each morning. Let your attention rest on the simple sense of \"I exist\" before any thought of being a particular person with particular roles. Can you touch that pure sense of existence-awareness before the mind adds labels? This is the doorway to understanding the Knower of the field."

      "commentary": "We have started discussing chapter 13, Kshetra Kshetrajna Vibhaga Yoga, Yoga of knowing the difference between the field and its knower. We are basically learning how to navigate through Maya. As we have seen before, we have four great Vedas: Rig, Sama, Yajur, and Atharva. Each one gave us one great statement which summarizes the entire philosophy of who I am. At the end of the Vedas is a section called Vedanta, literally \"end of Vedas,\" which consists of the Upanishads. The Upanishads discuss who we are, what our relationship is to that Almighty, and whether I have an existence before and after my death. Each one has argued this point logically and came to a logical conclusion about what the truth is, summarized in one great statement in each Veda.\n\nSo in Rugveda from Ayutary Upanishad, we get Prajnaam Brahman. In the end, he says, the real truth is that the consciousness alone is that Almighty, all pervading self. From this Sama Veda in Chandogya Upanishad came Tattvamasi, that thou art, you are that that which you are seeking as the Supreme Lord is your own self. From the Atharva Veda came I am Atma Brahman. After the inquiry about what the self is, it says, my self is Brahman. The self which I consider to be myself is Brahman.\n\nSo that comes from the Atharva Veda's Mandukya Upanishad. The last one is Aham Brahmasmi, \"I am Brahman.\" The final realization that Brahman is none other than my own self comes from the Yajurveda, from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. The Gita, as we have seen, is Bhagavan Krishna's collection of all those ideas from the Upanishads, put into one discourse called the Bhagavad Gita. So we have been discussing the Bhagavad Gita, learning the essence of these great statements.\n\nMany commentators have said, as we have discussed many times before, that Tattvamasi is the statement which the Gita elaborates upon. We have learned so far about \"tat\" and \"tvam\" in the first 12 chapters. For six chapters we learned about \"tvam,\" that is, you and I as limited beings. That segment culminated in Dhyana Yoga, Yoga of Meditation. Once I know who I am as a limited being, now I have to contemplate upon who I am.\n\nThe next six chapters we discussed about that, that Almighty, the Supreme. What is the nature of that? And that culminated into Bhakti Yoga, Yoga of devotion. Once I know myself in that Almighty, I will have nothing but devotion for that self. Once I identify with someone, I will be in love with that person. I love something when I know something.\n\nOnce I know the nature of the Supreme, then only can I develop devotion for it. So chapter 12 was Bhakti Yoga, Yoga of Devotion. Chapter 13 now connects the two. \"That thou art\" -- that correlative verb \"art\" is what we are now discussing: how to make the connection between this limited self which I consider to be myself, and that which is the Almighty, all-pervading. As we have discussed in Self Unfoldment and before, this self which I consider \"me\" is a conditioned self, conditioned in my body. And I consider this to be my body.\n\nThis is a gross body which I consider to be my body which is perceived by everybody else. Everybody can see how tall I am, how short I am, how old I am. But then there is a subtle body which I am very aware. You may have inkling about it, but you can't perceive it. That's my mind and intellect. That's like a software in this hardware called body.\n\nBut both of these exist because of the third body, called the causal body, which is the cause for these two to come into existence. These two cannot come into existence if there is no cause for them. These two came into existence as they are. Why are you not so powerful? Why are you not so smart? That's because this is what the cause considered the most appropriate form to transact all the desires and vasanas which I have. So that's the causal body.\n\nThe causal body is nothing but the leftover tendencies and vasanas from my past experiences. For example, from my past experience of buying a house in this area -- if I made a mistake last time, don't do that again. Next time when I buy a house, I look for a good school district because that's more important. Let's find which has the best resale value. Don't fall into the trap of \"this is the most economical area.\"\n\nYou need to find something where the resale value is more important. All these are my past impressions from last time, when I made a mistake. The same way, Bhagavan says that this body and this mind are also ordered by me, custom designed by me. Like when you go online and fill out which color car you want, what shape, what size, what brand, and you put together a customized package. I heard somewhere that at Starbucks, there are like 5,400 or so different varieties of coffee you can order -- you can customize your coffee. It's the same way I have customized this existence of mine which I call my limited self.\n\nTotal impressions of my past experiences and tendencies created these two bodies. Subtle body and gross body. That's at my micro level. The total tendencies and impressions of all the beings and things in this Jagat, this universe create the total causal body. And in Sankhya philosophy it's called Mola Prakriti. The original nature of this Prakriti, Mula Prakriti.\n\nIn Vedanta, we call it Maya. That means \"ya ma sa maya\" -- that which is not, but appears to be, that is Maya. These limitations on me -- as my body, my mind, my intellect -- are not actually there. There are no limitations on myself apart from my mind, my intellect, my body. But it appears to have this limitation.\n\nI feel these limitations when I think about myself. That's because of Maya. Maya is nothing but my identification with this body, with this mind, with this intellect. As long as that identification is there, all the limitations of my body, mind, and intellect will be there. Once I get out of that identification, those limitations only remain for the body, for the mind, for the intellect -- but not for me. Swami Vivekananda used to say, \"I as a Swami have all the problems.\"\n\n\"But I as I have no problem.\" I as an architect have all the problems, all limitations. But when I remove all those, the \"I\" which remains has no problem because it has no limitation. How to migrate from this limited \"I\" and its identification to that unlimited \"I\" -- that is what we'll be discussing from chapter 13 through 18. And therefore the last chapter, chapter 18, will culminate in Moksha Sannyasa Yoga, Yoga of liberation and renunciation.\n\nSo we started discussing chapter 13. We have indicated that the very first verse, Arjuna Uvacha, is not in many texts, but it is very appropriate that it was interpolated by some commentator. Arjuna said, \"I want to know the nature of these things.\" What are the things he wants to know? Prakriti -- I want to know the nature of Prakriti.\n\nI want to know the nature of Purusha also. In addition, I want to know Kshetra and Kshetrajna -- what is the field and who is the knower of the field. I want to know what is knowledge and what is to be known. So these are the topics we'll be discussing going forward. Somebody put it in Arjuna's mouth so that we know we'll be talking about Purusha and Prakriti, Kshetra and Kshetrajna, Jnanam and Jneyam.\n\nIf I can differentiate between these two -- what is Kshetra and Kshetrajna, what is Purusha and Prakriti, what is knowledge and what is to be known -- then I have accomplished my task. From the next verse, Bhagavan basically changes the paradigm for us. Up till now, I considered the \"I\" to be the knower and the world to be the field of my actions.\n\nSo I've included in the \"I\" the knower -- my body, my mind, my intellect is the knower part. \"Neel, do you know this?\" When I say \"I know it,\" I mean my mind, my intellect, my body are all included in it. But once I know: Idam Shariram Kaunteya, Kshetram iti abhidhiyate. You want to know what the field is?\n\nThis body is the field. One who knows this field is the knower of the field. So this body is the field of activities for the consciousness to function through. It is not \"I\" -- this is the field. In this field, all the activities take place. This field is nothing but part of the Prakriti.\n\nI have borrowed from the Prakriti this body. All the food which I have eaten from the day of my birth till this morning's breakfast is my body. So I actually borrowed from outside. Bhagavan said this is the field. One who knows this field -- say, \"I am aware of my body,\" \"I'm aware my leg is broken\" --\n\n\"I'm aware I'm short,\" \"I'm aware I'm tall.\" That entity which is aware of the limitations or the qualities of the body, Bhagavan said, is the knower. So he defines what is Kshetra and Kshetrajna. But he included this body in the field. Body is part of the Prakriti; so is mind; so is intellect. They do not belong to me.\n\nThey are the equipment borrowed from this Prakriti, and I use them. Then: Kshetrajnam cha api mam viddhi, sarva-kshetreshu Bharata. \"I, the knower of this body, am a very distinct individual.\" You, the knower of your body; she, the knower of her body. Bhagavan says no -- there is only one knower. He knows all the bodies.\n\nAll the fields of actions are known by only one entity. Bhagavan says, \"That's me.\" The Kshetrajna is only one. The Kshetra may be many; the fields of activities may be many. But the knower and the actor is only one. Be clear that I'm the only knower in this world.\n\nI, the all-pervading self, am the only knower. Then the next verse, verse 4, says: Tat kshetram yat cha yadrik cha, yad-vikari yatah cha yat, tat samasena me shrinu. Once again he told us what we are going to discuss, then we'll discuss it, and in the end we'll say, \"This is what we discussed.\" So this is what we're going to discuss: What is the field and what is its nature?\n\nWhat are its modifications? Because sometimes we don't recognize the thing which gets modified. We may know it's in a raw form but when modified we don't recognize. So you should also know the modification of Bhagavan and when it is and also who it is and what his powers are. So he basically said we'll be discussing this. What is the nature of the field?\n\nWhat are its modifications, where it is, how it functions, what are the field's powers? So we are talking about Maya -- what Maya's powers are, how it deludes you into thinking you are what you are not. Bhagavan said, \"I'll be telling you briefly, so please listen.\" Rishibhih bahudha gitam, chandobhih vividhaih prithak, Brahma-sutra-padaih cha eva, hetumadbhih vinishchitaih. Even Bhagavan Krishna says, \"I cannot say that this is my own idea.\"\n\nIn our culture, there is nothing called an original idea. Even Bhagavan cannot say, \"This is my idea.\" It has to be validated by many seers before you, and many people must have attested that this is the truth. Then only is that truth validated. Ours is a Veda-bound culture. We have to have proof in the Vedas for the idea which we are propagating or promoting.\n\nHas to have proof in Vedas. So Bhagavan Krishna said, I'm not going to tell you anything new. Rishibhih bahudha gitam -- the seers before me have already sung this truth in many ways.",
      "reflection": "These verses enumerate the 24 constituents of the field: the five great elements (earth, water, fire, air, ether), the ego (ahamkara), intellect (buddhi), the unmanifest (avyaktam), the ten sense organs, the mind, and the five sense objects. Krishna emphasizes that this teaching is not new - it has been sung by seers in various hymns and validated through the Brahma Sutras. Today, take inventory of what you normally consider \"yourself.\" Your physical body made of elements, your sense of individual identity, your reasoning faculty, your perceptions - all these belong to the field, not to the Knower.\n\nReflect on how you have \"customized\" your existence through past impressions and tendencies (vasanas). Like ordering a custom car with specific features, your body, mind, and intellect have been shaped by accumulated experiences. This is not cause for guilt but for understanding - these are borrowed equipment from Prakriti. The question becomes: if all this is borrowed, who is the borrower? Spend time today noticing how you identify with your personality traits, your intellectual capabilities, your physical characteristics. Can you see them as equipment rather than essence?\n\nAs a daily practice, when you wake up tomorrow, before getting out of bed, mentally list the components of your \"field\": your body lying there, your mind starting to generate thoughts, your intellect planning the day. Then ask: \"Who is aware of this entire field awakening?\" Rest in that awareness for a moment before beginning your day."

      "reflection": "Verse 7 completes the description of the field by including its subtlest modifications: desire (iccha), aversion (dvesha), pleasure (sukham), pain (dukham), the aggregate body (sanghata), consciousness reflected in matter (chetana), and fortitude (dhriti). Notice how even your desires and aversions belong to the field - they are experiences happening within you, not the essence of who you are. Today, when desire arises for something pleasant or aversion arises toward something unpleasant, practice labeling it: \"This is a modification of the field.\" You are the witness of these movements, not their slave.\n\nVerses 8-9 begin listing the twenty qualities that constitute true knowledge (jnana): humility (amanitvam), unpretentiousness (adambhitvam), non-violence (ahimsa), forgiveness (kshanti), uprightness (arjavam), service to the teacher (acharya-upasanam), purity (shaucham), steadfastness (sthairyam), self-control (atma-vinigrahah), dispassion toward sense objects (vairagyam), absence of egoism (anahamkara), and seeing the defects in birth, death, old age, and disease. These are not mere moral prescriptions - they are the natural qualities that emerge when one begins to dis-identify from the field. Which of these qualities do you find easiest to cultivate? Which most challenging?\n\nThis week, choose one quality from this list to consciously practice. If you choose humility, notice whenever the ego seeks recognition. If you choose non-violence, observe subtle forms of aggression in thought and speech. Keep a small journal noting when you succeeded and when you forgot. This is the practical work of knowledge."

      "commentary": "We have been discussing chapter 13. First we saw the definition of the Kshetra. The Kshetra is defined as everything that I can see, perceive, and think -- that is my field. The knower is the next subject of discussion. In the last few verses, we have been seeing the qualities of a seeker who wants to know. These qualities need to develop, or will develop, in the seeker because of his Mumukshutva, his desire to liberate himself from this limitation. All the qualities we are seeing are attributes which become the cause for that revelation. The last quality we saw was Putra-dara-griha-adishu.\n\nOne should be non-attached, not identifying with the putra, dara, griha, and so on. That which we commonly consider as something I need to be attached to, something I need to be identified with -- here Bhagavan says you should not be identified with it. Nityam cha sama-chittatvam ishta-anishta-upapattishu -- one becomes equanimous in all situations, whether ishta or anishta, whether conducive or non-conducive. In other words, we have been given a pointer: because we have defined the Kshetra as that which I can perceive, and the Kshetrajna as that which is not the field but the knower. Right now, my identification with my family and my possessions creates this notion that they are part of me. Therefore, the prescription here is: you need to develop non-identification.\n\nIt did not say \"do not have a relationship with them.\" They are my relationships. Putra, dara, griha -- all these are my relationships, my possessions, my acquisitions, my achievements. All these I should see as something other than me. With my identification remaining with the Self, I can now relate to them.\n\nThat right relationship forms the right sort of dharma for the relationship. I follow that dharma without identifying myself with it -- that is basically the prescription. And therefore it will remain the same all the time, because you realize these are my relationships, and relationships are constantly changing. No matter what the situation is, I remain constant in my identification and see the relationship developing and changing.\n\nSometimes the situation may be ishta -- something which I think is conducive to me. And sometimes it is not. When children come to us, we consider that as ishta. But when they want to move away from you, we don't consider that ishta.\n\nBut knowing that it is for their own good, we feel good about letting them go. If I have not understood the concept that I need to let the children go for their own good, I will be in the path of their progress. That close identification may cause a person not to achieve his or her full potential. So non-identification is very necessary. Bhagavan says, whether the condition is ishta or anishta, conducive or non-conducive, remain equanimous.\n\nThen we continued into a few more qualities which Bhagavan says are very essential to understand the nature of the knower. Who is it that is perceiving? \"Me\" is this mind and intellect, and then the ego it creates. The prescription here is given because, if I have developed the other qualities we discussed, then as Swamiji says, you have conserved lots of energy -- mental energy, intellectual energy. Now you have to apply that somewhere, so that it has its own field of action.\n\nSo the next verse is: Mayi cha ananya-yogena, bhaktih avyabhicharini. I take all this identification I have right now in this world -- which grounds my personality, grounds my self-esteem, grounds my identity about who I am. You take all this away from me, and I forget I'm an architect.\n\nI forget I have a house, and I'm nothing. My grounding in this world is because of my identification with my family, my friends, my organizations, my accomplishments, my profession. Now, up till now you heard that -- take all that away from you. Where can all that energy which I had been putting into identification go? Bhagavan says: Mayi cha, ananya-yogena.\n\nYou now shift all that identification to Me. There, I have an identification. Here, I have a relationship. Previously I thought my identification is my relationship, and my relationship is my identification. Because I identify, I have a relationship.\n\nTake the identification part and assign it to Me. Just leave the relationship. So Ananya means \"none other.\" Identification with none other -- and then relating to the world as the field of your activity, the field of your actions, the field of performing your duties. Bhagavan says this will relieve you from that burden. Bhaktih avyabhicharini -- devotion, love for the divine.\n\nWe talked about taking this identification. And assigning to the one supreme entity. Who I consider my own self. Which is other than this body, this mind, this intellect. Everything that I know right now is not that. Move all that identification to that.\n\nAnd it should be Ananya -- no other identification lingers around. Somebody says, \"Are you faithful to your wife?\" \"I'm very faithful, except that I have a couple of love affairs.\" Is he really faithful? The very fact that you have other affairs means you are not faithful.\n\nBut people do convince themselves that they are faithful because they are \"taking care of things.\" Bhagavan said that kind of identification with Me will not be very helpful. Therefore, bhakti avyabhicharini. Vyabhichari, in our normal context, refers to someone doing something which is disloyal to his own relationship or his own duties.\n\nWe do that to gain something frivolous. We perform that act for a momentary pleasure -- no real relationship, but just to get some pleasure for the time being. That is called vyabhichara.\n\nWe can relate that to our identification with the Supreme. \"Are you devoted to Bhagavan?\" \"I am very devoted to God. However, this is very important to me. This relationship is very important. Well, first is my wife and then my Bhagavan.\"\n\nYour bhakti should be avyabhicharini -- for no small gain will you shift your identification even for a moment to something other than Me. You'll be constantly identified with Me, and then functioning in this world. We have seen Swamiji's standard example of an actor performing his part on the stage. He's never truly identified with the role.\n\nHe's truly identified with himself, knowing fully who he is. He's performing his role very effectively -- that's the only reason he can perform his role effectively. Because he knows he is not the beggar that he is playing; he has a house in Beverly Hills.\n\nTherefore he can act the beggar so effectively. If he forgets he is an actor who is a multimillionaire, he will not be able to perform that act. So Bhagavan said you will be more effective in your relationships. Your bhakti with Me should be avyabhicharini -- never leaving that for small, petty gains.\n\nWe identify with things for our small pleasure, small gain in this world, and Bhagavan said that's what prevents you from realizing yourself. Mayi cha ananya-yogena. Swamiji says this is like a new word coined by Krishna in Bhagavad Gita: Ananya Yoga. Nowhere in the earlier scriptures does the word Ananya Yoga appear. But Krishna, in rejuvenating this whole knowledge, is coining new words. Ananya Yoga -- union with none other.\n\nMy union with Him is so firm that there is no other identification. Vivikta-desha-sevitvam. So now, if I am the only one in this room, am I by myself? Am I in solitude or in company? Well, of course, Neel, you're in solitude because there's nobody else here. He said, vivikta-desha-sevitvam.\n\nI should be practicing to be in solitude, not loneliness. As Swamiji points out, you don't want to be lonely -- you want to be in solitude. So everybody said, \"Well, that means what I had been thinking all along -- this is not going to work. I want to work my profession, have family, friends, all that, and then I'm trying to understand Bhagavad Gita.\"\n\nBhagavad Gita itself says go into solitude, then only you will know. Bhagavan said, not really. Solitude is when I identify with that Self that alone exists. Then nothing exists other than that. I am never really in another's company. Everything else is nothing but my own manifestation.\n\nEverything else is nothing but my own Leela. Then obviously I'm in complete solitude. When I'm here by myself, everything I do is just me. I say something, I hear that. But it's solitude because it's all me. That's why I said, in Surat when I was growing up, there was a Maun Mandir for a saint.\n\nIn the Maun Mandir, you don't even have to take Bhagavan's name when you go there. You just go into that room -- Maun Mandir, they called it -- and do whatever you want. You can take the books of your profession and read them.\n\nYou can take a radio or you can take anything -- there are no conditions. But you can take books, any type of books, and you can read there. The point is, you are by yourself. Whatever I do is echoing my own thoughts, echoing my own self. I'm in complete solitude because I'm identifying with nothing other than me alone. That sense of being, establishing yourself in it, creates this solitude.\n\nThe world is going around me, but it's like a dream, and therefore I'm in complete solitude. Vivikta-desha-sevitvam, aratih janasamsadi -- and he develops a distaste for the company of other people. Obviously, once I'm identified with Him, I see everything else is just a temporary relationship. So I will not be craving for their company; I'll be craving to be in my own Self. I may have relationships and therefore duties to perform.\n\nI get together with them, I talk to them, but I'm always in my solitude. I'm not craving for their company because my identification is gone. What do we really crave for? We identify with someone and say, \"I really need to go and see my mom,\" or \"I need to go and see such and such,\" only because we have an identification. Once the identification is shifted from this field to the knower of the field, obviously there is no craving for this field. So Bhagavan continues.\n\nNow he says, what is the purpose of all these things? Adhyatma-jnana-nityatvam, Tattva-jnana-artha-darshanam. For the purpose of knowing the Tattva, that knowledge which I am seeking. As we say, my true nature is Sat, Chit, and Ananda. The Chit is seeking the knowledge. But right now it is gaining knowledge which is actually in my way. To know my true knowledge, I need to do all that which is prescribed in these few verses.\n\nNow I will build a Tattva-jnana-artha-darshanam. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. I can see what my goal is. Swamiji explained that even when we go to the station and ask, \"Which is the train to Madras?\" -- that's because the train is not in Madras right now, but it is going to Madras. So right now I may not be there, but I see the goal for my being, where my identification will be established.\n\nThat's why Tattva-jnana-artha-darshanam -- I will know the essence of the knowledge about me. Adhyatma-jnana-nityatvam -- constancy of Self-knowledge. See, in our case we get a glimpse of who I am, but then we constantly shift and identify with something else which is also temporary. At no time do we have a constancy of identification about who I am, what I am.\n\nAt some point I thought I'm a very good student. At some point I thought, well, I'm a very good worker. My identification keeps shifting to different roles and accomplishments, never constant.",
      "reflection": "These verses complete the enumeration of knowledge with profound instructions: non-attachment to family and possessions (asakti), equanimity in favorable and unfavorable circumstances (sama-chittatvam), unswerving devotion to the Lord (ananya-yoga bhakti), love of solitude (vivikta-desha-sevitvam), and constant pursuit of Self-knowledge (adhyatma-jnana-nityatvam). The key teaching here is the difference between relationship and identification. Krishna does not ask you to abandon your family (putra, dara, griha) but to stop identifying with them. Your spouse, children, and home are relationships to be honored through dharma - but your sense of self should not depend on them.\n\nThe concept of \"ananya-yoga\" - union with none other - is revolutionary. Right now, your identity is scattered across many identifications: profession, family, achievements, possessions. What if all that energy of identification were gathered and redirected toward the Supreme? This is not abandonment of worldly duties but a shift in where you anchor your sense of self. Reflect today: what would your life look like if you maintained all your relationships and responsibilities, but your fundamental identity rested in the unchanging Self rather than changing circumstances?\n\nVerse 12 declares: \"This is knowledge; whatever is contrary to this is ignorance.\" As a practice, examine your mental and emotional reactions today. When you feel disturbed, ask: \"Which quality of knowledge am I forgetting right now? Am I attached when I should be witnessing? Am I craving company when I could rest in inner solitude?\" This discrimination between knowledge and ignorance is itself the path."

      "commentary": "We have been discussing chapter 13, Kshetra Kshetrajna Vibhaga Yoga, Yoga of differentiation between the field and its knower. The quest in our life is to know: is there an entity which knows that I exist? I know I exist as this body because of identification with this body. I exist as my mind and I exist as my intellect. But is there existence beyond this existence of body, mind, and intellect? That's the quest in our life, which is what we call immortality.\n\nAfter this body is destroyed, mind is destroyed, intellect is destroyed, will there be existence? We have been learning from Bhagavan. From chapters one through twelve, we have learned that yes, there is something which remains in existence even when these three are not existent. That we called our Supreme Self. And this we call a limited self. Through all of it, we have learned one thing and one thing alone.\n\nBhagavan continues to say that no matter which way you look at it, it is My existence alone. Even this limited existence is none other than My own existence. Everything which you see is nothing but Me alone. In chapter 10, Vibhuti Yoga, the Divine Glories, Bhagavan said that everything you see in this world is Me, but My presence can only be felt in perfection. Everybody can be a singer, but I only recognize the good singing. When somebody is singing in perfect shruti, that's when I enjoy the music.\n\nBhagavan said, that's where you will recognize My presence. But in the same chapter he came back and said that all these qualities which are contradictory to each other that you see in this world -- they're all Mine. It is not that I am in fear but not in fearlessness. In chapter 10, verses 4 and 5, he defined: Buddhi, Jnana, Asammoha, Kshama, Satyam, Dama, Shamah, Sukham, Dukham, Bhava, Abhava, Bhaya, Abhaya -- they all contradict each other. Ahimsa, Samata, Tushti, Tapa, Dana, Yashah, Ayashah -- bhavanti bhava bhutanam matta eva prithagvidhah. They manifest in people in different ways.\n\nBut they're all my qualities. I am the efficient cause. And all the qualities and things and beings which you see are the effects. Depending on the equipment, the effect may be different. We have been discussing this classical example of electricity involved. Depending on the bulb, the manifestation will be different.\n\nBut all the manifestations are of the same source. We have been learning that everything which I see -- the hunted and the hunter -- both are expressions of the same entity. But he said, not only the hunter and the hunted. The savior of the hunted from the hunter is also Me. The hunter is exhibiting the lower qualities; the savior is exhibiting the higher qualities. That is the only difference.\n\nThere is none that is not Me. We want to divide our world into divine and devilish -- this is good, this is bad. But He continues to tell us that that's not the case. The world, as you see it, is My own expression. So in chapter 13, we are going a step further.\n\nIn chapter 10 he said all qualities are Mine -- Yasha, Apayasha, fear, fearlessness. Now he says there is a difference between the two, which is what this chapter is all about. Kshetra, Kshetrajna. The field is this Jagat, the world of my experiences.\n\nAnd there we included everything that we know -- my body, my mind, my intellect, Idam Shariram. The 24 expressions of Prakriti that he included in Idam Shariram. Then he describes the modifications of them, the modification-expressions as we experience them. All these are expressions of the field with the vikaras. Vikaras are the modifications -- elements in their own form.\n\nWhen they come together with each other -- all these 24, which are seen as 10 senses, five sense objects, mind, intellect, buddhi, and five great elements -- when they interact with each other, what comes out are the vikaras, the modifications which we experience. They are part of this field.\n\nThey are inherent in the field and cannot be avoided. As that famous Gujarati poem says: Sukha-Dukha mana mein nahin, ghata satya gadhiya. They are embodied in the field itself -- the very expression of the self that cannot be avoided. As long as we are part of this world, they will be there. But then it says you can recognize the knower who is distinctly different from the field.\n\nWe have seen these 20 qualities which are the qualities of the Knower. As we saw previously, there are divine qualities and devilish qualities. The divine ones express the higher self; the others express the lower self. But both belong to the same Supreme Being. Here we are going a little further in our analysis to ask: what is it that makes me unhappy? He said, that's part of the Prakriti.\n\nAs long as I am bound by this Prakriti -- in other words, as long as I'm identified with this body, this mind, this intellect -- these are bound to occur. It cannot be avoided no matter how hard you try. We have all these mitigating plans. Invest in your 401(k)s. Well, no, put it in mutual funds. Then no, put some in bonds. Eventually we realized that there was no really foolproof formula.\n\nNo matter what you do, you are going to lose somewhere and win somewhere, as long as you keep an equal mind. That's what they say about monthly contributions -- even-mindedly, no matter where the market is, you put your 401(k) in. As long as you have that discipline.\n\nIn the end, you will be the winner. Bhagavan says the same thing: even-mindedly, you keep doing your work, no matter what the circumstances are. Then you will be the winner. In the end, you will be okay.\n\nSo we have seen these qualities of the field, and now we know what the field is. The Knower we have defined by 20 qualities. These qualities can be considered as prerequisites to recognize the Self. On the other hand, these are actually the qualities of the Knower himself. When the Knower is shining through you, all these qualities which we have been learning for the last few weeks will be exhibited.\n\nWhen you see these qualities, recognize that this is the manifestation of the Knower who is distinctly different from the field. Attachment is created by Prakriti. But detachment is created by the Knower. Therefore, all of us who came here -- our parents were too attached to us as children. But they gladly, even though they were sad that we were going to leave their home, let us come.\n\nProbably they knew we would never go back, and we would probably not write to them on a monthly basis. But their true love for you, which is the expression of the Knower, overcame attachment which wants to keep you with them. \"Let him make his own progress as an individual.\" So these qualities we have been looking at are the Knower's qualities. One set binds you to this Prakriti; the other liberates you from this Prakriti. But the field is no different than the Knower.\n\nField is also my expression. And in verse 12 we saw Etaj jnanam iti proktam -- \"This is what is called knowledge.\" In the end he defined knowledge as Adhyatma jnana nityatvam -- constant awareness about the Self. Being constantly aware that I am not this limited being.\n\nThis limited being is an instrument through which I function. The knower is defined by two qualities: Adhyatma jnana nityatvam and Tattvajnana-artha-darshanam. These are the two basic definitions we came across here. Tattvajnana-artha-darshanam means keeping the goal in mind -- why do I really want to know the truth? The goal should be clear in my mind.\n\nUnless I have a goal in mind, I won't have the enthusiasm. It is like if I am working hard all year, I need to have some goal. What am I going to achieve at the end of the year? Well, when my review comes, maybe my supervisor will recognize I have been working hard. You need to have a goal, the end game, so that you have enthusiasm to pursue the path. So if I consider all these 20 qualities as my prerequisites and want to develop them, I need to have a goal in mind. And the more clear I have the goal in mind, the easier it becomes.\n\nThese qualities will then manifest by themselves because my goal is now the correct goal. This is called knowledge. Bhagavan said, everything contrary to that is Ajnanam -- ignorance. Everything contrary to these qualities is ignorance about my own self. He told us: Yaj jnatva amritam asnute -- having known this knowledge, you will attain immortality.\n\nBecause the mortality is in reference to this body, this mind, this intellect. As long as I am not identified with them, those mortalities are not mine. Body and mind have their mortality. They are my equipment, and they will have their own use. And once their use is complete, I will have no use for them.\n\nThe immortality I seek is beyond this mortal being. Having known which you will attain that immortal Brahman: Anadi mat-param Brahma na sat tan nasat ucyate. So we want to be immortal. He said no, that doesn't happen that way. No being can be immortal.\n\nAs long as you are a being, there will be birth and death. But that immortality is neither a being nor a non-being. It's not that because it's not a being, it has no existence. He said it is neither a being nor non-being. It is not a being because it does not have any qualities of a limited being. Therefore it cannot be defined by shape, color, form, or need.\n\nTherefore it's not a being, but also not non-being. It's not non-existent -- it exists, and therefore it's also not non-being. And then we have seen the verse which says: now I need to know what is to be known. I know what knowledge is. But what is to be known -- that which is neither a being nor a non-being?\n\nWe have seen this description before in chapter 11, the Vishvarupa. \"I see thousands of mouths and thousands of hands and thousands of eyes.\" As we have also discussed, in the Purusha Suktam of the Rig Veda it is: Sahasra-shirsha Purushah, Sahasrakshah, Sahasrapat -- thousands of heads, thousands of eyes, thousands of feet. Once again he repeats: Sarvatah pani-padam -- everywhere the hands and legs; Tat sarvatah akshi-shiro-mukham -- everywhere the eyes, heads, and mouths.\n\nAll hands and legs are His. All eyes and heads and mouths are His. Sarvatah shruti-mat loke -- all the ears are His. Sarvam avritya tishthati -- He remains pervading all, pervading everywhere.\n\nEven though He does not have any qualities, He pervades all the ears, all the hands, all the mouths, all the heads -- everything that I can think of, He's pervading all. Sarva-indriya-guna-abhasam -- He is shining through all the senses. His presence is felt through the senses. When I can see, I know I'm alive.\n\nWhen I can hear, I know I'm alive. The proof of my existence is that it's shining through my senses. As long as my eyes are seeing and my mouth is speaking, people can vouch for it -- \"I think he's okay.\" When it is not, then simply, life is gone. He is shining through all the indriyas.\n\nSarva-indriya-vivarjitam -- but He is devoid of all indriyas. Here comes the conundrum. This is taught in dichotomies because we cannot understand the subtlety of it. We try to explain, but we can't fully explain. Therefore we have to explain in pairs of opposites -- like saying neither night nor day, pointing to something beyond both.",
      "reflection": "Now Krishna describes what is to be known (jneyam) - that Brahman which, when known, grants immortality. The description is deliberately paradoxical: \"na sat tan nasad ucyate\" - It is neither being nor non-being. It has hands and feet everywhere, eyes and heads everywhere, ears everywhere, yet It is beyond all senses. It sustains everything yet is unattached. It is without qualities yet experiences all qualities. These paradoxes are not logical contradictions but pointers to a reality that transcends the either/or categories of the mind.\n\nContemplate the teaching that your true Self \"shines through every sense perception\" (sarvendriya-gunabhasam) yet is \"beyond the senses\" (sarvendriya-vivarjitam). When you see, there is seeing happening - but the awareness that knows \"I am seeing\" is not itself seen. When you hear, there is hearing - but the awareness that knows \"I am hearing\" is not itself heard. Today, during ordinary activities, try to catch glimpses of this: the Knower that is present in all knowing but is never itself an object of knowledge.\n\nAs a practical exercise, sit with a candle flame or look at any object. Notice the seeing. Then ask: what is aware of the seeing? You cannot see it, yet without it, no seeing would be known. This is what the verse means by \"sustains everything yet is unattached\" - your awareness supports every experience yet remains untouched by any experience. Rest in this recognition even briefly, and you touch the immortal."

He basically says that knowledge of the field plus the knowledge of the knower of the field equals knowledge of the Supreme Self. To find this enlightenment, Bhagavan said you need to know both -- the field of experiences and the experiencer. In the same verse, he told us that the Kshetrajna is only one. \"I am the Supreme Lord, the experiencer in all the fields. I am the knower in all the fields.\" As we have discussed before, the consciousness is one and all-pervading, but it manifests through the equipment which we call body, mind, and intellect.\n\nWe feel that this consciousness is within me. But in the last few verses, Bhagavan has described that consciousness as all-pervading. I feel it is within me because it is within and without all things and beings. All things and beings are in the consciousness, but we feel the consciousness is within me. Very similar to our analogy of space -- we think the space is in the room, but actually the room is in the space. We have been given a detailed explanation about the Kshetra.\n\nSo we have seen the definition of Kshetra from verse 6 to 7. What is the field of experience? It says this body is the field, which includes the five great elements, all the way up to the modifications of mind, up to fortitude, the dhriti. So everything that I consider as part of my world is included in the field of experiences. And then from verse 8 through 12, Bhagavan has described qualities to be developed, starting from humility, Amanitvam, ending with Tattvajnana-artha-darshanam -- the goal of knowing the knower of the field. What is the purpose of having this knowledge that Bhagavan has described?\n\nAnd these qualities are the means to achieve the knowledge. So Bhagavan called developing these qualities or having these qualities \"knowledge.\" Anything other than that is ignorance. The opposite of all those qualities is ignorance. All these things are limiting me -- this showing off, this high opinion about myself.\n\nBecause of that, when I hurt other people knowingly or unknowingly, that's the expression of ignorance. So anything other than these 20 qualities, Bhagavan called it ignorance. And then Bhagavan has described what is to be known in very contradictory terms. Starting from verse 13: Anadi mat-param Brahma. That Brahman which needs to be known is beginningless, and na sat tan nasat ucyate -- it is neither being (sat) nor non-being (asat).\n\nIt is also not nothing. So in these contradictory terms, Bhagavan has been explaining the nature of the supreme Brahman that is to be known. That is the goal of knowledge. We came to the last verse we have discussed: Bahir antas cha bhutanam acharam charam eva cha. That supreme Being is within and without all beings.\n\nIt is easier for us to think that He is within me and within all the sentient beings. Very, very difficult for me to imagine that He is also outside of me. It appears to be within me, but actually my equipment is within this supreme consciousness. Space seems to be within the room, defined by its conditionings -- four walls, ceiling and floor. But actually space was always here and it will always remain here, even when you remove these conditionings.\n\nEven though this equipment I call myself is identified with the body, mind and intellect, and it seems to be the container for this consciousness -- actually, it is within the consciousness. Acharam charam eva cha -- so it is not just limited to the beings but also things, whether moving or unmoving, within and outside. However, I have no direct experience of this.\n\nSo Bhagavan says it is because Sukshmatvat tad avijneyam -- it is so subtle that it is not easy to know. Things which are within the capabilities of my senses, I can perceive them. So I can see the visible light. Light is a form of electromagnetic wave, and within the capabilities of my eyes I can see the visible light.\n\nBut any other electromagnetic wave beyond that, I'm not capable of seeing. Radio waves are all over in this room, but I'm not capable of detecting them. But with the right equipment, they can be detected. They are so subtle that my senses are not capable of grasping them. That does not mean they do not exist. Bhagavan says Sukshmatvat tad avijneyam -- because the supreme Self, the supreme consciousness which is everywhere, it is not known to us because of its subtlety. Durastham -- for those who are ignorant about its nature, it is too far to find right now.\n\nIt is very overwhelming for me to even think that consciousness is everywhere. Therefore it is too far for me. But it is also very close -- Antike cha tat -- to those who understand its very nature. So one who understands its very nature through experience, for him it is so close because it cannot be any further than my own self. How far am I from my own self? There is no distance to be measured there. I am who I am, where I am. If that \"I am\" is the same as the supreme Consciousness, if that understanding takes place, Bhagavan said, it is very, very close to you.\n\nIt is far for the people who have not understood its real nature, but very close to the people who understood its nature. Bhagavan continues in the next verse and says, Avibhaktam cha bhuteshu vibhaktam iva cha sthitam -- even though it is indivisible, undivided, ever present, all pervading, it also appears to remain in people as divided selves. This is something similar to the space we have discussed. Even though the space is indivisible -- space cannot be divided, cannot be cut, cannot be separated, cannot be made into pieces -- I feel it is divided among all the rooms and buildings and huts and whatever type of containers that I can imagine in this world.\n\nSo space is divided into small box, big box, small house, big house. However, its very nature is indivisible. So these days, repurposing the old building is a big trend. Because as we, as we call the greenest building is the one which is not built. The second greenest building is one which is repurposed, which is existing. When you repurpose the building, it's always old, really messy.\n\nBut if you are trained in that profession, then you will visualize the space without all the distractions you have from the existing walls and floors and ceilings. Then you figure out that if I can combine all this space and repurpose it, I can make it useful for whatever the purpose. We are using this building because the space is always indivisible. It is I as the architect who put those divisions in it. So Bhagavan says for all the people who feel that the consciousness within them -- He remains as the knower within them, but He remains the same for everyone. Avibhaktam -- never gets divided, never gets polluted, never gets tainted, never gets affected by all the qualities of all those things and beings.\n\nBut He remains as He is, though appearing to be divided in beings. Bhuta-bhartru cha taj jneyam -- He is the supporter of all. When I exist in my present state, He is the supporter of my existence. I exist because I'm conscious. My consciousness is the supporter of my existence. Bhuta-bhartr -- the sustainer of all beings. So the same supreme Being which has no qualities, neither Sat nor Asat.\n\nWhen He sustains this world, He becomes Vishnu, Bhuta-bhartr. When He devours that, when that existence ends, He is the devourer. When the time of Pralaya comes, He devours the whole world, and it goes back into that unmanifest state -- so He is Grasisnu, the devourer. He is also the devourer of all things and beings. When I die, my consciousness associated with this limited self will not be there. So He is the devourer of my existence as it exists today.\n\nPrabhavisnu cha -- when I come into existence in a new form or when I came into existence in this form, He was the generator. Without that awareness that I exist, I do not exist. That awareness started right from my birth. The very first breath you take, you realize \"I am.\" Bhagavan said, Taj jneyam Grasisnu Prabhavisnu cha -- that which is to be known is the sustainer of this universe and all things and beings.\n\nHe is also the devourer of all things and beings. He is also the generator of things and beings. Taj jneyam -- you need to know that. So if I cannot know that right now, then the question would be whether that is because of darkness. The things which are unavailable to me, I consider that to be ignorance. Bhagavan addresses this in the next verse.\n\nNo, that is not the case. Jyotisham api taj jyotih -- It is the light of all lights. You know, the sun is self-effulgent. But to see the sunlight I have to be conscious. If I'm not conscious, the sun does not exist for me.\n\nSunlight does not exist for me. Therefore my consciousness is actually the illuminator of the sun which is self-effulgent. Tamasah param ucyate -- beyond darkness. Where there is knowledge, there cannot be ignorance. Where there is light, there cannot be darkness. Therefore this Self which is aware of its own self -- it is the light of all lights. It is the source of all knowledge.\n\nIt is the source of all my experiences. Jnana-gamyam -- it resides in all hearts in a very special way. Not just that it stays there as an inactive entity -- in a very special way it participates in all its activities, all that person's activities. So Hridi sarvasya vishthitam -- He stays in the hearts of all, at the core of my consciousness, my intellect, my mind. Jnanam Jneyam Jnana-gamyam -- knowledge, that which is to be known, and also the means to that knowledge. So all three, Bhagavan said, is one and the same -- the supreme Self. The knowledge, the purpose of knowing, and the means for the knowledge is the supreme Self. Iti kshetram tatha jnanam jneyam cha uktam samasatah -- so Bhagavan is concluding the topic saying, look, I told you in the beginning we're going to talk about Kshetra, Jnanam, and Jneyam.\n\nWe'll talk about the knowledge and what is to be known. I explained to you what the Kshetra is. I also explained what Jneyam is. Jneyam is that which pervades everywhere, but it seems like it's divided into all things and beings. I also explained what Jnanam is -- what is knowledge?\n\nKnowledge that enables me to know the supreme Self is true knowledge. Therefore we have seen those 20 qualities from Amanitvam to Tattvajnana-artha-darshanam, and I also explained to you what is to be known. My devotees, knowing these, will come to my being. As we have said in the beginning, Bhagavan has given this formula: the knowledge of the field plus the knowledge of the knower of the field equals the knowledge of the supreme Self. Now I've told you what is the goal. The goal is to know the Supreme Self, and the formula is to know the Kshetra and also know who is the knower of the Kshetra.\n\nWhat is my field of experiences and who is the experiencer? Once you have understood both, then you are my bhakta -- you have dissolved your individuality in that supreme Self. So mad-bhava ayopapadyate -- the one who has surrendered his individuality, one who has surrendered his sense of agency. Once I realized that what I considered to be \"me\" was actually my ego. When I considered myself as the knower of my experiences, the experiencer, the perceiver, feeler, thinker -- all these actually refer to my ego.",
      "reflection": "These verses reveal the supreme paradox: That which is to be known is \"within all beings yet outside\" (bahir antas cha bhutanam), \"motionless yet moving\" (acharam charam eva cha), \"far away yet near\" (durastham chantike cha tat), \"undivided yet appearing divided\" (avibhaktam cha bhuteshu vibhaktam iva cha sthitam). It is the Creator, Sustainer, and Destroyer - and the \"Light of all lights, beyond darkness\" (jyotisham api taj jyotih tamasah param). This is the formula Krishna promised: knowledge of field plus knowledge of Knower equals knowledge of the Supreme.\n\nThe analogy of space is illuminating here. Space appears to be inside the room, but actually the room is in space. Space appears divided by walls into rooms, but space itself is never divided. Similarly, consciousness appears to be \"inside\" your body, but actually your body-mind exists within consciousness. Consciousness appears divided among beings, but it remains ever undivided. Today, experiment with this shift in perspective: instead of feeling that awareness is inside you, sense that you (body, mind, thoughts) are arising within awareness.\n\nVerse 18 declares that this Supreme is \"seated in the hearts of all\" (hridi sarvasya vishthitam) - not as an inactive presence but participating in all activities. This is the witness (upadrashta), the permitter (anumanta), the supporter (bharta), and the enjoyer (bhokta). Notice today that your every action has a witness. When you eat, something knows you are eating. When you work, something knows you are working. This knowing presence is not far away in some heaven - it is \"nearer than near,\" the very core of your being."

But however, I have no experience of this.\n\nSo Bhagavan says it is because suksma twat on vignam. It is so subtle that it is not easy to know. So things which are within the capabilities of my senses, I can perceive them. So I can see the visible light. Light is the form of an electromagnetic wave. But within the capabilities of my eyes I can see the visible light.\n\nBut any other electromagnetic wave beyond that, I'm not capable of seeing them.

So Bhagavan seat for all the people who feel that the concept within them, he remains as the knower within them, but he remains same for everyone. Aviv Bhaktam never gets divided, never gets polluted, never gets chained never gets affected by all the qualities of all those things and beings.\n\nBut he remains as he is, but appears to be divided in beings. Bhuta Bhartrucha Tatgneam Bhuta Bharat Rahu is the supporter of all. When I exist in my present state, he is a supporter of my existence. I exist because I'm conscious. My consciousness is the supporter of my existence with Bhuta Bhartra. So the same supreme being which is no qualities, neither Sat nor Asat.\n\nWhen he sustains this world, he becomes Vishnu Bhuta Bhartra _part. When he devours that, when that existence ends, he is the devourer. When the time of Pralaya he devours the whole world, goes back into that unmanifest state so that he is _part. He is also the devourer of all things and being. When I'll die, my consciousness associated with this limited self will not be there. So he is the devourer of my existence as it exists today.\n\nPrabha Vishnucha When I come into the existence in a new form or when I came into existence in this form, he was the generator. Without that awareness that I exist, I do not exist. That awareness started right from my birth. The very breath you take, you realize that I am so. Bhagavan said Tat Ganeyam _part Prabhupishnucha. I am the sustainer of this universe and all things and beings.\n\nI am also devourer of all things and beings. I am also the generator of things in being. _part, you need to know that. _part so if I cannot know that right now, then the question would be whether that's darkness. The things which are unavailable to me, I consider that to be its ignorance. Bhagavan says in the next question.\n\nNo, that is not the case. Jyoti Sam Apita Jyoti hi. It is the light of all lights. You know, the sun is self effulgent. But to see the sunlight I have to be conscious. If I'm not conscious, the sun does not exist for me.\n\nSunlight does not exist for me. Therefore my consciousness is actually the illuminator of the sun which is self effulgent. Tamasah Jyoti Tamasah Paramuchya beyond darkness, where there is knowledge, there cannot be ignorance. Where there is light, there cannot be darkness. Therefore this self which is very aware of its own self, it is the light of all lights. It is the source of all knowledge.\n\nIt is the source of all my experiences _part Gneanagamya it resides in all hearts in a very special way _part not just that it stays there as inactive entity in a very special way it participates in all its activities. All that person's activities. So Rudhi Sarvasive Sisthitam he stays in the hearts of all hearts the core of my consciousness, my intellect, my mind. _part _part Gnanagamyam that is knowledge also that is to be known There is also _part it is the object of the knowledge. So all three Bhagavan said is the one and the same, the supreme Self, the knowledge, the purpose of the knowing, the knowledge and the means for the knowledge is the supreme Self. ITI _part Tatha _part _part Cha Uktam sama Sataha so Bhagavan is concluding the topic saying look, I told you in the beginning we're going to talk about _part and _part _part.\n\nWe'll talk about the knowledge and what is to be known. I explained to you what the _part is. So explained what _part? _part is the one which pervades everywhere. But it seems like divided into all things and beings. Also explained to _part what is knowledge?\n\nKnowledge that enables me to know the supreme self is the knowledge. Therefore we have seen those 20 qualities from Amanitvam to Tatvagnan Orthodarsanam and also explain to you what is to be known. My devotees knowing these will come to my being. As we have said in the beginning Bhagavan has given this formula the knowledge of the field plus the knowledge of the knower of the field equals to the knowledge of the supreme Self. But once now I told you what is the goal? The goal is to know the Supreme Self and the formula is to know the _part and also know the who is the knower of _part?\n\nWhat is my field of experiences and who is the experiencer? Once you have understood both then you are my _part that you have dissolved your individuality in that supreme self. So mad _part, the one who has surrendered his individuality, one who has surrendered his sense of agency. Once I realized that _part in me I considered to be my ego. So when I considered my consciousness, I am the knower of my experiences, the experiencer, the perceiver, feeler, thinker actually refer to my ego.",
      "reflection": "Krishna now reveals the relationship between Prakriti (Nature) and Purusha (Spirit): both are beginningless (anadi). All modifications (vikaras) and qualities (gunas) arise from Prakriti alone. Prakriti is the cause of all action through body and senses (karya-karana-kartritva), while Purusha is the cause of experiencing pleasure and pain (sukha-duhkhanam bhoktritva). This is a crucial discrimination: your body acts, your mind thinks, your senses perceive - all this is Prakriti at work. But the sense of \"I am experiencing this\" - that witnessing presence - is Purusha.\n\nReflect on this division of labor in your own experience. When your hand moves, it is Prakriti moving. When your mind worries, it is Prakriti worrying. But the awareness that knows \"my hand is moving\" or \"my mind is worrying\" - that is the Purusha principle. The Purusha never acts; it only witnesses. Today, notice how naturally you attribute actions to yourself: \"I am walking,\" \"I am thinking,\" \"I am feeling.\" Can you shift to recognizing: \"Walking is happening and I am aware of it,\" \"Thinking is happening and I am aware of it\"?\n\nThe practical implication is liberating: if you are not the doer, you need not carry the burden of doership. Your body-mind will continue to act according to its nature and karma, but you - as awareness - can witness without being crushed by the weight of endless doing. This is not passivity or irresponsibility; it is acting from clarity rather than compulsion. As an exercise, perform one routine task today with full attention but with the inner attitude: \"Prakriti is doing this; I am the witnessing presence.\""

      "commentary": "We have been discussing Chapter 13, Kshetra Kshetrajna Vibhaga Yoga, Yoga of Discrimination between the Field and its Knower. So far in this chapter, Bhagavan has described the Kshetra -- that this body is the Kshetra, which includes not only the external instruments but also the internal instruments: mind, Buddhi, Chitta, Ahankara, and all their modifications. The Kshetrajna is Paramatma alone. The Supreme Lord, the God, the Almighty, the all-pervading consciousness is the Kshetrajna in all the fields. Then he said, \"I'm going to tell you what is Jnanam, Jneyam, and Jnana-gamyam\" -- what is knowledge, what is to be known, and how.\n\nThen he explained how Purusha and Prakriti are related to each other. Purusha and Prakriti intertwine and create this world which we experience. Both are beginningless; both are aspects of Ishwara. In our cosmology, we have Purusha and Prakriti -- both beginningless, but controlled by Ishwara. Ishwara is the Mayapati.\n\nIshvara is in charge of Maya. Brahman with Maya becomes Ishwara, and Ishwara is the Mayapati -- with his Maya, he controls both Prakriti and Purusha. Purusha is the knower. The attributes of Purusha we have seen are Sat, Chit, and Ananda -- Sat (existence), Chit (knowledge), and Ananda (bliss). These are the attributes of Purusha, the knower.\n\nPrakriti has three Gunas: Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas. Purusha has no Gunas; Prakriti has three Gunas. Purusha is sentient, conscious. But the interaction between the two creates this world that we experience. That's basically what we have learned so far. The last verse we saw says: Purushah Prakriti-sthah hi, bhunkte Prakriti-jan gunan.\n\nWhen seated in Prakriti, when intertwined with the Prakriti, it experiences all the gunas of the Prakriti. Karanam Guna, Sangasya Sad Asat, Yoni Janmasu. And attachment to the Gunas is the cause for the birth in good or not so good wombs. In other words, the existence which I experience right now in this life is because of my attachment and avidya to the Gunas in my past life. Maybe two years before or before my birth. What I'm experiencing today is because of my attachment to the gunas of the Prakriti.\n\nBecause as the Purusha adopted all the Gunas so Purusha coming in contact with the Prakriti. All the gunas of the Prakriti are superimposed on the Purusha Purushas. All the attributes get superimposed in the Prakriti. So Prakriti experience the Satchit and Ananda. That's why we experience the sense of existence. And also we experience Sukha and Dukha as we have seen in this everywhere.\n\nPrakriti on the other hand becomes sentient. Therefore my body becomes sentient, inert body becomes sentient. My mind knows and I also feel that Ananda or Sukharga. So he said Purusha Prante, Prakti. That's the reason we come into being. So we have like three bodies.\n\nThe gross body which everybody can see. The subtle body which is the internal instrument, the mind Buddhi Chitta Nahanka and the causal body which is the cause for both these bodies to come into existence. Which is my left Tor Vasanas, leftover desires which is what we learned in this previous chapter. The leftover impressions and desires prompt me to take birth in this particular situation. So these two bodies come into existence because of the past Karma Bhagavan Sangha is Sat Karma Janyam. Because of your good actions you achieve this gross and subtle body in this life.\n\nAnd then he said, how this Pratibimba I think Jina, your question was is there anything reflecting? And Bhagavan Sankaraja Satupa directly answered that question saying Sthula Sarira Abhimani Jiva Namakam Brahmaprati Bambam Bhavati Sa Eva Jivaha Prakritya Swasmat Iswaram Binnat Vena Janati. So it says that the reflection of Brahman, the all pervading Almighty consciousness which is immutable undividable. Its reflection occurs in the internal instrument of that being. That being now receives the impressions reflection of the Brahman. And that is called Jiva.\n\nNow this Brahman as the Purusha reflecting in the internal instrument of individual ego is called Jiva. So it's called Jivaatma atma. The self or the soul, it's called Jiva atma. This Jiva by nature of ignorance consider itself to be different from the Ishvara. This is where we not experience the almightiness of Ishvara. The consciousness which we have is nothing but the Buddhist all pervading Purusha's consciousness.\n\nThe Purusa as my soul has the same nature as the Brahman which is of Sat, Chit and Ananda. So this Sat aspect gives me the sense of existence. The Cheetah aspect gives me the sense of knowing. That's why I know myself, I know the world around me. I know my relationships that comes from that. And Ananda that I experience Sukhendukha in my life.\n\nSo this reflection is in my internal instrument. This internal instrument is right now not clean enough. It is also reflecting all other things of Prakriti. So this is more like if I am sitting in a dark room and suddenly light comes on and I see there are mirrors all around me. In that mirror not only I see myself but I also see everything in the room. Now not only I recognize myself in in the mirror but I also recognize everything in the room and I start identifying with them.\n\nSo the internal instrument not only reflects the Purusha, it also reflecting the world of objects. All the sensory perceptions we get, we get the sensation through our senses on the internal instrument. The internal instrument is like a mirror or like a film in a camera. It captures everything which comes to it whether it's a Purusha or the world of objects. It captures all the images. That sensation creates perception in the mind.\n\nThen the mind asks the intellect to interpret and it creates conception. That's how we conceive thoughts, we conceive ideas, we conceive things outside. So Bhagawan Shankaracharya says it is the Brahman reflecting in your internal instruments become your individual ego. But I don't recognize it the same as Ishvara. Purusha with the Upadi of Maya becomes Ishwara Purusha with the Upadi of ignorance. In my case same Purusha superimposed by the ignorance, he becomes Jiva, the individual soul conditioned consciousness in case of Lord, unconditioned consciousness superimposed by Maya, by creativity.\n\nWhy Bhagavan creates the world? Because it is the very nature of that Purusha. So with that we'll go to the next verse. So next verse says, even though I see that as the cause for my birth in this Sansar, but this supreme Purusa in me, the reflection of the Brahman which I consider to be my limited self, also can be seen as Upadrista, Anumanta, Chabharta, Loka, Maheshwaraha, Paramatma, Iticha, opi Uktaha, dehe Ashmin, Purushah, Paraha, that Purushahaparaha, the supreme Purusha. In this body, the same supreme being which is everywhere, also in the same body. I call myself a Jiva.\n\nAn individual ego also is called Upadrasta, the onlooker. Because it is not really taking any part in the activities of my body, mind and intellect. This gross body, this subtle mind and intellect, they're functioning all the time. They are empowered by consciousness, consciousness not taking part in it. Therefore it is also called Upadrasta, onlooker, anumantacha. So that onlooker does not really discriminate between the good activity or bad activities.\n\nBut when my mind is thinking something higher, something nobler, something greater, he also becomes permitter. He allows me to act in that particular manner which will help me in my evolution. When I act in that manner, he becomes Bharata, the supporter of my activities and my evolution. He also becomes Bhokta. He also become the enjoyer of those actions. So this Purusha in me is a witness.\n\nHe also permits all the things which I do, good or evil. But when it is good, it allows me to grow, then also makes me enjoy those fruits of actions. He is also called Maheshwarah because he is no different than the Great Lord himself. Therefore he is also called Maheshwara. Maheshwara the Great Lord himself and Paramatma in the supreme soul. But looking from the different perspective, when I grow out of my ignorance that I am this body, I am this mind intellect, then I see him as the same Lord Paramatma.\n\nI see him as Maheshwara, the Great Ishwara. So there is no difference between the Lord outside and Lord within me. Therefore, Bhagawan Shankaracharya says this should not be accepted. That Jiva and Paramatma are two different entities. It is one and the same, seen from two different perspectives, one through the lens of ignorance and Other through the lens of knowledge. Sa evam vitti purusam prakritim cha gunaihi saha sarvatha vartamano PI nasabuyo abhijayate.\n\nSuch a person who knows Purusha and Prakruti in their real nature, he knows that nature Purusha is satchit and Ananda. It never gets tainted by Prakruti's gunas. But Prakruti's gunas are superimposed on the Purusha when it comes in contact with it. We have heard example in Brahma sutras that if you take an iron ball and put it in fire, each will give its own gunas to the other. So the fire which is red hot, now the ball looks red hot. So the fire attributes are now on the iron ball.\n\nAnd the fire which was formless, now you can see the round shape. Because that ball was round, you see the red hot ball of iron. So each gives its own attributes to the other when they come in contact with each other. So in this case also that we have seen that the Prakrudin Purusa gives each other their own attributes. One who knows that that they remain separate. They seem to be associated with each other.\n\nThey seem to be taking each other's gunas, but they remain separate Gunehi Saha including the gunas, Sarvatha, Varsamanoapi. No matter what situation or condition that person is, he doesn't take the next board. And this is somewhat of a difficult concept because it basically says all my actions in the past and present and future get nullified when I get this knowledge. So there are some technical arguments made here that what happens to the actions which I have performed in the past which are Sanchita Karma? So the actions are three types. Sanchida Karma, Agami Karma and Prarabdha Karma.\n\nPrarabdha Karmas are which I am experiencing right now. The past actions mature today as my circumstances. I went to architecture school. I'm an architect now. That's a Prarabdhyakarna. So if a Gnani becomes knowledgeable about this, do all his karmas get nullified?\n\nAnd the answer is no. He will continue to experience the Prarabdha Karma which I have matured now in this life. So you will still live this life. But then this Sanchita Karma which accumulated actions which are not yet matured, they get roasted so they never will fructify. And Agame Karma, which I will perform now onward, will have no Meaning because it does not create any more vasanas in me. We have realized that I am not this limited being.\n\nAnd therefore I don't associate any of the gunas of the body, mind and intellect, even though body, mind and intellect continue to function as they were before. Therefore, these verses say, such a person, at the end of the exhaustion of this life, he will not take the birth again. So I'll leave it to you how you take it. But that's exactly what this verse says. The next verse says how people achieve the state of knowledge, that all the accumulated actions get burned. Prarabdha Karma means nothing because I don't really see myself as the enjoyer, sufferer, as a limited being.\n\nAnd no actions in the future will make and any difference. Some highly qualified seekers, seekers of liberation, seekers of ultimate happiness, those who are highly qualified, they will achieve this by contemplation.",
      "reflection": "These verses explain the mechanism of bondage and liberation. When Purusha (consciousness) is \"seated in Prakriti\" (prakritistho), it experiences the gunas born of Prakriti. Attachment to these gunas (guna-sanga) is the cause of birth in good or evil wombs (sad-asad-yoni-janmasu). Yet this same Purusha in the body is called the Witness (upadrashta), the Permitter (anumanta), the Supporter (bharta), the Enjoyer (bhokta), the Great Lord (Maheshvara), and the Supreme Self (Paramatma). The one who truly knows Purusha and Prakriti with their gunas \"is not born again\" (na sa bhuyo 'bhijayate).\n\nThe image of iron in fire is instructive: when iron enters fire, it takes on the qualities of fire (red, hot, glowing), and fire takes on the form of iron (round, if a ball). Yet iron remains iron and fire remains fire. Similarly, when consciousness associates with Prakriti, each seems to take on the other's qualities - consciousness seems to act and suffer, matter seems to be aware. But in reality, neither has changed its essential nature. Today, notice how you attribute consciousness to your body (\"my body feels tired\") and how you attribute material qualities to yourself (\"I am heavy, I am old\"). Can you begin to untangle these superimpositions?\n\nVerse 24 promises liberation to one who knows this: \"sarvatha vartamano 'pi\" - in whatever condition one may live. You do not need to change your circumstances; you need to change your understanding. The question for reflection: If liberation depends on knowledge, not on external conditions, what is stopping you right now from knowing yourself as the witnessing Purusha rather than the acting Prakriti?"

      "commentary": "We have been discussing Chapter 13, Kshetra Kshetrajna Vibhaga Yoga, Yoga of Discrimination between the Field and its Knower. So far in this chapter, Bhagavan has described the Kshetra -- that this body is the Kshetra, which includes not only the external instruments but also the internal instruments: mind, Buddhi, Chitta, Ahankara, and all their modifications. The Kshetrajna is Paramatma alone. The Supreme Lord, the God, the Almighty, the all-pervading consciousness is the Kshetrajna in all the fields. Then he said, \"I'm going to tell you what is Jnanam, Jneyam, and Jnana-gamyam\" -- what is knowledge, what is to be known, and how.\n\nThen he explained how Purusha and Prakriti are related to each other. Purusha and Prakriti intertwine and create this world which we experience. Both are beginningless; both are aspects of Ishwara. In our cosmology, we have Purusha and Prakriti -- both beginningless, but controlled by Ishwara. Ishwara is the Mayapati.\n\nIshvara is in charge of Maya. Brahman with Maya becomes Ishwara, and Ishwara is the Mayapati -- with his Maya, he controls both Prakriti and Purusha. Purusha is the knower. The attributes of Purusha we have seen are Sat, Chit, and Ananda -- Sat (existence), Chit (knowledge), and Ananda (bliss). These are the attributes of Purusha, the knower.\n\nPrakriti has three Gunas: Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas. Purusha has no Gunas; Prakriti has three Gunas. Purusha is sentient, conscious. But the interaction between the two creates this world that we experience. That's basically what we have learned so far. The last verse we saw says: Purushah Prakriti-sthah hi, bhunkte Prakriti-jan gunan.\n\nWhen seated in Prakriti, when intertwined with the Prakriti, it experiences all the gunas of the Prakriti. Karanam Guna, Sangasya Sad Asat, Yoni Janmasu. And attachment to the Gunas is the cause for the birth in good or not so good wombs. In other words, the existence which I experience right now in this life is because of my attachment and avidya to the Gunas in my past life. Maybe two years before or before my birth. What I'm experiencing today is because of my attachment to the gunas of the Prakriti.\n\nBecause as the Purusha adopted all the Gunas so Purusha coming in contact with the Prakriti. All the gunas of the Prakriti are superimposed on the Purusha Purushas. All the attributes get superimposed in the Prakriti. So Prakriti experience the Satchit and Ananda. That's why we experience the sense of existence. And also we experience Sukha and Dukha as we have seen in this everywhere.\n\nPrakriti on the other hand becomes sentient. Therefore my body becomes sentient, inert body becomes sentient. My mind knows and I also feel that Ananda or Sukharga. So he said Purusha Prante, Prakti. That's the reason we come into being. So we have like three bodies.\n\nThe gross body which everybody can see. The subtle body which is the internal instrument, the mind Buddhi Chitta Nahanka and the causal body which is the cause for both these bodies to come into existence. Which is my left Tor Vasanas, leftover desires which is what we learned in this previous chapter. The leftover impressions and desires prompt me to take birth in this particular situation. So these two bodies come into existence because of the past Karma Bhagavan Sangha is Sat Karma Janyam. Because of your good actions you achieve this gross and subtle body in this life.\n\nAnd then he said, how this Pratibimba I think Jina, your question was is there anything reflecting? And Bhagavan Sankaraja Satupa directly answered that question saying Sthula Sarira Abhimani Jiva Namakam Brahmaprati Bambam Bhavati Sa Eva Jivaha Prakritya Swasmat Iswaram Binnat Vena Janati. So it says that the reflection of Brahman, the all pervading Almighty consciousness which is immutable undividable. Its reflection occurs in the internal instrument of that being. That being now receives the impressions reflection of the Brahman. And that is called Jiva.\n\nNow this Brahman as the Purusha reflecting in the internal instrument of individual ego is called Jiva. So it's called Jivaatma atma. The self or the soul, it's called Jiva atma. This Jiva by nature of ignorance consider itself to be different from the Ishvara. This is where we not experience the almightiness of Ishvara. The consciousness which we have is nothing but the Buddhist all pervading Purusha's consciousness.\n\nThe Purusa as my soul has the same nature as the Brahman which is of Sat, Chit and Ananda. So this Sat aspect gives me the sense of existence. The Cheetah aspect gives me the sense of knowing. That's why I know myself, I know the world around me. I know my relationships that comes from that. And Ananda that I experience Sukhendukha in my life.\n\nSo this reflection is in my internal instrument. This internal instrument is right now not clean enough. It is also reflecting all other things of Prakriti. So this is more like if I am sitting in a dark room and suddenly light comes on and I see there are mirrors all around me. In that mirror not only I see myself but I also see everything in the room. Now not only I recognize myself in in the mirror but I also recognize everything in the room and I start identifying with them.\n\nSo the internal instrument not only reflects the Purusha, it also reflecting the world of objects. All the sensory perceptions we get, we get the sensation through our senses on the internal instrument. The internal instrument is like a mirror or like a film in a camera. It captures everything which comes to it whether it's a Purusha or the world of objects. It captures all the images. That sensation creates perception in the mind.\n\nThen the mind asks the intellect to interpret and it creates conception. That's how we conceive thoughts, we conceive ideas, we conceive things outside. So Bhagawan Shankaracharya says it is the Brahman reflecting in your internal instruments become your individual ego. But I don't recognize it the same as Ishvara. Purusha with the Upadi of Maya becomes Ishwara Purusha with the Upadi of ignorance. In my case same Purusha superimposed by the ignorance, he becomes Jiva, the individual soul conditioned consciousness in case of Lord, unconditioned consciousness superimposed by Maya, by creativity.\n\nWhy Bhagavan creates the world? Because it is the very nature of that Purusha. So with that we'll go to the next verse. So next verse says, even though I see that as the cause for my birth in this Sansar, but this supreme Purusa in me, the reflection of the Brahman which I consider to be my limited self, also can be seen as Upadrista, Anumanta, Chabharta, Loka, Maheshwaraha, Paramatma, Iticha, opi Uktaha, dehe Ashmin, Purushah, Paraha, that Purushahaparaha, the supreme Purusha. In this body, the same supreme being which is everywhere, also in the same body. I call myself a Jiva.\n\nAn individual ego also is called Upadrasta, the onlooker. Because it is not really taking any part in the activities of my body, mind and intellect. This gross body, this subtle mind and intellect, they're functioning all the time. They are empowered by consciousness, consciousness not taking part in it. Therefore it is also called Upadrasta, onlooker, anumantacha. So that onlooker does not really discriminate between the good activity or bad activities.\n\nBut when my mind is thinking something higher, something nobler, something greater, he also becomes permitter. He allows me to act in that particular manner which will help me in my evolution. When I act in that manner, he becomes Bharata, the supporter of my activities and my evolution. He also becomes Bhokta. He also become the enjoyer of those actions. So this Purusha in me is a witness.\n\nHe also permits all the things which I do, good or evil. But when it is good, it allows me to grow, then also makes me enjoy those fruits of actions. He is also called Maheshwarah because he is no different than the Great Lord himself. Therefore he is also called Maheshwara. Maheshwara the Great Lord himself and Paramatma in the supreme soul. But looking from the different perspective, when I grow out of my ignorance that I am this body, I am this mind intellect, then I see him as the same Lord Paramatma.\n\nI see him as Maheshwara, the Great Ishwara. So there is no difference between the Lord outside and Lord within me. Therefore, Bhagawan Shankaracharya says this should not be accepted. That Jiva and Paramatma are two different entities. It is one and the same, seen from two different perspectives, one through the lens of ignorance and Other through the lens of knowledge.

      "reflection": "Krishna now reveals the multiple paths to Self-knowledge: some realize the Self through meditation (dhyana), some through the yoga of knowledge (Sankhya), some through the yoga of action (Karma Yoga), and others simply through hearing from teachers and worshipping with faith (shrutva anyebhya upasate). The beautiful promise is that even those without direct knowledge, if they are \"devoted to what they have heard\" (shruti-parayanah), cross beyond death. This is enormously encouraging - the path is available to all, regardless of intellectual capacity or spiritual attainment.\n\nVerse 27 summarizes the entire teaching: wherever any being exists, movable or immovable (sthavara-jangamam), know it to be born from the union of Field and Knower (kshetra-kshetrajna-samyogat). This is like the observer effect in quantum physics - the particle manifests when observed. Similarly, the world of experience arises when consciousness (Knower) and matter (Field) come together. Today, look around at everything you see - people, animals, plants, objects. Each one exists because of this union. The same consciousness that looks through your eyes is present in all these forms.\n\nAs a practical exercise, choose one of the four paths mentioned for deeper exploration this week. If meditation suits you, set aside time for silent sitting. If you are intellectually inclined, study the distinction between Purusha and Prakriti more deeply. If action is your nature, practice Karma Yoga by offering your work as worship. If devotion calls to you, simply listen to the teachings with faith and let them transform you. All paths lead to the same recognition: you are not the Field but the Knower of the Field."

      "commentary": "What is my purpose and destiny? We have been discussing chapter 13, Kshetra Kshetrajna Vibhaga Yoga, Yoga of discrimination between the field and its Knower. This is the most analytical chapter in the Bhagavad Gita. It literally summarizes the whole philosophy of Vedanta. The goal of this chapter is to differentiate between the self and the non-self, the field and its knower. What we have seen so far is that Bhagavan has clearly defined the field and clearly defined who the knower of the field is.\n\nWe know that every being has his or her own consciousness. But we consider that to be different from each other. In the very beginning of the chapter, Bhagavan changed that paradigm and said the Kshetrajna is only one -- the pure Consciousness, the Supreme Self. The Supreme Being is the Kshetrajna in all the fields. He is the Knower of the field in all the fields. This is where we have to reconcile the parallax that we have -- we consider the Knower of the field in me, the Knower that I am, to be different from the Knower in other people.\n\nBhagavan basically started this chapter with that premise: the Knower is only one. In previous chapters, Bhagavan described his nature. In chapter 7 he describes that he has a lower Prakriti and a higher Prakriti. The lower Prakriti is the manifest world that we see. The higher Prakriti is the unmanifest consciousness which functions through this Prakriti. We discussed that Bhagavan as Ishwara is both the efficient cause and the material cause for this world -- the creation as we perceive it through our senses.\n\nThis world is a creation which I can perceive through my senses and vouch for -- it exists, the world exists. These are existences I can vouch for, and the creation is an effect. I myself am an effect; the world is an effect. So there has to be a Creator. We have come to the conclusion that there must be one Creator who created this universe, including my own self, including my own being. That Creator did not have any other source of material.\n\nHe could not buy, borrow, or steal material from any other source. Therefore, the only material available to him was his own self. He created this Jagat out of his own self, and so is my own being. Therefore, myself cannot be separate, cannot be different from his self, because the material provided for this Jagat is nothing but the Bhagavan's own self. In Sankhya philosophy, we have seen it described in a different way.\n\nPurusha and Prakriti. Purusha is the efficient cause and Prakriti is the material cause. Prakriti provides the material. Purusha is the consciousness agency which provide the efficient cause. Then we have discussed the Vedanta goes one step further. It says both the efficient cause, which is Purusha and Prakriti which is the material cause, are expression of the same entity, Brahman.\n\nThis Prakriti is created out of Maya. In appearance only -- no actual mutation took place in the self of that great Paramatma. But it appears to have mutated into this Prakriti, the world of plurality. We have understood this intellectually. If you take that argument, there is no difference between your Atma -- which you consider your consciousness, different from the Paramatma -- and the Supreme Being. Now what we are discussing is how that Supreme Being relates to the Prakriti. The last few verses we have seen are concluding verses, because in the verses before this, we saw how to recognize the Paramatma which is immutable, which is neither Sat nor Asat.\n\nSome recognize this through Dhyanam, some through Karma Yoga, some through just listening. Depending on your own capabilities, you can choose the path most appropriate for you to recognize that myself, the Atma which I consider my own being, is the same as Paramatma. Bhagavan now concludes this topic by saying: Yavat sanjayate kinchit, satvam sthavara-jangamam. Wherever you see any creation in this Jagat, know that the field and its knower have come together. Without the knower and the field coming together, there is no creation. It is like in quantum physics.\n\nThey say the particle only exists when somebody detects it. Unless there is an observer, the particle may be in the form of a probability wave. As soon as there is a detector, either individual or mechanical, the particle will manifest as a particle. So unless there is a knower, there is no field. And if there is a field, there has to be a knower of that field. The two exist in mutual existence.\n\nSo Bhagawan said, whenever there is a creation, both have to be there. Efficient cause and material cause. They both have to be present in that creation. So no O Bharatara Sabha, wherever there is creation, there are both material cause and efficient cause. Purusha Efficient cause, Prakriti material cause. However you should know.\n\nBhagavan said Samam sarveshu bhuteshu tishthantam parameshvaram -- seeing the supreme Lord equally present in all beings. Right now, because of my own Ahankar, this Aham-kartr Ahankar which says I am so unique that the paramatma in me is very unique compared to all other beings. The atma in all other beings -- dismissing the animals to be inferior, and even the worms to be inferior to anything else. So this notion that I have, this inflated evaluation of my own self, is a myth. This myth has to go away for me to recognize the paramatma. The myth which I have created in my own mind that I am unique and everybody else is just normal, that we are normal beings of this world.\n\nBut I myself am very unique. One who sees the same Atma, same paramatma as the atma in all beings -- Vinashyatsu avinashyantam yah pashyati sah pashyati. Right now I am seeing this world through my physical senses, through my eyes, through my understanding based on my limited sense perception. The sense perception has created the conception in my mind about what the world is and what my being is. But after getting the wisdom of this reality, Bhagavan said, one who starts seeing that immutable, imperishable paramatma -- which is the Purusha functioning as the knower of the field.\n\nThe knower in each field is not different from the knower in other fields. So he does not see this atma to be destructible in any being. Yah pashyati sah pashyati -- one who sees that indestructible atma in all perishable things and beings, he truly sees. I see things and beings all around me which are perishable in the sense that they have a beginning date and an end date.\n\nEverything that I see in the world, including the stars and galaxies, all have a beginning date and end date. The world around me is constantly changing. I myself am constantly changing. My body is changing, my mind is changing, my intellect is changing. But I am the witness of these changes in me.\n\nSo I must be different than the changes which are occurring in me, the same way the world which is changing requires a changeless knower. The knower of this universe must be changeless, just as I remain changeless throughout my existence as this limited being from my childhood to these old days. He said, one who sees that is the wise person. Samam pashyan hi sarvatra samavasthitam ishwaram na hinasty atmanatmanam tato yati param gatim. One who sees Ishwara pervading all beings, the same Ishwara everywhere -- he does not destroy the Self by the self, and therefore he achieves the higher state of existence.\n\nHe becomes one with That. We have seen this before. We learned in chapter 6, verse 5: Uddharet atmana atmanam na atmanam avasadayet -- lift yourself by yourself, don't let yourself fall. So we already learned, at least six chapters ago, that there are two selves in me.\n\nOne which is identified with this limited being -- the limited self which is conditioned consciousness. That limited self is constantly getting guidance from the higher Self which is the paramatma. My own conscience, my own antaratma, which guides me all the time. I know before I do anything whether it is right or wrong. My antaratma will tell me. My conscience will tell me whether I'm on the right path or not.\n\nI know this market is very hot and everybody is putting money in it. Maybe I should back out. But I'm not going to back out because I don't want to lose out. What if market continues to go up? Even though my antaratma said this is not the right way to go about in this market. I'll go and do it anyway.\n\nBhagavan is saying that you have let yourself down by your own self, by not listening to the higher Self. Bhagavan has advised us: don't let your lower self fall by not listening to your higher Self. The constant guidance from the higher Self is there. I'm always connected, even though I am not aware of it -- just as the conditioned space in the room is always connected with the universal space outside. There was never a division between the room space and the space outside. It is only in my mind that I see it as limited space.\n\nTherefore I call it \"room space.\" All the things which I consider the attributes of the room space are actually attributes of the conditioning of the room -- the walls, the length, width, height, whether the room is clean or dirty. I call it \"room space,\" but what I'm describing is the conditioning of that room. The same way, Bhagavan said, when I identify with this conditioning, the knower of the field appears to become limited.\n\nThat is the aham-kartr, the ahankar. When it reflects the consciousness, it itself thinks it is consciousness. That consciousness is now reflecting the limitations of the conditioning in the body, mind and intellect -- just as the room space appears to reflect the limitations of the room: how wide it is, how long it is, how tall it is. All those are attributes of the conditioning, not of the space.\n\nSo Bhagavan says: Samam pashyan hi sarvatra samavasthitam ishwaram -- one who sees this Ishwara pervading all knowers of these fields, he does not destroy the higher Self by the lower self. By completely identifying with the lower self, I'm literally disassociating myself from the higher Self. If I completely identify myself as the body, mind, intellect and say \"this is it\" -- Rinam kritva ghritam pibet yavaj jivet sukham jivet.\n\nEven if you incur debt, drink ghee, live happily -- after this body is burnt, there is no coming back. So live as comfortably as you can by whatever means. There is one type of philosophy which is Charvaka Darshan, one of the schools of thought in our Indian philosophy. But once again, if you are abiding by that thought, then you have completely negated the existence of the higher Self. You have disassociated yourself from the higher Self.\n\nYou are not recognizing the existence of the higher Self. That is killing your higher Self by identifying with the non-self. This ego is not the Self -- it is a thinking entity. This thinking entity is inert and cannot think unless it is energized by the Purusha's presence, the sentience in me. But the ego starts thinking, \"These are the qualities of mind, and therefore I am the Almighty for my world and I do not need any higher guidance.\"\n\nHe says such a person kills the higher Self by the lower self, and he does not see the real truth. One who does not do that achieves the higher state of existence. Prakritya eva cha karmani kriyamanani sarvashah -- one who sees that all actions are being performed within the Prakriti, by the Prakriti alone, and the Atma is the non-doer.",
      "reflection": "These verses describe the vision of the wise: one who sees the Supreme Lord equally present in all beings (samam sarveshu bhuteshu), the Imperishable amidst the perishable (vinashyatsu avinashyantam) - \"he alone truly sees\" (sa pashyati). Such a person, seeing the Lord equally everywhere, \"does not destroy the Self by the self\" (na hinasty atmanatmanam) and attains the supreme goal. The one who sees that all actions are performed by Prakriti alone, and that the Self is the non-doer (akartaram), truly sees.\n\nThe phrase \"does not destroy the Self by the self\" recalls Chapter 6: \"Let a person lift himself by himself; let him not degrade himself.\" Your lower self (ego identified with body-mind) can either serve or obstruct your higher Self (the witnessing consciousness). When you completely identify with the ego and deny the higher dimension, you \"kill\" your higher Self. When you recognize the ego as a useful instrument while anchoring your identity in awareness, you \"lift\" yourself. Reflect today: in what ways do you habitually \"destroy\" your higher nature by over-identifying with the limited self?\n\nVerse 30 provides the practical key: see that all actions are performed by Prakriti alone (prakritya eva cha karmani kriyamanani sarvashah). Your body moves, your breath flows, your thoughts arise - all this is Prakriti functioning according to its nature. The Self merely witnesses without acting. Today, choose one activity - perhaps brushing your teeth or preparing a meal - and observe it with this understanding: \"Prakriti is performing this action. I am the witnessing presence.\" Notice how this shift brings a natural ease and freedom to action."

      "commentary": "What is my purpose and destiny? We have been discussing chapter 13, Kshetra Kshetrajna Vibhaga Yoga, Yoga of discrimination between the field and its Knower. This is the most analytical chapter in the Bhagavad Gita. It literally summarizes the whole philosophy of Vedanta. The goal of this chapter is to differentiate between the self and the non-self, the field and its knower. What we have seen so far is that Bhagavan has clearly defined the field and clearly defined who the knower of the field is.\n\nWe know that every being has his or her own consciousness. But we consider that to be different from each other. In the very beginning of the chapter, Bhagavan changed that paradigm and said the Kshetrajna is only one -- the pure Consciousness, the Supreme Self. The Supreme Being is the Kshetrajna in all the fields. He is the Knower of the field in all the fields. This is where we have to reconcile the parallax that we have -- we consider the Knower of the field in me, the Knower that I am, to be different from the Knower in other people.\n\nBhagavan basically started this chapter with that premise: the Knower is only one. In previous chapters, Bhagavan described his nature. In chapter 7 he describes that he has a lower Prakriti and a higher Prakriti. The lower Prakriti is the manifest world that we see. The higher Prakriti is the unmanifest consciousness which functions through this Prakriti. We discussed that Bhagavan as Ishwara is both the efficient cause and the material cause for this world -- the creation as we perceive it through our senses.\n\nThis world is a creation which I can perceive through my senses and vouch for -- it exists, the world exists. These are existences I can vouch for, and the creation is an effect. I myself am an effect; the world is an effect. So there has to be a Creator. We have come to the conclusion that there must be one Creator who created this universe, including my own self, including my own being. That Creator did not have any other source of material.\n\nHe could not buy, borrow, or steal material from any other source. Therefore, the only material available to him was his own self. He created this Jagat out of his own self, and so is my own being. Therefore, myself cannot be separate, cannot be different from his self, because the material provided for this Jagat is nothing but the Bhagavan's own self. In Sankhya philosophy, we have seen it described in a different way.\n\nPurusha and Prakriti. Purusha is the efficient cause and Prakriti is the material cause. Prakriti provides the material. Purusha is the consciousness agency which provide the efficient cause. Then we have discussed the Vedanta goes one step further. It says both the efficient cause, which is Purusha and Prakriti which is the material cause, are expression of the same entity, Brahman.\n\nThis Prakriti is created out of Maya. In appearance only -- no actual mutation took place in the self of that great Paramatma. But it appears to have mutated into this Prakriti, the world of plurality. We have understood this intellectually. If you take that argument, there is no difference between your Atma -- which you consider your consciousness, different from the Paramatma -- and the Supreme Being. Now what we are discussing is how that Supreme Being relates to the Prakriti. The last few verses we have seen are concluding verses, because in the verses before this, we saw how to recognize the Paramatma which is immutable, which is neither Sat nor Asat.\n\nSome recognize this through Dhyanam, some through Karma Yoga, some through just listening. Depending on your own capabilities, you can choose the path most appropriate for you to recognize that myself, the Atma which I consider my own being, is the same as Paramatma. Bhagavan now concludes this topic by saying: Yavat sanjayate kinchit, satvam sthavara-jangamam. Wherever you see any creation in this Jagat, know that the field and its knower have come together. Without the knower and the field coming together, there is no creation. It is like in quantum physics.\n\nThey say the particle only exists when somebody detects it. Unless there is an observer, the particle may be in the form of a probability wave. As soon as there is a detector, either individual or mechanical, the particle will manifest as a particle. So unless there is a knower, there is no field. And if there is a field, there has to be a knower of that field. The two exist in mutual existence.\n\nSo Bhagawan said, whenever there is a creation, both have to be there. Efficient cause and material cause. They both have to be present in that creation. So no O Bharatara Sabha, wherever there is creation, there are both material cause and efficient cause. Purusha Efficient cause, Prakriti material cause. However you should know.\n\nBhagavan said Samam sarveshu bhuteshu tishthantam parameshvaram -- seeing the supreme Lord equally present in all beings. Right now, because of my own Ahankar, this Aham-kartr Ahankar which says I am so unique that the paramatma in me is very unique compared to all other beings. The atma in all other beings -- dismissing the animals to be inferior, and even the worms to be inferior to anything else. So this notion that I have, this inflated evaluation of my own self, is a myth. This myth has to go away for me to recognize the paramatma. The myth which I have created in my own mind that I am unique and everybody else is just normal, that we are normal beings of this world.\n\nBut I myself is very unique. One who says the same Atma, same paramatma is atma in all beings. Vinasyatsu or Vinasyantam Yah Pasyati sah Pashyati. Right now I am seeing this world through my physical senses, through my eyes, through my understanding of my limited sense perception. The sense perception has created the conception in my mind about what the world is and what my being is. But after getting the wisdom of this reality, Bhagavan said, one who starts seeing that, that immutable imperishable paramatma which is the Purusha functioning is the knower of the field.\n\nIn each field is not different from each other or each other. Knowers in this field. So he does not see this atma to be destructible in any being. Yah Pashyati Sah Pashyati Manu sees that indestructible atma in all perishable things and beings. I see things and beings all around me which are perishable in a sense. It has beginning date and end date.\n\nOr anything that which I see in the world, including the stars and galaxies. They all have beginning date and end date. Changing the world around me is constantly changing. I myself is constantly changing. My body is changing, my mind is changing, my intellect is changing. But I am the witness of these changes in me.\n\nSo I must be different than the changes which are occurring in me the same way the world which is changing. The knower of this universe must be changeless just as I remain changeless throughout my existence as this limited being from my childhood to these old days. He said, one who sees that he is the wise person. Sammam paschenhi sarvatra sam avasthitam ishwaram na hinashyati atmanaatmanam tatoyati paramgatim. One who sees Ishwara exists pervading an all being, a same Ishwara. He does not destroy the self by by the self and therefore he achieves the higher state of existence.\n\nHe becomes one with that. We have seen this before. We Learned in chapter 6 in verse 5 Bhagawan I said uttarat atmana tmanam na tmanam ausaade. Lift yourself by yourself, don't let yourself fall. So we already learned at least six chapters ago. There are two selves in me.\n\nOne which is identified with this limited being, the limited self which is conditioned consciousness. That limited self is constantly getting the guidance from the higher self which is the paramatma. My own conscience, my own antaratma which guides me all the time. I know before I do anything whether it is right or wrong. My antaratna will tell me. My conscience will tell me whether I'm on a right path or not.\n\nI know this market is very hot and everybody is putting money in it. Maybe I should back out. But I'm not going to back out because I don't want to lose out. What if market continues to go up? Even though my antaratma said this is not the right way to go about in this market. I'll go and do it anyway.\n\nThe Bhagawan saying that you have let yourself down by your own self, not listening to the higher self. The Bhagawan has advised us that don't let your lower self fall by not listening to your higher self with constant guidance from the higher self. Because I'm always connected even though I am not aware of it. Just the conditioned space in the room is always connected with the universal space outside. There was never a division between the room space and the space outside. It is only in my mind that I see that as limited space.\n\nTherefore I call this room space. All the things which I consider the attributes of the room space are actually those attributes are of the conditioning of the room, the walls, the length, width, height, the contamination or the room is clean or dirty. I call it A room space. But what I'm describing is the conditioning of that room. The same way Bhagavan said. When I identify with this conditioning, the node of the field becomes limited.\n\nThat is the ahamkartru, the ahankar. When it reflects the consciousness, it itself think it is consciousness. That consciousness is now reflecting the limitations of the condition in the body, mind and intellect. Just as the room space is now reflecting the limitations of the room. How wide it is, how long it is, how tall it is. All those are attributes of the conditioning, not of the space.\n\nSo Bhagwante samam pashanhi sarvatra sam avasthitam Ishwaram. One who sees this Ishwara pervading all knowers of these fields. He does not destroy the higher self by the lower self. By completely identifying with the lower self, I'm literally disassociating myself from the higher self. If I completely identify myself as the body, mind, intellect and say this is it. Runam krutva gurutumbibet yavad jeevet Sukam jeevet.\n\nEven if you incur death, drink ghee, live happily. After this body is burnt, there is no coming back. So leave as comfortably as you can by whatever means. There is one type of philosophy which is Charvak Darshan, one of the schools of thought in our Indian philosophy. But once again if you are abiding to that thought then you have completely negated the existence of the higher self. You disassociated yourself with Sahara self.\n\nYou are not recognizing the existence of the higher self. That is killing your higher self by yourself identifying with the non self. This ego is not the self. This thinking entity. This thinking entity is inert and cannot think unless it is energized by the Purusha's presence, the sentience in me. But the ego starts thinking.\n\nThese are the qualities of mind. And therefore I am the Almighty for my world and I do not need any higher guidance. He says such a person kills the higher self by the lower self and he does not see the real truth. One who does not do that, he achieves the higher state of existence. Prakruti evacha Karmani Kriyamanani Sarvasah. One who sees that all actions are being performed within the Prakriti by the Prakriti and Atma.",
      "reflection": "These verses bring a sublime vision: when one perceives the diverse existence of beings as rooted in One and spreading forth from That alone (ekastham anupashyati, tata eva cha vistaram), one attains Brahman. The Supreme Self, being beginningless and without qualities (anaditvat nirgunatvat), though dwelling in the body, neither acts nor is tainted (na karoti na lipyate). Just as space, being all-pervading and subtle, is not affected by what it contains (akasham nopalipyate), so the Self, though present in all bodies, remains pure (atma nopalipyate).\n\nThe space analogy is profound and practical. Consider the space in a dirty room versus a clean room, a prison cell versus a temple. The space itself is never dirty or clean, imprisoned or sacred - these are qualities of the containers, not the space. Similarly, your awareness witnesses angry thoughts and peaceful thoughts, noble actions and ignoble actions, but awareness itself is never angry or peaceful, noble or ignoble. It simply illuminates whatever arises. Today, practice holding this recognition: \"I am like space - present everywhere in my experience, yet untouched by any experience.\"\n\nThe practical test is simple: can you be aware of a difficult emotion without becoming that emotion? Can you witness a disturbing thought without being disturbed? This is not suppression or denial - the emotion is fully felt, the thought is clearly seen - but you recognize that you are the space in which these arise, not the contents. When you truly see this, you touch the imperishable amidst the perishable, the unchanging amidst the changing."

      "commentary": "In studying the Bhagavad Gita, we have seen that it is divided into three parts describing Tattvamasi -- \"That thou art.\" \"Thou,\" that is you as you are; \"That,\" which is the Lord you are seeking. They both are one and the same. In the first six chapters, we talked about \"you\" as we are today. In the next six chapters, we talked about the identity of the Lord. But how do we reconcile that they both are one and the same? From chapter 13 onward is an explanation of how these two are one and the same.\n\nMyself and this Supreme Self are not two different selves, but just one and the same. Chapter 13 started by asking how this differentiation comes in our perception, in our understanding of \"I\" and the world -- the duality created between myself and everything other than what I consider myself. In chapter 13, we have seen Kshetra Kshetrajna Vibhaga Yoga -- the differentiation created in my understanding between the field and its knower. The differentiation right now is very clear: I am the knower of the world that I know, and the world is my field of actions. This chapter takes it one notch higher and says: Idam Shariram Kaunteya, iti Kshetram.\n\nThis which I consider as the knower right now is actually part of the field. This body is the field, and one who knows the body is the knower. So we took it to one more subtle level. The definition I know intuitively is that I am the knower and the world is my field. But now I have included my body as part of the world, and \"I,\" the knower, remains something other than this body. Then we also include the mind and intellect and all my emotions into it.\n\nAll the vikaras, the modifications of this field, all my emotions, my experiences -- all go into it. Then what is left, the one who is aware of everything, is the knower. The field is where all the activity is taking place. We have also defined it in a different way: Prakriti and Purusha. Now we know there are two entities which constitute my world. My world is the world of matter, the field in which all the activity is taking place.\n\nThe one who knows and feels the results and reactions of this activity -- at my micro-cosmic level, when I'm identified with this field, with what I consider my body, my mind, my intellect -- the one who is aware of this and identifying with it becomes the enjoyer or sufferer of the activities performed by my mind, my intellect, and my body. The same applies to all bodies, minds, and intellects.\n\nBhagavan said both the field and the knower of the field are beginningless. You can think about when this started. The question, obviously and legitimately, is: why and when?\n\nWhen did this ignorance about myself start -- the ignorance that I am not the Supreme Self? And why? The answer is given in a way that requires more contemplation. It basically says they both are beginningless. There's no beginning where one day Bhagavan says, \"Let there be Prakriti and let them suffer through it.\" They're beginningless because they are the very nature of the Lord. Both Prakriti and Purusha are the nature of the Lord, as we have seen in the previous chapter: \"My higher Prakriti and my lower Prakriti.\" My lower Prakriti is the manifest world, and my higher Prakriti is the one which supports this lower Prakriti and makes it function.\n\nIn this chapter, we have seen it in different ways. Purusha is the subtler, higher, unmanifest self. And Prakriti is the most manifest self. Both are beginningless because they are the very nature of the Supreme, the Brahman. Anything which has a cause becomes an effect. Every effect has its qualities.\n\nThese qualities make it perishable, and therefore it remains in time and space for a limited duration. As long as qualities are attributed to something, it has a cause and a timeline. But something which is beginningless obviously cannot have any qualities. Therefore Brahman does not have any qualities, and therefore it has no cause.\n\nIf there is no cause, it is beginningless. If Prakriti and Purusha are the two aspects of the Supreme, they both are beginningless. We started with this basic understanding. Then he said, if that's the case, then obviously all hands are His, all mouths are His. Anywhere or any place where a thing or a being comes into existence, it is because of the union between these two -- Prakriti and Purusha. Creation only takes place when Prakriti and Purusha, the field and its knower, come together. If there is no knower, there is no field.\n\nAnd if there is no field, there is no knower. As long as I consider myself a living being -- as long as, one, I have this body, mind, and intellect, and two, I'm aware of it. If I'm not aware of it, do I really exist? Therefore the question: do you really exist in deep sleep? I know I exist in the waking world.\n\nI know I exist in a dream as a dreamer. But do I really exist in my deep sleep? I'm not aware of myself -- or am I? I am very aware of myself even though I'm not aware of my body, mind, and intellect. Therefore I wake up and say, \"I had a good sleep.\" If I were not aware of myself, I wouldn't be able to say that.\n\nTherefore I say I exist even in my deep sleep. I exist as a waker, I exist as a dreamer, and I also exist as a deep sleeper. As this limited ego, I consider myself. Then Bhagavan takes us to the path where he says: what is knowledge and what is to be known? What is to be known is seated in the hearts of all the beings and all things.\n\nThe core of our being is our awareness about our self -- that is to be known. Who is it that is aware of my being? That which leads me to that knowledge is the knowledge. Everything else other than that is ignorance. We have seen those several qualities -- Amanitvam, Adambhitvam. Those qualities lead me to know the knowable in my heart.\n\nThose qualities will take me to knowing the Self, which will make me aware that my self is no different from yourself, herself, and himself -- it is the one Self. Once that understanding takes place, Bhagavan said, one achieves the supreme state. How can I get over my limitations? How can I be perennially happy? That state, Bhagavan said, you will achieve when you understand that this self in me is the self seated in all hearts, moving or unmoving.\n\nThat is the core, the essence of all beings. Bhagavan said that many people have recognized this Self through many different paths -- Dhyana Yoga, Karma Yoga, Jnana Yoga, Bhakti Yoga. There are various paths. People have attained knowledge about their own self and in turn gained knowledge of the Paramatma. But some may not even be capable of following any path.\n\nJust having faith in somebody's words, they have attained this. Just having that faith -- because my guru told me, or such and such person told me -- and having pursued that, they also achieved it.\n\nThe last few verses address the test: how can I consider that I have come to know this? Samam pashyan hi sarvatra, sama-avasthitam Ishwaram. One who starts seeing that the Ishwara, my Lord, is sitting equally in all hearts, is present everywhere equally -- and therefore I'm not negating the Supreme Self by my small self. Right now, I've already negated it.\n\nI only consider \"this is me.\" Nothing other than this I consider me -- \"that's not me, that's not me, that's not me.\" But once I say \"this is all me,\" I'm not negated, even though I'm aware of this limited self. I'm also aware that this extension of the world is nothing but me alone. Just as in the example we have seen, the conditioned room space was never separated from the space outside. Right now I'm aware of the conditioned space and I say, \"This is room space.\"\n\nBut if I also have the understanding that room space and space are one and the same, then I truly have knowledge of space. The last few verses expand on this idea that I'm constantly aware of both my existences -- my existence as this limited ego, the conditioned self as this body, mind, and intellect, and at the same time, my existence as the Supreme Self.\n\nThe last few verses say: Anaditvat nirgunatvat, Paramatma ayam avyayah, sharira-stho 'pi Kaunteya, na karoti na lipyate. This Paramatma, this Self at its greater level, is beginningless and devoid of all qualities. My limited self has a beginning and an end -- I was born and I will die.\n\nOr you can say wherever my ego started, many births ago. Once I realize that this conditioned self is none other than that which is beginningless and nirgunatvat -- I have all the qualities right now: nice person, not so nice. All these are qualities of my body, mind, and intellect, which I perceive one way and the world perceives another way. But He said these qualities are not the qualities of myself. These are qualities of my conditioning, the Prakriti. Prakriti, my manifest self, has the qualities.\n\nBut my real Self, which is knowing this Prakriti, has no qualities. Because, as Bhagavan said, the Self has no cause and therefore it is beginningless. And because it is beginningless and has no cause, it cannot have any qualities that make it limited. Knowing that the Paramatma is immutable, imperishable, beginningless, and quality-less -- and so is the nature of myself -- therefore, though it is seated in my heart, in this body, as the propeller for this body to perform actions, it is not doing anything.\n\nNo actions are being performed by myself. All actions are performed by the qualities of the Prakriti. In Gujarati there is a saying: \"Prana Prakriti saathe jaay\" -- the Prana and the Prakriti both go together. Nothing goes first, nothing goes later. In other words, my inherent nature will not change no matter what happens.\n\nI cannot suddenly become interested in boxing or wrestling because my inherent nature is not to be in that. Bhagavan said: Sharira-stho 'pi Kaunteya -- even though it seems he is seated in this heart and propelling this body, mind, and intellect to act, the acts are only performed by this body, mind, and intellect and belong to them alone. As long as the conditioned self is identifying with them, it suffers and enjoys. When that identification is removed, there is no suffering or enjoyment because of the actions of this body. Therefore he says: Na karoti -- he is not doing anything. Na lipyate -- he is not affected by it.\n\nThe next verse says: Yatha sarvagatam saukshmat, akasham na upalipyate, sarvatra avasthito dehe, tatha atma na upalipyate. Just as space -- and I use this analogy very conveniently as an architect -- because of its subtle nature, space is never tainted. It says Akasha, space, is all-pervading yet never affected.",
      "reflection": "The chapter concludes with a powerful analogy and promise: \"As the one sun illuminates the entire world, so the Lord of the field illuminates the entire field\" (yatha prakashayaty ekah kritsnam lokam imam ravih, kshetram kshetri tatha kritsnam prakashayati). Just as one sun lights up all objects without being affected by what it illuminates, so the one Consciousness lights up all experiences in all beings. Those who perceive with the eye of wisdom (jnana-chakshusha) the difference between Field and Knower, and know the liberation of beings from Prakriti, attain the Supreme (yanti te param).\n\nThis solar analogy deserves deep contemplation. The sun does not choose what to illuminate - it shines equally on palaces and slums, on saints and sinners. Your awareness is similar: it illuminates every thought, every sensation, every emotion without discrimination. The sun does not become the objects it lights; awareness does not become the experiences it illuminates. Spend time today with this recognition: there is a light in you that has illuminated every experience of your life, yet has never been changed by any experience. This light is your true nature.\n\nThe final verse gives the key to liberation: see with wisdom the difference between Field and Knower (kshetra-kshetrajnayor evam antaram). This entire chapter has been preparing you for this discernment. As a concluding practice for this chapter, sit quietly and review: What is my field? My body, senses, mind, emotions, thoughts, memories, identifications. Who is the Knower? That which is aware of all these yet is none of these. Rest in this discrimination. This is not mere philosophy; it is \"bhuta-prakriti-moksham\" - the liberation of your being from the bondage of matter. Those who know this, says Krishna, attain the Supreme."

      "commentary": "We have completed chapter 13 and started discussing chapter 14. So in the last chapter we have very exhaustively discussed the relationship of the nature and the knower of the Nature, the Prakriti and Purusha, the field and its knower, that we have seen that both are Anadi, both are beginningless. But all these activities take place in Prakriti. The self remains inactive, it becomes a witness, but its very presence makes it possible. All the activities, this field and its Knower, when come together, then only a creation comes into place. If there is a field but there is no knower, or the knower but there is no field, both cannot exist because field of the Knower only exists because there is a field and the field only exists because the Knower is there.\n\nSo this superimposition of the field on its knower creates this world of plurality as we know it. But it never really explained to us why this plurality -- in other words, why this variety. We know that the Prakriti is beginningless. We know the Purusha is beginningless. There is no difference in Prakriti here or Prakriti there, no difference between over here and over there.\n\nThen what is it that causes all this world of plurality, the variations and modifications that we see -- that I am different from you, and you are different from the next person? This chapter deals with that aspect. Prakriti is all-pervading and everywhere, and so is the Knower. But it is the qualities of this Prakriti that create this variety, as we know. So this chapter, the Yoga of Gunas, now talks about the nature of Prakriti. We have seen that there is no activity taking place in the Knower, the self. All the activities, all the Karmas, are the cause and the effect of Prakriti. The very nature of things and beings creates this activity and this variety.\n\nSo that will be discussed in this chapter. The chapter opens with Lord Krishna's declaration one more time. As he has done many times before, he says parambhuyaha pravakshami Gnananam Gnanamuttamam -- I'm going to tell you, I shall again declare to you the supreme knowledge, Gnananam Gnanamuttam, the best among all knowledge. What it really means is that we need to constantly keep repeating what is important, what is real and what is unreal. In the last chapter, in a very broad brush, we have seen that how we can disassociate ourselves as the knower from the field that included my body, mind and intellect. That was the paradigm shift for us, that this body, mind and intellect is part of the field. One who knows this body, mind and intellect is the knower of this field.\n\nThat knower is the self. That self is pervading equally among all the beings. However, it never explained -- if that's the case, if the knower is the same, pervading everywhere -- why there is a variety, why I am who I am and you are who you are. So this chapter says, if I know why I am who I am right now, if I have a guide to analyze my own self, I can introspect and say: what makes me who I am? At times I'm a nice person, at times I'm a very angry man.\n\nAnd at times I'm not so nice. What makes me nice or not so nice at various times? If I can have a guide to use as a path to introspect myself, maybe I will have a better chance to understand myself as I exist as the jiva, as the individual ego -- and then can transcend that individual ego to identify with the self which is all-pervading in all of us. Therefore, this knowledge is the most important knowledge among all the knowledges, because it allows you to introspect your own self.\n\nYat gnatva munayha sarve param siddham ita gataha. Anytime you have to sell something to somebody, you have to make sure that there is proof.\n\nYou can't say that nobody has ever heard this before -- you are the first guinea pig I'm going to try this out on, and let's see if it works. This knowledge was used by many munis. Yat gnatva -- knowing this knowledge, they attain the param siddhim, the highest supreme achievement. The phrase \"after going from here\" is sometimes complex and can be misleading.\n\nIf you don't read between the lines, the first phrase is \"ita gathaha\" -- after going from here. So we might come to the conclusion that this knowledge will be only beneficial after I die, that while I'm here, it may not be possible for me to gain that knowledge. Then \"yad ginatva munay ha\" -- all the Munis who, knowing this, have achieved the supreme state. And we all know that we started out by asking, what is the supreme state?\n\nWe are looking for the supreme state where there is no limitation. For me, I am right now suffering from my limitations. I want to get out of these limitations so that I can have eternal bliss. So am I qualified for this? And this verse can be misguiding when it says \"munihi sarve\" -- so we think this knowledge is only for the Munis.\n\nOur picture of a Muni is, as Swamiji says, a guy who is in his 70s and 80s, somewhere in the Himalayas with a white beard, surviving on just whatever he can gather. Nothing to do with the world. But Swamiji tried to explain to us that a Muni is one who is contemplating within his mind. One who is contemplating about the self in his own mind is a Muni. One who is a seeker of this knowledge is a Muni. As this knowledge becomes more and more clear to him -- yad gatva -- as this knowledge becomes clearer to him, he gets closer and closer to his goal.\n\nOnce this knowledge becomes his own, he achieves that final state where there are no limitations. Itaha kathaha -- after having gone from here. \"Gone from here\" means from this state of my understanding that this is me, that this body, mind and intellect is me, and the workings of my body and mind are my doings, and I am the enjoyer and sufferer. Once that understanding has changed -- that body, mind and intellect are part of the field, and I am just the observer who makes this body, mind, and intellect function.\n\nSo Itah kath -- going from this stage of identifying with the conditioned individualized ego, which we have seen in the field and its knower. The knower which identifies with the field becomes the individualized ego. The knower which identifies with my body, my mind, my intellect becomes me, the jiva. Once that identification is detached and I see myself as every other self, I become free from that. Itha gath -- the Munis have come to understand this.\n\nThe next verse says Idam gnanam upashitya mama sa Dharmyam Agathah. So we have two entities right now in our understanding.\n\nOne is me, who is eternally suffering -- because anytime I think I have achieved what I want, something else comes along that is higher than that. Something gets out of my control. I think I have control of all the situations, then suddenly something gets out of control. We figure out everything is going right.\n\nAnd suddenly we hear that our son is not doing well. Somehow I make sure that side is taken care of. Then we figure out the economy has shifted. We try to manage things within our control, but constantly something is getting out of our control. Then we know that there is someone who has control over everything, one who never has to worry about anything.\n\nHe doesn't have to compete for jobs with anybody. He is the Lord of all these beings. This creates a complete division -- I and him are separate. But my goal is to constantly become him, because my goal is to become without any limitations, without any sorrows.\n\nSo I'm constantly trying to go from what I am to what he is. And Bhagavan says, Idam Gnanam Upashatya -- one who has taken refuge in this knowledge. The knowledge which he has not given us yet, but he's going to give it to us. He has given us a broad brush understanding of how things work. But how to get from here to there, we don't know yet.\n\nBut he says, idam Gnanam Upasatya mama sa Dharma Agathah. One who has taken refuge in the knowledge, they become one with me. Their dharmas have become what my dharmas are. My dharmas are limited. Right now his dharmas are unlimited. From this limitedness to unlimitedness, Bhagavan said, those munis who have understood this knowledge and became one with that knowledge have become one with me.\n\nSadharamyam Agatha API na upa jayante Pralayena Vihanticha. This is a broad statement for somebody like us who is worried about the next paycheck. It says that they do not take birth even at the time of creation. We are saying, look, forget about the creation and Pralaya -- I am worried about what's happening tomorrow. But he says, there's such a person Sargiya Pina upa Jayante Pralay na Vyatanti character.\n\nAnd he doesn't get destroyed at the time of Pralaya. Because we are also pretty long term planners. So we say, okay, I mean I do all of that. But then again I'll take a birth and I'll go back to the same thing all over again. I'll realize that I'm that unlimited being. But then I'll take a birth again and then I'll start from scratch all over again.\n\nBhagavan said, no -- once you have realized who you are, there is no birth or death for you. Then you might ask, if everybody realizes this, obviously there is no creation and there is no Pralaya, so why are we going through all of this? He says, this is self-knowledge. This is for you to get out of the misery which you are going through. You are not worried about what the others are doing.\n\nWe are not taking over his job of creating and destroying. I am only concerned about me. If the job market is bad and we have 10 of our friends who are out of a job, including yourself, who are you most worried about getting a job for? Yourself, right? Good luck to all of you, but once I get a job, I'm alright. Others may be doing whatever they are doing. Bhagavan may have whatever goal he has in this cycle of creation and dissolution.\n\nI need to get out of this misery. The one who has understood this will never have to take birth again or die again.\n\nSwamiji explains this in a logical, philosophical manner. He says the world keeps on going the way it is, but I understand that this Prakriti is an illusion.\n\nThe creation is a trick of my mind. If there is a lump of clay or Play-Doh, I make the shape myself and assign value to it -- that it is a doll, or it's an elephant, or whatever it is. Nothing has changed in the clay itself. But my mind has now assigned a value that it's a creation created by me and I have given a name and form to it. Now if I don't assign the name and form to it and keep seeing the clay as it is, there is no creation taking place.\n\nNow when I take that clay elephant I made and destroy it back into a lump of clay, that elephant is destroyed. If I had taken credit for that creation and assigned a name and form to it, then yes, something was destroyed. But if I never assigned a name and form to it, it has remained what it was before -- a lump of clay. Prakriti remaining Prakriti, and Purusha remaining Purusha.",
      "reflection": "These opening verses reveal a profound truth: the same Supreme Knowledge (jnananam jnanam uttamam) that liberated the ancient sages is available to you right now. Krishna declares that those who truly understand this teaching attain \"mama sadharmyam\"—they become one with the Divine nature itself, beyond the cycle of creation and dissolution. Consider today: What would it mean to know yourself not as this body, mind, and intellect, but as the eternal witness? The teaching tells us that Prakriti (Nature) is the cosmic womb and Purusha (Spirit) is the seed-giving father—together they produce all beings. You are that union of the manifest and unmanifest.\n\nReflect on the clay and elephant analogy from the teaching: when you mold clay into an elephant shape, the clay never changes—only your perception assigns name and form. Similarly, the world of plurality you experience is your mind's creation upon the unchanging Brahman. Today, practice seeing past the \"elephant\" to the \"clay\"—look at the objects, people, and situations around you and ask: What is the unchanging substratum beneath all these changing forms? When you truly see that all variety arises from the same source, the fear of birth and death naturally dissolves. What \"names and forms\" are you most attached to? Can you begin to see the one consciousness that animates all?"

      "reflection": "These verses introduce the three gunas—Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas—as the fundamental qualities that bind the imperishable Self to the perishable body. Krishna states clearly: \"nibadhnanti mahābāho dehe dehinam avyayam\"—these gunas fetter the free Spirit in all beings. Yet here is the subtle trap revealed in verse 6: even Sattva, the most luminous and pure quality, creates bondage through \"sukhasangena\" (attachment to happiness) and \"jnanasangena\" (attachment to knowledge). Notice today how your pursuit of clarity, health, and understanding—all sattvic qualities—can themselves become chains. Do you cling to your \"good\" states? Do you feel superior when you are clear-headed and peaceful?\n\nThe teaching reveals that you are the Divine Father's seed planted in Nature's womb—\"aham bijapradah pita.\" Every being, regardless of their apparent form or station, shares this sacred origin. Today, look at every person you encounter and recognize them as your sibling, born of the same cosmic parents. More practically, use these verses as a diagnostic tool: When you feel light, clear, and healthy, recognize Sattva at work. But ask yourself—am I attached to this pleasant state? The goal is not to maximize Sattva but to recognize the witness who observes all three gunas without being bound by any. What would it feel like to appreciate happiness without grasping it?"

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 14, Gunatraya Vibhaga Yoga, the Yoga of Trigunas. We had just completed the Kshetrakshatragna Vibhaga, the differentiation between the field and its knower. We have seen that this world of ours is made up of two things. One is the field and its knower. In my case, I the knower of my world. And then we have also seen at the macro level, it's a Purusha and Prakriti, two entities which makes this manifest world apparent to me.\n\nPrakriti is the nature, the manifest world, and Purusha is the unmanifestation which is making this Prakriti animated. So this understanding of Purusha and Prakriti -- now we can use it to our advantage. As Bhagawan says, we can only understand it if we know the nature of this Prakriti. Prakriti, even in our vernacular language, refers to anybody's inherent qualities and nature -- that's his Prakriti. Also in Gujarati they say -- I'm sure it's in other languages too.\n\nPranayani, Prakruti, Sathya Jay, that this breath and my quality, they go together, they remain embedded in me. So knowing this Prakriti can certainly be a big help in my spiritual quest of knowing myself. So this chapter talks about Gunatraya, the three Gunas of the Prakriti. Prakriti is me as this body, mind and intellect. This world as I see it is all-pervading, just as the nature of Brahman is. And as we have said, both the Purusha and Prakriti are beginningless because both are the nature of Brahman, which is beginningless.\n\nSomething which is beginningless in whatever format it is presented remains beginningless. Therefore, Prakriti is beginningless. Purusha is beginningless. In my quest of understanding myself, myself is beginningless. Where did I create this misunderstanding that I'm limited and I'm going through these ups and downs in my life? I'm Going through these sorrows and happiness, the spurts of little happiness and then long period of pursuit of happiness.\n\nBhagavan said that understanding this nature of this Prakriti will be helpful. Bhagawan said, I am the Mahat Yoni Brahman. I, the Brahman in the form of a Prakriti is the womb of all the beings. No being or thing can come into existence unless the Purusha and Prakriti come together. So see, anywhere you see a thing or being coming into existence, consider that as the union of the Purusha and Prakarati, that unmanifest and manifest coming together creates a new creation. Wherever there is a birth taking place, consider that it is coming from my womb, the universal womb.\n\nAnd then you say, I am the Sid giver, Father. Prakriti is the womb and Purusha is the father. Therefore, in our all vernacular language is Mother Nature, Mother Earth. And Bhagavan is Pita. Bhagavan is my father. Prakriti is my mother, comes directly from this verse from Bhagavad Gita.\n\nSo this nature, Mother Nature, when it comes to me, creates this body, mind and intellect. When I was born, what I was born with is this body, which continues to grow and decay. I was born with this mind and intellect, which at the rudimentary level grew into who I think I am today. If I know the nature of this Prakriti, it will help me understand who I am. So the next three verses tell us the nature of Prakriti. Swattam Rajah, Tama, iti, Gunaha, Prakriti, Sambhavah.\n\nThe three Gunas which we see in this world, in almost everything that we can observe, are Sattva, rajas and Tamas. They are born out of Prakriti. This manifest world becomes manifest because of these Gunas. Take these three gunas away and there is no world -- only the unmanifest remains. So what is the first? Sattva -- purity, awareness, knowledge, luminosity.\n\nA thing comes into existence for me when I become aware of it. We went on a cruise about two years ago and realized at the last minute that we needed some cash. So I went to the ATM, but it was Sunday and my car just wouldn't work. So I finally called my client in Baltimore -- Mike, can you have $300 in cash for me? I'll give you a check when I come there. So anyway, he had three crisp $100 notes ready for me in an envelope. I went there, collected it, gave him a check and went on the cruise. We never used that money. It was sealed in that envelope when we came back, and we forgot all about it. Those $300 never existed for us for all this time.\n\nBecause we had forgotten about it. Then one day we opened it -- $300 in it. We are suddenly $300 richer. They did not exist for us until then. Then one day Mina said, I gave you that $200. What did you do with it?\n\nWell I said I have it. I'll give it back to you if you want. That money came into existence when I became aware of it, when Mina became aware of it. Till that time it did not exist. Sattvam -- unless you are aware of this world, the world does not come into existence for you.\n\nSo it is for her, for him, and everybody else. When we all become unaware of this world, it ceases to exist for us. So Sattva is the first quality of Prakriti. In this nature, we are aware of each other and therefore we exist for each other. Next is Rajas and third is Tamas. We have heard it many, many times before.\n\nBut he said they are Prakriti Sambhavah. These gunas are born out of Prakriti. My Prakriti is that I become aware of my world. This experience of this world creates passion and desires in me. Passion creates desire, desire creates actions, actions create reactions. And my world continues with cause and effect.\n\nSomebody comes and says you should be investing money right now because the market is down. Then suddenly my desire to make money kicks in -- Neel, you need to do something! And I start doing things. That creates another chain reaction when the market drops. So Rajas is the activity which is the nature of cause and effect. My interaction with this Prakriti, because of my passion, creates activity.\n\nThis activity creates the experience of joys and sorrows. I pat my back and say I'm so smart -- when everybody was thinking this way, I was doing that. Then when things go bad, I say, well, people really cheated me, they should have told me. And then Tamas -- inertia. If we don't have inertia, we don't even exist.\n\nFor something to exist in time and space, it has to have inertia. It has to remain in that condition in time and space for others to experience it. I am real because I have inertia -- I remain in that state in time and space for others to experience me. So the inertia is the essential part of Prakriti. Tamas is the very essential quality of Prakriti.\n\nJust as Sattva and rajas. If you take one of the three out, Prakriti does not exist. Sattva cannot exist if there is no rajas and Tamas. There is nothing to be aware of. Rajas cannot exist if there is no inertia. But because there is inertia, Tamas, all three continue to work with each other.\n\nSo this Tamas is the nature of inertia, which at my level I relate to as my sleep, deep sleep. When I really don't want to do anything, somebody says, oh, let's go and have a party. Forget about it, I'm not in the mood today -- I'm overwhelmed by Tamas. If I'm very sleepy and you tell me to do something, forget about it. Right now all I want to do is sleep.\n\nThat means I am overwhelmed by Tamas, and all I want to do is go back to my basic nature. Iti Gunaha Prakruti Sambhavaha -- they are part of Prakriti. They are the nature of Prakriti, embedded into it. Swamiji says they are not like qualities of a material where you can say, if I test in the lab I will find Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas. They are actually the moods of my mind when I interact with this Prakriti.\n\nSo sometimes my mind is overwhelmed by Sattva. Things start getting clearer to me. I tried very hard yesterday, couldn't figure it out. This morning it suddenly came to me -- an aha moment, a Eureka moment. That is predominant Sattva. Then Rajas -- now I've figured out, I need to do something. And Tamas -- this is enough.\n\nI need to go to sleep. There is always a time -- no matter how dynamic a person is, he has to take rest. Ithiguna Prakritisam Nibadnanti Mahabhaho Dehe Dehi nam Avyayaam -- this imperishable self, the Purusha, the Brahman which is imperishable, is now bound by this perishable body through these three gunas. The Purusha comes in contact with the Prakriti and gets attached to it. So this dehi in me, my consciousness which is of all-pervading, imperishable nature -- once it attaches to this body, mind and intellect and enjoys the gunas, it gets bound.\n\nSo now I consider this is me, the body; this is me, the intellect. This is only possible because the consciousness tells me that's who I am. This imperishable one is now bound in this body by these three gunas. Tatra satvam nirmalatva Prakasakam anamayam Sukha sangena badnati gnana sangena cha anagaha -- my mind, under the influence of these three gunas, binds me to this body, this mind, and this intellect.\n\nSo what is the nature of it? Now I want to unbound myself so that I can realize my imperishable self. That's the quest we have. So that I will have infinite happiness, unlimited happiness which I'm seeking. So I have to unbound myself. So I have to see what is binding me and how.\n\nSo the first is Sattva. Tatra Sattva nirmalatva Prakashakam annamayam. The nature of Sattva is prakashakam -- suddenly things become clearer to me. Before I walk into this room at night, it's dark. Nothing is clear about what's in the room. Suddenly I switch the light on.\n\nEverything becomes completely clear because it is luminous. That's the nature of Sattva in my chitta, in my mind. When Sattva prevails, things start getting clearer to me. So it's the nature of luminosity. And annamayam -- eat some sattvic food. You tell Panditji this: the pure ghee, you know, cholesterol and all -- that's good for you, that's Sattva.\n\nSo purity is of the nature of health. When I am completely in tune with myself, I feel healthy and I feel aware. Everything seems nice, which is the experience of happiness and joy. That's what binds me to this Prakriti.\n\nWhen I feel I am in command and I understand things, I am enjoying this knowledge. When I learn something, it binds me to knowledge and the happiness of getting knowledge. Sukha sangena badnati -- it binds me to happiness. Gnana sangena cha anagaha.\n\nSattva binds me to knowledge and happiness. It's still a bondage. No matter how golden the chain is, it's still a bondage. Therefore, many other saints have argued about this. The Vedantin says this, and we say harina janato Muktina magya. Whoever among the Gujarati fellows can understand -- he says God's people do not want this liberation.\n\nThey want birth after birth. So that I enjoy your bhakti. Because if I'm not there, how can I enjoy your bhakti? Therefore Harina Jina Muktina Mangi Mangi Jana Vi Janavata. I want birth after birth so that I can devote myself to you. Bondage to this Sattva?\n\nThis experience of my devotion to my Lord is giving me happiness and ecstasy. I don't want to give it up. Just keep me in this state. Don't take me to the next one. Otherwise I will lose this ecstasy. This is bondage to Sattva, even for a man of dynamic personality who worked 18 hours a day.",
      "reflection": "These verses expose the mechanics of Rajas and Tamas with surgical precision. Rajas is \"ragātmakam\"—born of passionate attachment—and binds through \"trishna\" (thirst) and \"karma-sangena\" (attachment to action). How often do you feel compelled to act, to achieve, to acquire? That restless drive is Rajas at work. Tamas, born of ignorance, binds through \"pramada\" (heedlessness), \"alasya\" (laziness), and \"nidra\" (sleep). Verse 9 summarizes beautifully: Sattva attaches you to happiness, Rajas to action, and Tamas—by covering knowledge—attaches you to heedlessness. Today, trace your actions back to their source: Are you acting from clarity, compulsion, or avoidance?\n\nThe teaching uses the example of forgotten money—$300 sealed in an envelope that \"did not exist\" until awareness revealed it. This illustrates Sattva's essential nature: things come into existence for you only when you become aware of them. Similarly, the whole world exists for you only through your awareness. But notice also the Rajasic trap described: setting a goal of $100,000, achieving it, yet still remaining unsatisfied, always chasing the next thing. Today, examine one goal you are pursuing: Is it Sattva seeking knowledge, Rajas seeking endless activity, or Tamas seeking escape? Can you find the witness who observes all three without being pulled by any? Remember—even the bliss of devotion (as the teaching notes about those who seek \"birth after birth\" to enjoy bhakti) is a form of bondage."

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 14, Gunatraya Vibhaga Yoga. So we have seen so far that these three gunas are born out of Prakriti. They are actually the nature of Prakriti. The nature gets it from Maya, as Vedanta says. Then Bhagavan Sankaratabodha says three Gunatmika Maya. This Maya has three gunas.\n\nThat which is not but appears to be -- that is Maya. So this Maya, which creates the illusion that this world is real, does so through these three qualities which bind our mind. How do we see a hologram? The question is, is the hologram real? A hologram has its own reality. However, it is not what it appears to be.\n\nIf I see a hologram of a woman, hologram is real, but the woman is not. So from that perspective, is this Prakriti real? Prakriti is very real, but it is not what it appears to be. We have all learnt in physics by this time that the atom which appears to be solid and no real solid matter in it whatsoever, but it is very real from my perspective because it is a relative reality. So Bhagavan says in this chapter that all the beings which are born in this world are basically are born from the womb of Mother Nature, Prakriti. And I, this consciousness, I, the self, supreme self, Purusha is, is the seed giving father.\n\nThe entire Prakriti and entire creation that we know is born of the same entity, the self. The Purusha is the father and the Prakriti. The nature as we know is the mother. This Prakriti has three gunas which bind the Purusha into the Prakriti. This union between the Prakriti and Purusha happens because of the three gunas in the Prakriti. And when that occurs, a being is born.\n\nAn ego is conditioned. Consciousness is conditioned, as we have seen in this analogy, a room space. When a building is built, it binds this space into it and the association creates a room Space. The same way Bhagavan said Purusha came in contact with Prakriti, a conditioned ego is born. Three gunas we have seen is Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. Classic classification we heard over and over again.\n\nSattva is the nature of purity, light, knowledge, illumination, Rajas activity, passion, attachment and Tamas, ignorance, inertia. And then we have seen how each one binds this consciousness, which is pure and pristine in its nature. Once it comes in association with the Prakriti, it binds itself to the Prakriti and creates a new conditioned being. So verses 9, 10 and 11 give us this relationship. Sattva binds you to happiness. This embodied one, this consciousness which feels embodied in myself, is bound by the nature of this field. We have seen this field -- Idam sariram Kshetram ITI abhidhya.\n\nThis body is the field. This field, with its three qualities, binds the consciousness in me. Sattva binds through happiness -- something happens, I figure it out, I come to know, I enjoy that experience. Rajas binds through activity -- the passion, the attachment creates desires, creates activity. And the more I do, the more I achieve, the more I get bound. More and more I do, as I'll give an example.\n\nWhen I left India, I had one very clear goal: if I make a hundred thousand rupees, I'll go back to India and start practicing architecture there. In Ahmedabad, I made a hundred thousand rupees long, long, long ago. I'm still outside India. Rajas binds you to activity -- the more we do, the more I want to do. And then Tamas -- ignorance, inertia. All three are absolutely necessary for this Prakriti to exist.\n\nJust as whatever ingredients bind the hologram into a form which I perceive must be there, so the next three verses summarize what we have already seen. Sattva sukhe Sanjayati Rajah Karmani Bharata Gnanam avrutya tu tamah pramade sanjayatu. Sattva binds to happiness and pleasure. Rajas binds to actions. And this knowledge about the self -- the very fact that I call myself \"I,\" but I'm not aware of what that is, I can't define it. As we have seen in this example: everything I use to define myself turns out to be something related to myself, but not me. My name, my relationship, my profession, my achievements, my losses -- whatever that is, it's not me. What is it that does not let me figure out who I am?\n\nTamas. Gnanam Avritya tu Tamah Pramade Sanjayati -- by pramad, heedlessness. My own self tells me who I am, but this pramada, this heedlessness, says no, it cannot be. Swamiji used to say, I come here every year. Because when Swamiji was alive, he used to come every year to the United States for Yagna. Some of us were standard devotees -- we were always there.\n\nHe said, I'm glad that you guys are not listening to me. I come here, give you my knowledge, and on the last day I gather it and go back. That way you keep me in business -- because otherwise, once you understood, you'd have no need for me. This Tamas -- even though we hear, even though we understand, even though our conscience tells us this should be right, we say, \"But I don't think so, because not everybody else is doing it.\"\n\nSo we get deluded by that -- Tamas, Pramade Sanjayati. So here is how he says that pure consciousness is bound into the Prakriti. Now, further analysis of how these three gunas work. These three gunas are inherent in all of Prakriti. Tamas is not a negative quality of Prakriti -- it is the very essential nature of Prakriti.\n\nFor an atom to remain in solid state, for me to recognize the atom, atom has to have certain inertia in it for me to see it as an atom. If I can start seeing it as electron and proton and neutron, the world will disappear because there is no solid matter around. So the inertia, the Tamas is the essential quality of Prakriti. So is the rajas and so is the Sattva. Because we have tendency to classify with the higher, lower and middle. So we say, well, this is higher, this is lower.\n\nFor Prakriti there is nothing like higher or lower. But what really matters is the right balance. How does one particular quality of this Maya bind me? Rajas Tamah Abhi Bhuyam Satvam Bhavati Bharata. One guna may be predominant at any given time, and the other two will be subsidiary. How we recognize a thing or being depends on what the predominant quality is.\n\nFor example, yesterday Sanchan -- normally he's a very nice guy, but I don't know what happened to him yesterday. In other words, normally he has this predominance of being nice, but once in a while the not-being-nice predominates. Any guna can obviously have predominance over the others. When Sattva predominates over Rajas and Tamas, then the experience of Sattva happens. Right now, if I want to understand something, I focus on it, I close all my activity down.\n\nThen the knowledge takes place, and we say Sattva is predominating -- everything is now clear to me. Raja satvam tamasteva tamah sattvam rajasthadha. Each one, when it predominates the others, makes that quality more apparent. We may have any dish, and if there is more salt, we'll say it's a salty dish. There may be a little sugar in it and all other things.\n\nBut whatever is predominating, we call it that -- it's salty, it's sweet. Even a sweet dish has lots of other ingredients and other tastes in it. At times Sattva predominates, at times Rajas, and at times Tamas -- in all beings, at least in human beings. Our mind, associating with the Prakriti, picks up whatever qualities attach most, and that's what defines our experience. All of us go to downtown Richmond and we come back and describe it.\n\nAll of us will have different description. Somebody like me will say, you know, the buildings are like this. Each one will come back with a different impression. Because it is my mind associating with it, my mind experiencing this world of objects. Whatever the qualities I pick up is what my mind predominates. There are times when I'll be dominated with Sattva.\n\nThere are times rajas, there are times tamas. But the other two at that time are existing in a subsidiary role. And the next verses tell us what happens -- and when I should recognize that I am under the influence of Sattva. Sarva dwareshu dehe asmin prakash upajayate -- if there's a light coming out of all the gates of my body. The navadvare puree dehi -- the body has nine gates. Basically we're talking about sense perception, the gnanendriya, the five senses of perception.\n\nOut of all these five gnanindriya, when there is a light of knowledge emitting, then I should know that gnanam yada tada vidya vibruddham satvam ITI uta. I'm seeing clearly, I'm hearing clearly, I'm tasting the right things -- when I'm having the experience of knowledge, the experience of light, then it is indeed the experience of Sattva. It may be known that Sattva is predominant. There are times we are very clear about everything -- there is no confusion in our mind, no strong passion or desire to act, but simply to know. This is fairly logical, and we all have experienced that.\n\nSomebody says, Neel, I waved at you so many times when I was passing by, but you didn't acknowledge me. Oh, I didn't see you. My eye was not having any experience of knowledge -- in other words, the mind wasn't there, and there was no way to acknowledge what I was seeing. All spouses know this. Meena will get mad and say, I don't like the insult.\n\nShe says, I've been telling you for the last two minutes and you're not paying attention. No, no, I was paying attention, but I was doing something. It happens to me almost three or four times a week. Because my mind is somewhere else, she's continually telling me what happened, and then after about two minutes she realizes, I don't think he listens to anything that I say. No knowledge is taking place.\n\nSo that's not Sattva. That's obviously my passion for something taking my mind away. And it is so important for my mind to be there in everything. Once in a while I miss the verses which I chant, because within that fraction of a second my mind goes someplace else while I'm chanting, and I'm desperately seeking which verse I was on. Each verse ends with Guru Venama -- was I on the second verse?\n\nWas I on Guru Vai Namah, the third verse, or Guru Veh Namah? Because for a fraction of a second your mind lost it, lost the connection. If that happens, it's not Sattva which is chanting -- it is Rajas that predominated, because something took over. Lo Baha Pravruti Arambha -- now this is a very Indian concept, because it's difficult for any Westerner to understand Pravritti Arambha. The urge to start something, to initiate action -- that's not Sattva. Karmanam Asamaha Spriha Rajasya Jayante Vivruddhe Bharata -- these arise when Rajas is predominant.\n\nIf this is happening, remember -- Bhagavan said, I'm going to give you this knowledge which is so profound that, having known it, you will get rid of all your bondage and liberate yourself. Here is what he's telling us: how to diagnose yourself, what your situation is. Otherwise, my mind constantly tells me, \"Neel is a very nice guy. He's a very Sattvic person.\" But he said, you have to do self-diagnosis, and you have to do it this way.\n\nThe first sign is that there is knowledge coming out of all the gates. It didn't say only one gate or the other -- all the gates.",
      "reflection": "These verses reveal a crucial insight: the gunas are constantly competing for dominance. \"Rajas tamash cha abhibhuya sattvam bhavati\"—Sattva prevails only by overcoming Rajas and Tamas, and likewise each guna rises by suppressing the others. This is not a static battle but a dynamic interplay happening moment to moment in your mind. Verse 11 gives a powerful diagnostic: \"sarvadvāreshu dehe asmin prakāśa upajāyate\"—when light (knowledge) streams through ALL the gates of your body (the senses), then Sattva is predominant. Notice the emphasis on ALL gates—partial clarity is not true Sattva. When you are truly sattvic, your seeing, hearing, tasting, touching, and smelling all convey clear knowledge.\n\nThe teaching illustrates this with everyday examples: waving to someone who doesn't acknowledge you, speaking to a spouse who doesn't hear, losing track of which verse you're chanting. These lapses reveal that your mind has been pulled elsewhere—Rajas or Tamas has taken over. Verse 12 lists the symptoms of Rajas: \"lobhah\" (greed), \"pravritti\" (the urge to act), \"ārambhah\" (initiating actions), \"aśamah\" (restlessness), and \"spriha\" (desire). Today, conduct an honest self-diagnosis: When do ALL your senses convey clear knowledge? When do you find yourself compulsively starting new projects or feeling unable to rest? Remember—this is not about judging yourself but about developing viveka (discrimination). The one who can accurately diagnose which guna is predominant is already beginning to stand apart from all three."

      ],
      "commentary": "We had been discussing Gunatraya Vibhaga Yoga, Yoga of the three gunas. We have concluded that these are the qualities of Prakriti. These three gunas make the Prakriti what it is. These three gunas come from Maya. Ishwara, in control of Maya, creates Prakriti through Maya. That which is not then appears to be there.\n\nThis world of plurality appears to be there. In reality, there is only singularity exist. This Maya creates this Prakriti by three gunas, the Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. So everything in this Prakriti has these three gunas. If you take the basic building block of our universe as the atom, the atom obviously has inertia. It has activity, and it has some awareness.\n\nFrom my perspective, the atom remains in its space and time because of inertia. If the atom doesn't remain in space and time, there's nothing you can do about it. We also know that even though it looks inactive, it has extreme activity inside -- the electron swirling around the neutron or proton within the nucleus. So there is Rajas, and there is Tamas, which is inertia. Tamas keeps the atom in its shape and its existence in space and time. The atom also knows what to do when another atom comes in contact with it, which creates this Prakriti.\n\nSo right from the basic building block to ourselves, these three gunas are existent. We obviously are not really concerned about the Prakruti as the universe right now. We are concerned about the Gunas which are manifesting in my internal instrument. Because the goal of my spiritual quest, as we all learned over and over and over again, is cleansing my internal instrument, which is the mind and intellect. This mind and intellect, when in action, will obviously manifest one guna or another as more predominant.\n\nMy mind and intellect is nothing but the impressions of my experiences and the transactions in this world. This experience, living its impression, will either make my thoughts more Satwik, more Rajasic, or more Tamasic. Under the sway of these experiences with the world outside, my internal instrument is constantly transforming from one predominance to another. And that's where we have seen why we should be aware of these gunas. Once I understand how my mind comes under the sway of these gunas, I may be able to train my mind in a manner that will be more beneficial in my spiritual evolution -- in my journey from this limited being to the unlimited being.\n\nAnd therefore we are also concerned that this life is not long enough.\n\nI'm trying to attain something but my body doesn't give cooperation and it falls apart prematurely when I have not achieved my goal. The verses we have been seeing say this is a continuity. This life is nothing but one link in a chain -- the continuity of links which is your existence. And as this limited being, my existence is more at the subtle instrument level than at the external instrument level. This external instrument will die and perish when it has run its course. The internal instrument will continue.\n\nIt has gathered experience from the past lives, gathering experience in this life and will continue into the next. So the question is, what happens when I leave this body? The last three verses deal with that. And as Swamiji says, Hinduism is the only faith that very systematically deals with the afterlife -- whereas most other faiths and most other schools of thought in this world do accept that there is a life after this life. So the verses you have seen address: what happens?\n\nWhat will be my destination when I leave this station of life? The first verse says, what happens if my mind is in a sattvic mood? Yada sattve pravruddhe tu pralayam yati deha bhrit -- uttama vidam lokan amalan pratipadyate. If my mind is in a sattvic mood of predominance at the time of my leaving, I will reach the world of the highest. I will go to an environment which will aid my journey from this limited being, the Jiva, to the higher being.\n\nSo what happens at the time of my death? I may be comatose, I may be in pain, so my mind cannot consciously think about anything.\n\nBut remember what happens when you go to deep sleep. Last night when you went to sleep -- you're not necessarily in the same mood every night, nor even aware of when you went to sleep. But the next morning when you wake up, you're basically the same person who went to sleep the night before. As Swamiji explains, an architect going to sleep is not going to wake up as a surgeon the next morning just because the night before he was watching ER. He's going to wake up as an architect, because all his life he has accumulated the experiences of an architect. His mind has predominantly become an architectural mind.\n\nSo when I wake up the next morning, no matter what show I saw on TV last night, my mind will start where I left off. It may be that at the time of death I am not aware. But the subtle tendencies which my mind has gathered will take me to that world. We don't remember experiences -- even something about what I did in my childhood.\n\nI don't remember what happened in my youth -- a few things here and there we remember. But the tendencies we gathered made me who I am today. My across-the-street neighbor used to take me to Gita class. I really had no interest whatsoever, but because I couldn't say no, I went with her.\n\nThat Gita class led me to Gita class today. So the tendencies we gather -- we may not remember anything about them, but the experience of gathering those tendencies creates the sattvic mood or rajasic mood or tamasic mode, and we carry on. So it says one who dies with a sattvic predominance of mind will go to the world of the highest. The Puranas say it is Brahmaloka -- a place of abundant happiness, very little sorrow or no sorrow, and abundance of creativity. The world of creativity.\n\nSomebody who revels in creativity and gets joy out of that creativity. The next verse says Rajasi pralayam gatva Karma sangi su jayate. If all my life experience was rajasic -- in business and whatever else -- obviously when I die, my mind is still in that mode. I'm not carrying any memories of the experiences, but I'm carrying the tendency of those experiences with me. Maybe the last 15 days of my life I'm completely comatose.\n\nBut that just the connection with the body is disconnected. Mind in its own remain in its own health. And when it leaves, it carries those tendencies with it. So what I'm going to do is look for an environment where I can exhaust my vasanas -- my tendencies for being active. So I may be born in a businessman's house. Karma sanghi su Jayate.\n\nSuch a person gets an environment, a world of action, where he can exhaust his vasanas for actions. The Lord is very compassionate. The Lord of this universe, my own Lord, is very compassionate -- He only gives me what I want. If I want knowledge and creativity and awareness about myself, He will give me that. If I want actions, He will give me that too -- He will give me an opportunity to exhaust my vasanas. Tatha pralinas tamasi mudha yonishu jayate.\n\nBut if for some reason all my experience of life has been Tamas, then I'll go to the mudha yoni. And Swamiji basically explained that mudha yoni is one which is not aware of anything -- the animal kingdom and plant kingdom. Now obviously we are animals as well, but we are somewhat evolved in that we are aware of things. But if I am not really comfortable progressing in this world, sometimes I may be put in a position where I can be more comfortable in a simpler environment.\n\nWhat is the right thing to do then? Change that environment. Go back to where I feel comfortable, so I can start my progress appropriately from there. I don't know about here, but in India they sometimes will put you back in the fifth grade and say, well, let's put him back in the fourth grade because that will be the most comfortable. See, it's not a punishment. The Lord never punishes you for your own actions.\n\nYou only punish yourself for your own actions. Once the mudha yoni is what I'm most comfortable with, Bhagavan says, go back, start all over again from there and go further. And the next verse says Karmanaha sukritasya ahuhu satvikam nirmalam phalam. So what am I supposed to do? Am I just simply programmed, and by chance the experiences I'm having in this world will make me either Tamasic, Rajasic, or Sattvic? You do have a choice.\n\nVery little, but you have a choice. And the choice is Karmanaha sukritasya ahuhu satvikam nirmalam phalam -- the result of good action is pure and Sattvic. Rajasa tu phalam dukkham -- the result of Rajas is dukkham, sorrow. And I'll tell you, we have difficulty accepting that. If that's the case, we'll all stop acting.\n\nBut remember, we are not in a business class. We are not in any kind of social reform class. We are in a class to reform our own mind. In your own mind, you can try it yourself -- put in a spreadsheet what you have done and what the final outcome was of that action. In the end, there will be more pain than what you gained out of that action. Oh boy, that was a project from hell.\n\nBut we were dying to get that project. Because in the end this interaction with this world create frictions and the frictions create pain. The result is always more pain and little happiness. And therefore Vedanta also calls this world Dukkhalaya -- the house of pain. Now this is not to discourage people from doing what they are doing. This is for you to know, for your mind, what is good.\n\nFor my mind to remain in equanimity -- if I attach myself to this world, there is nothing but pain. If I attach to good actions, selfless actions, Karma Yoga, the results are sattvic and pure. Tamas Agnanam Tamasah phalam -- very obvious. If I am completely in Tamas, what is the result? So you decide what you should do.\n\nThe only thing you have in your hand is your own actions. Nahi kashchit kshanam api jatu tishthati akarma krit -- you cannot stand for any minute without acting. Good actions will lead to a Sattvic environment. So, of course, everyone wants to do that. Sattvat Sanjayate Jnanam -- so what happens when I do good actions?\n\nWell, people praise me and say Neel is a good person. No, he said, that's not your goal -- that's actually a detriment to you. The more people praise you, the more your ego gets hardened, and the more criticism you attract. Durijan Niire Rakhi Angan Kuti Chabai Binapani bin Sabana Nirmal kare Sadh. Sattvat Sanjayate Jnanam -- but why?\n\nI'm doing good actions because I want sattvic thoughts and a sattvic mood. And what's the result of that? I'll have knowledge -- knowledge about my own self, what my goal is, and how to get there. Sattvat Sanjayate Jnanam Rajaso Lobha Eva Cha -- he said, do you mean to say this man of action that everybody talks about is not good? This dynamic man of action, if he's driven by his own gains, the result will be greed.\n\nLobha -- greed. We had this hedge fund manager Rajaratnam, who was a billionaire. He must have come with $8 in his pocket from India. He was a multi-billionaire. But where is he today? Why do you need all those billions and then still have to do something which is illegal?",
      "reflection": "These verses reveal the profound consequences of which guna predominates at the moment of death—and, by extension, throughout life. Verse 13 lists Tamas symptoms: \"aprakāśa\" (absence of light), \"apravritti\" (inactivity), \"pramāda\" (heedlessness), and \"moha\" (delusion). But the teaching goes deeper: verses 14-15 explain that one who dies in a sattvic state reaches \"uttamavidām lokān amalān\"—the pure worlds of those who know the Highest. One who dies in Rajas is reborn \"karmasangishu\"—among those attached to action. One who dies in Tamas enters \"mūdhayonishu\"—the wombs of the deluded. This is not punishment but natural consequence—like an architect who, regardless of what TV show he watched last night, wakes up still an architect because that is what his mind has become through accumulated tendencies.\n\nThe teaching offers compassionate wisdom here: the Lord gives each soul exactly the environment it needs to exhaust its vasanas (tendencies). If you crave activity, you get an active life. If you crave knowledge, you get opportunities for wisdom. This is Lord's compassion, not punishment. Today, ask yourself honestly: What tendencies am I cultivating? If you were to die tonight, what would the predominant texture of your mind be—clarity, restlessness, or dullness? The beautiful news is that you have choice: \"karmanah sukritasya āhuh sāttvikam nirmalam phalam\"—the fruit of good action is pure and sattvic. Right now, in this moment, you can choose actions that cultivate Sattva. What one small choice can you make today that moves your baseline toward clarity and knowledge?"

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 14, Gunatraya Vibhaga Yoga, Yoga of the three gunas. So far, in the first six chapters we learned about the conditioned consciousness -- \"I\". In the next six chapters we learned about the Supreme Consciousness. From conditioned consciousness to the supreme Consciousness is the journey which we all are taking. So to help that journey, in the last chapter we have defined what is the field and who is the knower and what is the differentiation between the two. So we have said that the I, the knower, know the field which is this body, mind and intellect.\n\nI know my body, I know my mind, I know my intellect, therefore they are my field. And I, the knower, am the knower of the field. And the field cannot be the knower, and the knower cannot be the field. Now, in this chapter we are learning about the qualities of the field. So we are taking it a step at a time to understand how I can take this journey from this conditioned consciousness which I consider \"I\" -- or in Vedanta called Jiva, the limited self -- to the supreme self which is my true nature. And therefore the quest in life is always to achieve that balance where there is no sorrows, no limitations, nothing that will create unhappiness, a perfect happiness.\n\nAnd because there is no unhappiness, it cannot be called happiness, but just a bliss. So we have seen this and then we say these gunas. The Prakriti has three gunas. The field which is part of the Prakriti has three gunas. These gunas bind the knower to the field. Those are the attractions which create bondage between the Purusha and Prakriti, the knower and the field, and create identification.\n\nThis identification is because of these gunas. And those three gunas we have seen as Sattva rajas and Tamas. My awareness about this field is Sattva; the activity, the passion for something I like, is Rajas; and then ignorance is Tamas. These three bind me. So how do I get out of these three? Or is one of them helping me to get out of this conditioned consciousness to supreme consciousness?\n\nSo we have seen that Sattva gives knowledge, Rajas gives activity. And the byproduct would be greed -- one activity leads to another and to another and another, and there's no end to it. So that creates greed and Tamas creates inertia. So now we have to transcend from one to another. So one, the lowest we can see is inertia from our perspective.\n\nThese are the qualities of my mind right now. These are the qualities of the field. In this field the body is obviously completely inert. By its very nature it just cannot do anything but to exist. Just like we have seen, the atom has inertia and therefore it exists. As long as the inertia is there, atom exists as an atom.\n\nOnce you disturb the inertia, the Rajas will explode into atomic energy. Body is nothing but inertia. But the mind and intellect have all three. The Rajas, Tamas and Sattva. So these are the qualities of my mind which I'm most interested in. And that depending on the quality of my mind, if it is Sattva, it has a knowledge.\n\nPrakash, Gnaan -- if it is Rajas, I'm active with new projects, new activity. And inertia -- don't want to know anything, don't want to do anything. So the verses you have seen now tell me what happens if one guna or another is predominant in my mental zone. Urdhvam Gacchanti Sattvasthaha -- those who are established in Sattva. If my mental quality is predominantly Sattva, Urdhvam Gacchanti -- I go higher. \"Higher\" and \"lower\" are obviously concepts of my mind.\n\nI'm going towards my goal -- going from the conditioned consciousness to supreme consciousness, to unconditioned consciousness. This conditioning which is binding me, my goal is to get rid of it and become one with the unconditioned supreme consciousness. That which leads me to my goal, I consider higher. So Urdhvam Gacchanti Sattvasthaha -- the Sattvic mode of my mind will lead me towards my goal of unconditioning this conditioning. Then, Madhye Tishthanti Rajasaha -- those whose mental zone is predominantly Rajasic.\n\nThey remain in the middle. Neither are they going up nor are they going down. They remain in a status quo. Just like in our election -- we ended up where we started. The Rajasic do a lot of activities.\n\nBut in the end if you see the sum total, the result is the same. If you can look at all the activities we have done in life. All we have done is to create security for ourselves, stability for ourselves, some kind of a protection that we remain in a good condition. And in the end it all comes down to the same thing. Every few years we have to go through the same thing over and over and over again. So they basically remain in the same state they are in.\n\nNeither are they making progress upward nor going downwards. Neither are they unburdening themselves from their bondages nor creating more bondage -- they are in the same state. Jaghanya gunavrittisthaha adho gacchanti tamasaha. But those who are abiding in the lower qualities of Tamas, they go down. Obviously we are talking about human beings, about the human mind.\n\nThe human mind which has evolved for activity and knowledge to understand the world around it. The more it understands, the higher it goes. The more it gets entangled into this world, the more it remains where it is. The more it doesn't want to know, the more it goes down -- down in the sense of a situation where no more knowledge is necessary to survive, just the basic knowledge of \"I exist and I survive\" is good enough. They go down into that state of existence.\n\nIn the next verse we have seen: na anyam gunebhya kartaram yada drashta anupashyati. Why did we look at that verse? To introspect. In the spiritual quest, introspection is the most important aspect of our practice. You have to constantly introspect and see what is there in your mental zone. And if I find any impurities, I need to remove them -- that is antahkarana shuddhi.\n\nAnd then once I remove the impurity, the purity itself will reveal what is right and wrong. If I introspect and find myself to be in the tamasic zone, my next goal is to become Rajasic. Going from Tamasic to Sattvic is not an easy journey -- you have to go through Rajasic first. That's why the Bhagavad Gita says, the people who are doing good for the wrong reason -- let them do it, do not stop them. If I'm giving a donation to make my name, I'm at least better than the one who is not giving at all.\n\nThat's why the Bhagavad Gita says let them do it, for whatever the motivation. But you need to make progress. So he said, if I am in a tamasic zone, let me make sure that at least I'm active. If I'm in an active zone, I need to slow down and understand why I'm doing it. That introspection leads me to what will be the remedy, to what my next efforts should be.\n\nAnd therefore the next verse says this is not enough. Generally we understand, well, if I go from tamasic to rajasic to sattvic, I'm done -- because now I'm remaining in the sattvic guna. But we have also seen that even this sattvic guna is a bondage. We get used to doing good because people praise us: \"Well, you are really doing very well.\" So I want to keep getting that praise over and over again.\n\nIn other words, you get attached to happiness. The joy which comes out of knowledge, the joy which comes out of doing good, binds me to this. It does not let me leave. We have a saying in our architecture: what happens to the old architects? They don't die, they just wither away. They continue working till they drop dead in the studio.\n\nBecause that attachment to creativity -- that I'm doing something, I'm creating -- that attachment doesn't let you retire. So the bondage to Sattva is still a bondage. The real goal for the conditioned self is to go beyond the gunas. And how do you go beyond gunas? Na anyam gunebhya kartaram -- there is no other doer in my life other than my own gunas. Only the gunas are the doers for everything which I am doing, accomplishing, and losing.\n\nYada drashta anupashyati -- one who starts seeing this, that all my actions are driven by the modes of my mind. Only when my mind wants to see Skyfall does it act on that desire. Meena says, read this chapter, it's so nice. But in my mind, I'm going to see a Bond movie. Right now you can say whatever you want -- I'm not in the mood right now.\n\nSo who drives me to the Bond movie? Who brings me here to Gita class? My own gunas. If I can recognize my mind as the doer and say, all that I do is driven by the quality of my mind as thought -- whatever my thought, my action will be driven by that. So all my actions I should assign clearly to my mind. All the gunas are doing what they do. Na anyam -- there is no other. You can say, well, I was forced by society.\n\nWell, I really didn't want to go see a movie, but they insisted. We used to do that when I was in college. I really didn't want to go just before the exam, but all my room partners said, Neel, come on. I blame my room partners for why I went to see a movie just before the day of the examination. But if I had no tendencies, I wouldn't have gone.\n\nSo Bhagavan says Na anyam gunebhya kartaram -- there is none other than my gunas as the doers for all my actions. One who sees that -- Yada drashta anupashyati -- one who starts seeing that all my actions are driven by my mind and the qualities of my mind. Gunebhyash cha param vetti -- and he says there is someone higher than these gunas, someone much higher than my mind, who also sees the limitations of my mind. \"Well, I shouldn't have gone to see a movie just before the exam.\"\n\nThe \"I\" who says \"I shouldn't have\" is different from the \"I\" who went to see a movie. Gunebhyah param vetti -- one who knows that there is one who is above these gunas. Mad Bhavam sa adhigacchati -- identify with that. I really don't need to take any credit or blame for my actions. My mind was in that mood and I did that. However, I am not my mind. My mind is just a field in which my consciousness functions.\n\nThat consciousness never took part in any of the action. If my identification takes place that way, Bhagavan says, Mad Bhavam sa adhigacchati -- he attains my being. We have seen the supreme consciousness. Unconditioned by the limitations of body, mind and intellect, he becomes one with me. As Swamiji says, he doesn't become Krishna with flute and peacock feather.\n\nHe becomes one with that unconditioned consciousness. He now starts identifying with the room space analogy. Once the space leaves its identification with the walls, floor and ceiling -- remaining within the room -- it identifies now with the space outside. I'm none other than this universal space. Gunaan etan atitya trin dehi deha samudbhavan -- this dehi, one who considers \"this is me, this body, this mind is me,\" is created by these gunas.\n\nThese gunas bound me to this body and said, \"this is me.\"",
      "reflection": "These verses map the spiritual trajectory of each guna with striking clarity. Verse 18 declares: \"ūrdhvam gacchanti sattvasthāh\"—those established in Sattva rise upward toward liberation. \"Madhye tishthanti rājasāh\"—the rajasic remain in the middle, neither ascending nor descending, like a person running endlessly on a treadmill. \"Adho gacchanti tāmasāh\"—the tamasic descend into lower states of existence. Yet the teaching reveals a crucial truth often missed: even Sattva is bondage. The joy of knowledge, the pleasure of doing good, the praise of others—all these can become golden chains. As the teaching notes, \"what happens to old architects? They don't die, they just wither away\"—attached to creativity until the end.\n\nThe prescription becomes clear: use introspection to diagnose your current state, then systematically work upward. If you find yourself in Tamas—unwilling to know or act—the remedy is not to leap directly to Sattva but to first become Rajasic, to become active. If you find yourself in Rajas—compulsively doing but not understanding why—slow down and seek clarity. But even when you reach Sattva, don't stop there. Verse 19 points beyond: \"nānyam gunebhyah kartāram yadā drashtā anupashyati\"—when the seer recognizes that ONLY the gunas act, and perceives That which is beyond the gunas, he attains the Divine nature. Today, practice this: observe your actions and say, \"My gunas are doing this, not I.\" The one who can make this distinction has begun the journey beyond all three. What guna is predominant in you right now? What is the appropriate next step upward?"

Gunebhyash cha param vetti -- and he says there is someone higher than these gunas, someone much higher than my mind, who also sees the limitations of my mind. \"Well, I shouldn't have gone to see a movie just before the exam.\"\n\nThe \"I\" who says \"I shouldn't have\" is different from the \"I\" who went to see a movie. Gunebhyah param vetti -- one who knows that there is one who is above these gunas. Mad Bhavam sa adhigacchati -- identify with that. I really don't need to take any credit or blame for my actions. My mind was in that mood and I did that. However, I am not my mind. My mind is just a field in which my consciousness functions.\n\nThat consciousness never took part in any of the action. If my identification takes place that way, Bhagavan says, Mad Bhavam sa adhigacchati -- he attains my being. We have seen the supreme consciousness. Unconditioned by the limitations of body, mind and intellect, he becomes one with me. As Swamiji says, he doesn't become Krishna with flute and peacock feather.\n\nHe becomes one with that unconditioned consciousness. He now starts identifying with the room space analogy. Once the space leaves its identification with the walls, floor and ceiling -- remaining within the room -- it identifies now with the space outside. I'm none other than this universal space. Gunaan etan atitya trin dehi deha samudbhavan -- this dehi, one who considers \"this is me, this body, this mind is me,\" is created by these gunas.\n\nThese gunas bound me to this body and said, \"this is me.\"",
      "reflection": "Verse 19 contains the pivotal teaching of this chapter: \"nānyam gunebhyah kartāram\"—there is NO doer other than the gunas. When you truly see this, everything shifts. That moment when you said something hurtful? Your gunas were acting. That burst of creative brilliance? Your gunas again. The one who SEES this—the \"drashta\" (witness)—stands apart from all action. And Krishna promises: \"gunebhyash cha param vetti madbhāvam so adhigacchati\"—one who knows the Self as beyond the gunas attains My nature. This is not becoming Krishna with flute and peacock feather, as Swamiji clarifies, but becoming one with unconditioned consciousness itself.\n\nVerse 20 reveals what transcendence brings: freedom from \"janma-mrityu-jarā-duhkhaih\"—birth, death, old age, and sorrow. The embodied self, once it transcends the three gunas that caused physical existence, \"amritam ashnute\"—tastes immortality. Arjuna then asks the practical questions we all ask (verse 21): How do I recognize such a person? How does he behave? How did he get there? Today, practice the essential shift: When you catch yourself saying \"I did this\" or \"I felt that,\" pause and reframe—\"The gunas did this; the gunas felt that.\" Notice how this creates space between you and your experience. The teaching uses a powerful example: \"The one who says 'I shouldn't have gone to the movie before the exam' is different from the one who went.\" Who is that witness in you? Can you find and rest in that awareness today, even for a moment?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 14, Gunatraya Vibhaga Yoga, Yoga of the three gunas. So far in Bhagavad Gita, you have learned about ourselves in the first six chapters -- who we are as limited beings, how we function, how we can make the most out of our actions, and how we can be most efficient. And we learned that working without any attachment or expectation is actually the best method to gain the most out of your life and most out of your actions. To become the most proficient and efficient, the basic requirement is not to get too attached to whatever you are doing. This is completely contrary to what we think.\n\nWe think the more passionate I am, the better I will be. Bhagavad Gita says it's the other way around. The less you are attached to what you are doing, the more efficient you would be, the more successful you would be. So this is what we learned in the first six chapters. That's called Karma Yoga. How to act in this world as a limited being and to get the most out of your life is Karma Yoga.\n\nThen we focused on who you are in reality -- that you are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not this intellect. So Dhyana Yoga, contemplating upon that supreme self -- the self that I am beyond this limited self -- we have learned this in the next set of chapters, culminating in Bhakti Yoga, the devotion to that self. Unless I identify with something higher, I cannot detach from the lower. To resign from my job, I have to find another job before I resign. If I'm a smart person, I don't resign before getting the next job.\n\nYou have to find a better job before you can resign from your current one, which you either hate or at least don't love as much. This limited self, even though I'm comfortable -- it's not the best situation I'm in. I'm not always happy, I'm not always achieving what I'm trying to achieve. So I'm trying to see something better than what I have today, something which can give me permanent happiness. Bhagavan said, identify with that self which is capable of giving you permanent happiness. That's Bhakti Yoga.\n\nBhakti Yoga is truly to identify with that which has no limitations. As long as I'm identified with this limited being, there is no chance, ever in eons to come, that I'll achieve my goal of being perfectly happy. But once you identify with that supreme self -- then the question becomes, what is the difference between the limited self and the higher self, and how to go beyond those limitations? So the last chapter we talked about Kshetra-Kshetrajna Vibhaga Yoga.\n\nWhat is the field and who is the knower? The knower is always someone other than the field. If I know something, that means it's an object. If I know my limited self, the limited self is an object, and I, the knower, am knowing the limited self. So there we identified that this body -- Idam Sareeram Kaunteya Etat Kshetram Iti Abhidhiyate -- this body is the field.\n\nThis body includes all my experiences, my mind, my thoughts, modifications of my moods -- all that is the field. But one who is witnessing it is the witness. So now, how do I go beyond this? We have been learning in this chapter what is binding this unlimited self to the limited self. And we came to the conclusion that it is the three gunas of the Prakriti. This Prakriti, the manifest world, has three basic qualities.\n\nThe three ingredients which make it a pluralistic world, now projecting as a plural world. We know from science that there was nothing but singularity before the Big Bang, and then this world of cosmos came into existence. I was just reading Stephen Hawking -- some dialogue with somebody. And somebody asked him, so what was before the Big Bang?\n\nAnd he said, nothing. Nothing before the Big Bang. But there was something -- because, as we say, something cannot come out of nothing. So there was something, but that something was not as divided as we perceive it right now. We also learned about cause and effect.\n\nThat effect can be nothing but the cause modified. This cosmos cannot be anything but the singularity modified. So Bhagavan said that you have to understand what is binding you to this worldview of pluralistic world. And you are at the center of your own world. I'm in the center of my world. Everything relates to me.\n\nIf I remove myself from this world, the world disappears. When I'm not there, that world does not exist. What's happening in Syria right now does not exist for me, because I'm not there. But what's happening here -- I'm very much involved, it all relates to me. Once I remove this limited self out of this equation, the pluralistic world does not exist.\n\nThese three gunas are binding this infinite to this limited self. Gunas as we have learned, also means ropes. These three ropes are binding you to this limitedness. We are not giving up our limitedness, but expecting infinite happiness, unlimited existence. We all think that we are going to exist forever. We have learned in Mahabharata that Yaksha asked you this direct question.\n\nWhat is the most wonderful you find about human beings? The most wonderful, most amazing thing is that everyone knows he's going to die. But they all live like they're never going to die. We cannot think about ourselves as non existing. Existence is my real nature. But I also know that this life as I know will end sooner or later.\n\nHow can I get out of this fear of mortality, this fear of unhappiness? Bhagavan said, you need to get rid of these three binding ropes. You have this great wealth of Sat, Chit, and Ananda, but you just don't have the password to that account. Somebody says, Neel, your great grandfather left great wealth in a Swiss account -- the only problem is we don't have the account number. So we know that we are Satchitananda.\n\nWe just don't know the key to it. So Bhagavan said, know that these three are binding you. Once you get out of these three, you will achieve that state where you are immortal, always blissful, and all-knowing. So we have learned that these three gunas are binding -- they are Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas. Sattva binds you with happiness, Rajas by activity, and Tamas by laziness or inactivity.\n\nSo the ultimate prescription was Guna tita Bhava -- go beyond these three gunas. Arjuna obviously says, okay, all this is well and good, but how can one get to that point? The last verse we have seen says Kair lingais trin gunan etan atito Bhavati prabhu -- how can anyone go beyond these three gunas? Once he achieves that, what will be his behavior? Katham cha etan trin gunan ativartate.\n\nHow can I understand that this is possible? Give me some indications -- like a litmus test -- that if I see this, it means that person has gone beyond the three gunas. And also, if that is possible, if somebody has already done that, then tell me the recipe for how to get there. Now we know that Bhagavan has been talking about it throughout the Bhagavad Gita. But Arjuna one more time asks this question to make it very clear that this is the goal of life.\n\nSo Bhagavan answers in the following verses, and it's really very unique. Verse 22 -- this is something we really want to contemplate. What is his answer? Prakasham cha Pravritim cha Moham eva cha Pandava Na dveshti sampravrittani -- he did not say that these gunas will disappear once you become Nirguna, Gunatita. He does not hate when these three gunas are present. Prakasham cha Pravritim cha Moham -- these are the effects of these three gunas.\n\nPrakash -- light, knowledge, clear-headedness. We clearly understand what's going on. Things are very clear, no confusion. That's the effect of Sattva. When my mind and intellect are in Sattva Guna, everything is crystal clear. I don't need somebody's advice.\n\nI know what is right and what is wrong. Pravritti -- activity, I'm busy. That's the effect of Rajas. And Moha -- delusion. I don't understand what's going on, I don't know whether they're right or wrong. Moha is the effect of Tamas.\n\nWhen these are present in my personality, in my mind, I don't hate them. Up till now we were thinking that when somebody says Guna Tita Bhava, it means I will not have those gunas at all. Bhagavan makes it very clear: these gunas will remain as they are. Just because you became Sthita Prajna, the world is not going to change. Neither the quality nor the nature of your body, mind, and intellect are going to change.\n\nIf I am a weakling, it's not overnight going to change just because I have become a Gnani. The body will have its own Dharma -- it will be exactly what it was before realization and after realization. The mind will have its own Dharma. It has been with you for eons; it has its own personality.\n\nIt's not going to change. Neither is the intellect overnight going to become Einstein. We know these are my equipment and I have to live with their limitations. But I, at the core of my being, seeing that happening in my mind and intellect, remain a witness. And I don't hate that. \"Why am I in this mood?\" is not a question. This is how I react when things happen this way.\n\nThis is my nature. Na nivrittani kankshati -- he also does not desire them when they are not present. When I am in a sattvic mood, things are very clear, and I'm very happy about my own clarity. Then when I lose that sattvic mood and get into Rajasic or Tamasic territory, I hate that -- I want to be back to my serene, clean, clear state of mind. Bhagavan says that's not how it works, and therefore you shouldn't be desirous of clinging to those states. Many people say, I was meditating, the very first day it was very good, but from the second day onward nothing really happened.\n\nThe more you desire and grasp, the more it will stay away from you. In Gujarat there is a saying: one who is asking for it, things go away from them; and one who says \"I don't need it,\" people will come to you. The more you say \"I don't need it,\" the more people offer; the more you say \"I want it,\" the more people take away from you. So Bhagavan says, when the effects of these three gunas are present, don't hate them. Understand that these are the common experiences for everyone. Na nivrittani -- when something is absent, when I was enjoying my activity, I was very busy, and now I'm not -- accept it as is.\n\nSo the acceptance is the mark of a true Gnani. One who accepts his reality as it is -- that is Bhagavan's answer to Arjuna's question: what are his qualities? His qualities are that he accepts things as they are. He does not hate them if they are happening; he does not desire them if they are not happening. Now this is very difficult for us to accept, because as soon as we talk about somebody, we say, I don't know, he has been talking about all this, but then the other day this thing happened and he reacted this way. He reacted this way because this is how he was made up through all his life.\n\nBut you do not know how that incident affected him. Once, at the core of your being, you become a witness.",
      "reflection": "Krishna's answer to Arjuna's question is revolutionary and often misunderstood. Verse 22 does NOT say the gunas disappear for the enlightened one. Rather: \"prakāsham cha pravrittim cha moham eva cha... na dveshti sampravrittāni na nivrittāni kānkshati\"—when light (Sattva), activity (Rajas), or delusion (Tamas) are present, he does not hate them; when they are absent, he does not crave them. This is radical acceptance. The liberated one still experiences all three gunas—clarity fades into restlessness, restlessness into dullness—but he neither clings to the pleasant states nor pushes away the unpleasant ones. He remains \"udāsīnavat āsīnah\"—seated like one indifferent, unmoved by the gunas' play.\n\nVerse 24 paints the portrait of such equanimity: \"sama-duhkha-sukhah svastah\"—equal in pain and pleasure, established in the Self. \"Sama-loshta-ashma-kānchanah\"—to whom a clod of earth, a stone, and gold are the same. \"Tulya-priya-apriyah\"—equal toward the pleasant and unpleasant. \"Tulya-nindā-ātma-samstutih\"—the same whether criticized or praised. This is not suppression or indifference but a fundamental shift in identity. Today, test yourself: When you are in a sattvic, clear state, do you grasp at it, fearing its loss? When you feel dull or agitated, do you fight against it? Practice letting each state arise and pass without the second layer of reaction—without craving the good or hating the bad. Notice: the one who can observe both pleasant and unpleasant states with equanimity is already beyond both. That witness is your true nature."

      ],
      "commentary": "Okay, so I will be discussing the last four verses of chapter 14. Chapter 14 is the Gunatraya Vibhaga Yoga. We have discussed and basically found so far that in this Prakriti, this manifest world, everything has these three gunas, which are the signature of Prakriti: Sattva -- the light, the knowledge, the awareness; Rajas -- the activity; and Tamas -- inertia. These three gunas bind this supreme self, which has no limitations, to this limited being. These qualities belong to my body, mind and intellect. Once the consciousness attaches to this, it takes upon itself all the limitations of Prakriti.\n\nSo I, the ego, am right now conditioned by this body, mind, and intellect. Therefore I have all the limitations of body, mind, and intellect. Therefore I go through sorrows and happiness, pleasant and unpleasant experiences, conducive and unconducive situations. Because each entity by itself has its own priorities and its own situations. The world remains the world -- one person sees it as very positive, the other sees it as very negative.\n\nDepending on their own conditioning, one who goes beyond these three gunas will be beyond all these conflicts and sorrows. So what we have seen is that these three gunas also belong to my mind. It is my mind which is sometimes sattvic, sometimes rajasic, or sometimes tamasic. Depending on the qualities of my mind, I'll see this world as Sattvic, Rajasic, or Tamasic. My experiences will be driven by the moods of my mind.\n\nSo if I can get over this, if I can introspect and vigilantly monitor the moods of my mind, I will be able to rise above the situations I am facing. The situation remains the same, but I can change the mood of my mind, and that will change my reaction to the situation. But the ultimate goal is to go beyond the three gunas all the time. So the verse we have seen: udasina avad asino gunaihi yo na vichalyate -- one who is indifferent to these gunas and does not get swallowed by them. Guna vartanta iti eva avatishtati na ingate.\n\nWhat is happening in this world is nothing but the play of the gunas. Gunas are the ones acting in this world. Guna guneshu vartante iti matvaa na sajjate -- knowing that what is happening is the gunas of my senses and the gunas of this world of objects reacting with each other. When I have an experience, it is an interaction between the gunas of my senses, my body, my mind, and the gunas of the objects. So when I come across a conducive situation, I feel happy.\n\nIn an unconducive situation, I'm not happy -- but the one who knows that the self that I am does not get disturbed by it remains steady. This verse 23: Guna vartanta iti eva avatishtati na ingate -- knowing that these are all the play of the gunas only, and nothing to do with me the self, he does not move from his state of bliss. He is always in the state of bliss as the self. When we hear what's happening in Tahrir Square in Egypt, does it really make me so upset that I couldn't sleep at night?\n\nI may have my opinion whether they're good or bad for the world, but that's all it is -- I'm a third-party observer. If I can do the same thing for everything happening to me in my own \"Tahrir Square,\" then I will be the same way. That's all it's saying.\n\nSo now, Arjuna had asked three questions. One: what are the marks of a person who has gone beyond the gunas?\n\nThis is exactly similar to chapter two, where he asks, what are the qualities of a person who is Buddhi-sthita, established in wisdom? Same thing here: how do I know that person has gone beyond the gunas? Then, how does he move around and talk in this world? And lastly, how did he do it? The one who is beyond the gunas, knowing that this is the play of gunas only, does not get disturbed.\n\nThat's the mark of him. What will be his behavior? We have seen in the following verses: Sama dukha sukhaha svasthaha sama loshta ashma kanchanaha tulya priya apriya dhiraha tulya ninda atma samstutih. We have seen this in Bhagavad Gita before -- the quality of a person whose Buddhi is established in the supreme self and not in this limited self. When things occur in this life, such a person sees that it's this ego reacting with the world outside, and therefore Sama dukha sukhaha -- whether the condition is conducive or non-conducive, he remains the same.\n\nHe sees that we don't have big riots when seasons change. From spring we move to fall and then winter. We don't have riots in the streets about that. Why? Because we accept that's how nature is. After spring, fall has to come, and after fall, winter has to come.\n\nWe adjust to it. In our life, we are not accepting this -- we always want a hundred percent happiness all the time, and therefore we get all disturbed. But the person who knows this, just like I know that fall will come after spring and winter will come after fall, knows that after every happy occasion there is something unhappy, non-conducive. Those of you educated by Indian TV know this all the time, right? So Sama dukha sukhaha svasthaha.\n\nHe remains Svasthaha -- balanced, not affected by Sukha or Dukha. Knowing this is a temporary interaction between the gunas of myself as body, mind, intellect, and the world. When the economy is doing well, we are all very happy -- everybody talks about the party, about how much money they made in the stock market. Now we all talk about, I don't know what Obama is doing.\n\nWhy doesn't he think about me? That's the nature of this world. Sama loshta ashma kanchanaha -- he also sees no greater value in one thing of this world than another. Now does that mean that if somebody asks for one rupee, he gives away a thousand-dollar note? No. A transaction in this world is a transaction between me, the limited being, and the world. That is what is called Vyavahara.\n\nAnd Vyavahara should be appropriate to the situation. However, such a person doesn't see one transaction as inherently more important than another. Swamiji gives an example: when you were a little kid, a game card -- one was more valuable than the other. I grew up in India, so we used to have Parle bottle tops. There was a value to each one -- a Parle cap had greater value than a certain other brand, right?\n\nAnybody remember that? In those days, your wealth was those bottle tops, and if somebody took them away from you, it was devastating. But when you grow out of it, all those bottle tops are worth nothing to you. One who sees the world that way knows that each thing has its own value in that particular transaction at a particular time. Therefore we say, you may have a styrofoam cup and somebody has a gold cup. Both are thirsty and going to a lake -- which one is more valuable than the other?\n\nAs long as there is an emptiness which can fetch water -- for me, that's all that counts. At that moment, the value of gold and the value of styrofoam is exactly the same, depending on which can fetch more water. So sama loshta ashma kanchanaha -- he does not give greater value to one or the other, knowing that the value only belongs to the exchange or the utility in that particular transaction. Tulya priya apriya -- this one, obviously, we all can use.\n\nHe remains the same when something comes which is dear to me or not dear to me, because it is not in my control. We struggle through in this economy, go through interviews and proposals, and we come out and everybody says, Neel, you really did a fantastic presentation. I feel so good -- until I hear that my competition got the project. Things will come to you by their own nature. They are not depending on my efforts alone; they're coming to me by their own nature.\n\nAnd I react to that as my right or my misfortune, depending on what is coming to me. You can really see it: I say, boy, Neel, you did so good -- but when you don't, I think you should have prepared a little better. Neel, I think this time you were not really ready; you should have prepared more. Whether it's good or bad.\n\nWhat happened? Suddenly my success now defines whether I was good or not. We were reading about Steve Jobs. He threw away all the rules of business -- no focus groups, no surveys, nothing. \"What do people know about what they want? I will tell them what they want.\" So he worked completely contrary to other people's business models, as taught in Harvard and everywhere else.\n\nAnd his is the most successful company. So now we say, let's look at the Steve Jobs model, how he built the company. You have to remain the same whether people are praising you or not. They praise you simply because it is the nature of the world, not yours. And then the next verse says Mana apamana yoho tulyaha tulyo mitraha aripaksha yoho. Continuing the same teaching.\n\nBhagavan says such a person who has gone beyond the gunas is acting in this manner. He is working in this world as a normal person, but in his mind, he sees all this as a temporary occurrence -- nothing that he controls. His duty is to act according to dharma in each situation. Mana apamana yoho -- this is obviously very important to us because we get hurt very easily. Mana and apmana -- honor and dishonor -- are at our mental level.\n\nThis is truly at our mind's level. Sometimes the person who is telling you something had no intention of insulting you or hurting you. But you take it that way because your mental state was such that you received it that way. If I'm supremely confident, people say something critical and I think, don't worry about it. But if I'm already shaky, then somebody says, Neel, you're not doing well.\n\nThen I collapse right there. So it is not the world, but my mind that decides whether this is mana or apmana. He is so established in himself that whatever comes from the world, he just takes it at face value and moves on. Mitraha aripakshayoho -- this is another important quality. These are my friends and these are my enemies.\n\nMy relationship may be different with each person, but my inner stance toward them should remain the same. That does not mean that when enemies are attacking your country, you say, well, we'll receive you the same way we receive our allies. At that time, your Vyavahara -- your appropriate action -- is to protect your country. But just as Gandhi said, I hate the British government but not the British people. It's not the person you are reacting to, but the action you are reacting to. Therefore, tulya mitra aripaksha -- equal toward friend and foe.\n\nAripaksha -- the foes, the enemies. Mitra -- friend. We all know this. Sarva Arambha parityagi -- we have seen it before, and this is the most difficult one. He gives up all endeavors, all efforts. Sarva Arambha parityagi -- this sounds like complete death.\n\nIf I stop doing everything, it's a complete death. I will stop all my endeavors and efforts when I die. Swamiji explained that's exactly what they're asking you to do.",
      "reflection": "These concluding verses answer Arjuna's final question: How does one transcend the gunas? Verse 25 continues the portrait: \"mānāpamānayoh tulyah\"—equal in honor and dishonor, \"tulyo mitrāri-pakshayoh\"—the same toward friend and foe. Then comes the challenging phrase: \"sarvārambha-parityāgī\"—one who has abandoned all undertakings. This sounds like death itself! But the teaching clarifies: it means giving up the SENSE of personal doership, not the actions themselves. Continue to work, but know that the gunas alone act while you remain the witness. Verse 26 then gives the method: \"mām cha yo avyabhichārena bhaktiyogena sevate\"—one who serves Me with unwavering devotion transcends the gunas and becomes fit for union with Brahman.\n\nThe chapter's final verse (27) reveals Krishna's ultimate identity: \"brahmanah hi pratishthā aham\"—I am the abode of Brahman, \"amritasya avyayasya cha\"—of immortality and imperishability, \"shāshvatasya cha dharmasya\"—of eternal dharma, \"sukhasyaikāntikasya cha\"—and of absolute bliss. This is where the journey ends—or rather, where the illusion of journey dissolves. Today, practice \"sarva-ārambha-parityāga\" in a practical way: choose one activity and perform it completely, but without the sense that \"I am doing this.\" Let the hands move, let the mind think, but rest as the awareness in which all this happens. Notice how this does not diminish the quality of action—often it improves it, as you noted from the Karma Yoga teachings. The one who has nothing to prove, nothing to gain, acts with perfect freedom. Can you taste that freedom today, even in one small task?"

      "commentary": "We have completed chapter 14, Gunatraya Vibhaga Yoga. And now we will be starting discussion of Chapter 15, Purushottam Yoga -- Yoga of the Supreme Purusha. In Chapter 13 we have seen the difference between the field and its knower. The Prakriti is the field, and the one which is aware of the field is the knower of the field. So at my individual level, we have learned that this body is the field.\n\nThe one who is aware of the body is the knower of the field. So the body is part of the Prakriti. But I, the knower is part of the Purusha, the manifestation of Purusha in me. This Purusha which is imperishable, right now I consider it to be perishable because it is identified with this perishable body. To make this connection between the Purusha and Prakriti at both my individual level and at the universal level, we learned in chapter 14 that the Purusha is the father of all the beings and Prakriti is the womb of all the beings in this world. So Prakriti is the mother and Purusha is the father.\n\nAny being which is born at any place, to any womb -- Bhagavan said, consider this great Prakriti as the womb and I am the seed-giving Father. We see the variety of beings and things in this world; that variety is explained by these three Gunas, the three binding ropes which bind this imperishable Purusha to this perishable manifestation. This variety of things and beings are created by the permutation and combination of these Gunas, the three modes of material nature. This variety of things and beings around me create my Sansaar. My relationship with these things and beings is my Sansaar.\n\nThis Sansaar is ever changing Samsaratiyeti Sansaar. That which is constantly changing is Sansaar. Sansaar does not remain same. That which was there a minute ago has already changed. It has already passed. So we constantly are struggling with this ever changing Sansaar.\n\nThis Sansaar continues to grow. When I was just a single person and a student, my Sansaar was limited to me and my parents. Then you get married -- so now you have become two. Your problem plus her problem, and then we have children. So not only my problem, her problem, but also his problem. A few years ago when I used to go to India, I used to have only three houses to visit -- my three brothers.\n\nNow when I go there, it is not only my brother's houses but their children -- they are married, their in-laws. So by the time I'm done, the 15 days are just gone, just meeting with all their relatives. Because my Sansaar has grown. Bhajagovindam says: \"Bala tat krida sakthah, taruna tat taruni sakthah, vruddha tavat chinta sakthah.\" When I was a child, I was engaged in plays and toys. When I was a young man, I was engaged in chasing girls. When I became an old man, I'm just overwhelmed by worries.\n\nI said well why would that be? You should be relieved. So I was actually looking forward to an old age. Because I thought the old age means my children will be married. I will have no worries then I will be completely free. Now that I have become an old man, I realize how true that verse was.\n\nNot only did I have to worry about myself, my family, my children, but also their children. So my Sansaar has grown so large. To detach from the Sansaar is increasingly becoming more and more difficult as the Sansaar grows. So this chapter opens up with the allegory of this Sansaar. It says: Urdhvamulah adhah shakham ashvattham prahuhu avyayam, Chandamsi Yasya Parnani, Yastam Veda sa Veda vit -- describing this Sansaar by using this allegory where it is like an upside-down tree. Now this allegory has been used in the Upanishads. In the Katha Upanishad, in the sixth portion, the Lord of death Yama indicates to Nachiketa that this Sansaar is like the upside-down tree.\n\nThe roots are in heaven and it is spreading in this world below. So my Sansaar right now is like that Urdhvamuna. Its source is up above. We always say anything which is higher say up Bhagavan kaha Upar. So this world as we see Bhagavad Gita and the Upanishad say the source is Apa. Source is somewhere beyond my perception.\n\nUrdhvamuna adas Sakaha all the branches are below. That which I see growing is here in my world. I see its effect, I don't see the cause. So in our normal tree, roots are not perceivable. They are not perceived. They are below under the ground.\n\nBut we see the trunk and we see the branches. And these branches continue to grow. And this Sansaar is like that. As we have learned a few lectures ago, the return in farming is thousand fold. So traditionally the farmers were the richest people. Even the kings were farmers.\n\nJanakaraja found Sita while tilling the land, because farming was the most profitable business, most rewarding business. You sow one seed and a thousand come out. So the growth is exponential in anything in nature. The tree grows exponentially. My Sansaar is like that -- it grows exponentially beyond my control.\n\nI do one action and it creates a thousand reactions. The allegory of the tree shows this: one action generates a thousand connections in my Sansaar. And its source is Apaba Urdhvamulaha Adasakaha. I see the branches of my Sansaar here below. Prahuhu Abyam the wise people talk about this tree of Sansaar is something which has the roots above the branches below Chandansi, Yasya, Panani.\n\nThe Vedas are its leaves. This verse about the Vedas being the leaves needs explanation because the connection is not immediately obvious. We have seen the commentaries by various scholars. Swamiji explains here that Bhagavan Sankaracharya says the tree is explained as Ashvattha. Because when you break down the word Ashvattha, it becomes \"that which does not remain the same tomorrow.\"\n\nTherefore this tree of Sansaar is explained as Asvathaha. And therefore that which promotes growth to this tree is the Vedas. The knowledge of Vedas, the instructions in Vedas, when followed by a person, his Sansaar grows healthily. By knowing this Sansaar and Prakriti, I more and more grow my Sansaar here. So these Vedas, the knowledge grows this tree of Sansaar in my life, in yours, in his Chandansi, Yasya, Pranani, Yastam, Vedasa, Veda Vid. And he who knows, he is a Veda knower.\n\nOne who knows both the roots and the branches of this tree, he knows the entire tree. So when I look at the tree I already know because I am a Veda knower of the trees that the roots are below in the ground. So There is a knowledge about where the roots are for the tree that makes my knowledge of the tree complete. So right now my knowledge of my Sansaar is incomplete. Because I only know what I see. So I only believe that what I see is the reality beyond my perception.\n\nI don't see there is reality. The other day we are explaining myth to Meda and say myth is something, a made up story to explain something. And she said okay then my English homework is a myth because it's made of stories in it. So we consider that seeing is believing. Everything I see as real is real. Everything else is myth.\n\nAnd therefore our knowledge is incomplete about this tree of Sansaar. I will know this tree of Sansaar completely when I know the roots, what the source of this tree of Sansaar is. That's why we are lacking for one side. So therefore I say one who knows this, he knows the Vedas. Vedas explain both the cause and effect. The roots and its tree.\n\nSo one who knows both is the Veda knower. Not the one who is only rooted in the Prakriti or this world. Only Yastam Vedasa Vedavid. Such a person knows the Vedas. Adhacha Urdhvam Prasuta Tashishaka, Guna Pravruddha, Vishe Pravalaha. So our Sansaar is now described using this allegory of a tree.\n\nSo that we understand how my world works. We talked about Prakriti in detail in last chapter but we have still stopped at. But these are the Gunas which are binding me and I need to go beyond these Gunas. Now we are learning about this Sansaar which is constantly changing. And how can I liberate myself from this Sansaar root? The cause for this is the Purusha.\n\nUnless there is consciousness, there is no Sansaar. How this Sansaar is rooted in this consciousness is what I'm trying to understand. That this tree grows in my world. Adha Cha Urdham, Prasuta Tashya Shah. Its branches are up and also below my world of ideas. Prakriti in the lower world where I live in.\n\nBut I also have ideas about the higher nature. So my ideas go both ways. They go up and they go down. I think about mundane thing but I also think about the sacred things. So my branches of my Sansaar is spreading in both directions in my Prakriti in my day to day life. But also what is beyond my day to day life.\n\nGuna Pravrudha, Vishaya pravalaha. These branches are nourished by the Gunas. They get more and more entangled into this prakruti. Bound by these Gunas I get more and more entangled in my world here because of the Gunas, my vasanas, my tendencies bind me to this world. My tendency is the music. So I somehow will always have to have some kind of a musical event because my Gunas is binding me.\n\nSo these Gunas are binding me into this world below. Guna pravruddha, vishaya pravalaha and the sense objects are the buds. So the sense objects have the potential to grow my Sansaar. If I see something which is of my liking, then my Sansaar will grow in that direction. As we have seen, given opportunity, I have these latent tendencies. And when the right environment is given to me, those tendencies will play out -- first as desires and then as actions.\n\nSo if I don't have a chance, if there is no field then those tendencies will remain dormant. So I may be the nicest person if there is no opportunity given to me to get bribed. I have never taken a bribe in my life, but I may have a tendency to take a bribe which was never given an opportunity. The sense objects are buds. This opportunity presenting itself will then grow that tendency in me as desire and into actions. So the sense objects are the buds which have the capability to grow my Sansaar in the direction of my tendencies, depending on whether I'm sattvic, rajasic, or tamasic.\n\nThe sense objects will grow my Sansaar in that direction. Adaachar mulani anusanthatani and while I am functioning in this world bound by these Gunas, I am also developing my roots in this prakrit in this world. When we first moved to Richmond, because we moved from Northern Virginia, we were pretty active there. You know, we were running all these classes and all my friends, they say, Neil, it's not too far, only two hours. So anytime we have an event, you come down to Northern Virginia. So first about few months we did that, you know, they will have a music party and they will call me and we go down there, we will have music party, we call them and they come down here.\n\nGradually we started having roots here in Richmond. You know, we have friends here, our own group, and we have classes. So now that we have grown our roots here in Richmond, we gradually get detached from those Northern Virginia friends. Now they call me and I say, yeah, but I don't have time -- I have activities here, I have classes here, so I can't come.",
      "reflection": "The Ashvattha tree described in these verses presents a powerful mirror for self-examination. Notice how the word \"Ashvattha\" itself means \"that which does not remain the same tomorrow\" - reminding us that our entire world of relationships, possessions, and circumstances is in constant flux. Yet we keep planting our roots deeper into this ever-changing soil, establishing ourselves in jobs, cities, and social circles as if they were permanent. Consider today: where have you been growing roots that bind you more tightly to the impermanent? The verse tells us that the Vedas - knowledge itself - are the leaves that nourish this tree. Even our learning can become an attachment that expands rather than liberates us.\n\nThe remedy offered is remarkably specific: \"asanga-shastrena dridhena\" - with the strong weapon of non-attachment, cut this tree. This is not about abandoning responsibilities, but about loosening the grip of identification. Try this practice: at the end of each day, identify one thing you clung to - an opinion, an outcome, a preference - and consciously release it. Ask yourself: \"What would remain of me if this were taken away?\" The one who truly knows this tree, says Krishna, is the knower of the Vedas. True wisdom is not just understanding your world, but understanding its source and your relationship to that source."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 15. We have seen in last two chapters the nature of Prakriti. Chapter 15 is Purushottami Yoga, Yoga of the Supreme Purusha. So now we are learning about the nature of Purusha. So the chapter begins with explaining the tree of Sansar. That Sansar which I find it very real and that which I consider is the real reality is explained in the first three verses.\n\nSo it's a Urdhvamoolaha Adashakaha. The allegory used is of a tree because it exponentially growing. Just like a tree grows over a period of time. So this tree of my Sansar is growing exponentially. But its real picture given here is Urdhvamoolaha. The source of this tree is up above and the branches are below and the leaves are below.\n\nThis tree of Sansar is growing in this world with the branches spreading all over. The more I know about this Sansar, the more this tree grows. The more I know about things and beings, the more my Sansaar grows -- networking more people. The more people I know, the more my network grows. The more people I have relationships with.\n\nMy network grows in this world. The Veda -- the knowledge -- increases my Sansaar, and as my Sansaar increases, I start developing roots, not knowing what my real source is, because the source is unavailable for me to see. So I develop roots here. The more actions and experiences I have, the more roots grow here. So the actions are creating new channels in this world and then establishing me in this Sansar.\n\nI start thinking this is where I come from. I cannot find my real source. So I consider this Sansar as my source. So my roots are now growing in this world. And Bhagavan said that Naarupam Ashya iha Tatha Upalambita. Its overall form is not available to me.\n\nI cannot figure out how this Sansaar started and how I got entangled into it. Naantah Nachadhi Nacha Samprateshta. I cannot figure out where it started, where it's going to end, and how it is rooted in this world. Asvattam Enam Suvirudamulam -- if you want to know the overall picture, we have learned before: one who knows both, he is the Veda Vida. One who knows the source and the Sansaar.\n\nOne who knows the Purusha and Prakriti together is the Veda Vit -- he is the knower of the Vedas. We know only part of it, like the Karmakanda, the actions. What we do in this world, we are aware of it, but we consider ourselves to be Gnani. But one says that's only partial knowledge. That's what is actually binding me to this world.\n\nBecause I don't have complete knowledge. Veda describes both the Purusha and Prakriti. Therefore one who knows both is the Veda Vida. To become a Veda knower, you have to go beyond this perception of Prakriti. Only with the weapon of non-attachment can I understand what is binding me to this world.\n\nWhat will release me from this world and give me the overall picture is detachment. Therefore, with that weapon of detachment, firmly cut this tree. Tathaha Padam Tat Parim ar Gita Vyam Yasmin Gadhana Nivardanti Bhuyah. This statement comes over and over again in our scriptures. Tasmin Gada na Navaratanti Bhuyaha. One who goes there, he never comes back.\n\nBecause this life is just one small part of our existence. Our existence is infinite. It started when the world started and will continue till the world ends. This life is just a small sliver of my existence. So I'm trying to resolve all my issues during this lifetime.\n\nBut you say it will be nothing but a continuation. End of this life will not be the end of anything. End of the life will be just a milestone. Move on to the next mile. But if I really want to resolve all that I want to resolve in this life, I need to go to a place where I don't have to come back again and again to resolve my issues. My issues are I'm trying to avoid unhappiness.\n\nI'm trying to go beyond sorrows. He said that can only happen if you go to a place where there are no sorrows or where there is no mortality. That place, that goal should be sought. Right now I'm seeking goals which are temporarily giving me happiness. My accomplishments, my acquirements, all these things are giving me happiness, but temporarily. So he said, if you want to go there, then you have to seek that goal.\n\nNow what is that goal? Tamevacha Adhyam Purusam Prapadyam Yat Pravrutvicha, Prasuta Purani. Then now I seek refuge in that primeval Purusha, that original source from which stream forth all the ancient activity. The real source of this activity, the Sansar, is the Purusha. Unless I'm conscious about my Jagat, my Jagat does not exist. Unless you are conscious, your Jagat, your Jagat does not exist.\n\nThis world exists as it is because we are aware of it. Bhagavan said from that source, the consciousness is the source from which all the activity started. My Jagat comes into being as soon as I become aware of it. If I'm not aware of it, it does not exist for me. So Bhagavan said that seek that place from which all the activities started, that consciousness. So he said, now my goal is that I seek refuge in that primeval Purusha from which all the activities have started.\n\nSo we have defined the goal. We have defined the Sansar. The Sansar seem like roots are here. As we say, wherever we settle down, we form our roots. So now that I'm in Richmond, my roots are in Richmond. I have forgotten all about my previous roots.\n\nPeople come from Northern Virginia. I don't have time for them. I come from India, but I go back and I feel uncomfortable there. All your formative years in your life were here. And suddenly you feel uncomfortable because you are detached from those roots. The things which we used to find so common, we can find anymore because we keep changing where we establish ourselves.\n\nBut once you establish yourself into your original source source, then you will not have to move around. We establish the goal that I need to take refuge in that primeval Purusha, the original source. And my original source, as I know is, everything that I know is because I'm aware of it. My consciousness is the source of all my experiences. My entire Jagat exists because I'm conscious. So I want to take refuge in that.\n\nSo then the next verse gives us the qualifications to be achieved -- or, when will I be able to achieve that state? It says: nirmana moha, jita sangha dosha, adhyatma nitya, vinivratta kamah, dvandvaihi vimuktaha, sukha dukha sangaihi gacchanti amudhaha padam avyayam tat. The six qualifications given here are something similar to what we have learned before, all throughout the Bhagavad Gita. And we have concluded already: not possible. We right away said, this is not possible for us. So we move on to the next chapter.\n\nSo first is Nirmana Moha -- the one who is free from pride and delusion. Mana and Moha: both relate to my assessment of my situation, and typically my assessment is overly liberal about myself. So Bhagavan said, Moha -- that over-assessment of myself -- creates the delusion about my importance. Once I have the correct assessment of myself, then I will not have the delusion. So Mana, my importance -- I can say, without me the world cannot function, my company cannot function.\n\nI don't know what will happen if I'm not there tomorrow. This society cannot function unless I do this. That wrong perception that I am so important creates the situation which makes me unhappy. In the end all this impurities because of the attachment. My attachment creates the false perception. As we said, the people we like, no matter what they do, it's okay.\n\nThe same event if you watch on Fox News will be completely different than if you watch on MSNBC. The country is divided into two: those who watch Fox News and those who watch MSNBC. This is because of Sangha -- attachment. That attachment creates dosha, a false perception of reality. So maybe you have to watch CNN instead.\n\nSo it is my attachment which is creating false perception which is creating dosha in my perception. Therefore Jita Sanga Dosha 1 is victorious over attachment and the stain which comes with it. Adhatma nityaha established in the self. Our mind obviously have to have something to attach to. Our mind cannot stay without any object to think about. Mind does not exist if you don't think about anything.\n\nTherefore, in deep sleep there is no mind because there are no objects. In my deep sleep, I don't exist. In deep sleep, the world does not exist. The mind does not exist in deep sleep. As soon as I wake up, the mind rises because all the things which I associate with come into its perception -- my house, my car, my family, my work, my job.\n\nVery first moment in the mind is active. So all this talk about jita sangha do saha I say not going to happen. Because more I try to avoid attachment, I get attached more. So Bhagavan said then you have to create an attachment which is so powerful that no other attachment can touch you. That attachment with your own self Adhyatmanity. Constantly remembering that I'm not this body, not this mind, not this intellect.\n\nThese are my equipment. This world is temporary but myself is permanent. That constant churning in your mind will give you the ability to detach from Other things. So adhyatma nitya -- then you are free from desires. My memory bank is the root cause of all the problems. That's why when we see somebody, we don't see him or her as they are right now.\n\nRight now we remember everything. Our encounter with that person in the past. If the memory bank said the encounter was good, the person is good. The memory encounter wasn't that pleasant. The person is not good. So this memory bank creates ideas and then it creates a desire and the mind starts longing for it.\n\nIf we stop power of this memory bank to guide our perceptions, Bhagwanji will see things as they are. If I can judge a person from the day I'm looking at him it will be very different than all the baggage of all my experiences with him before. If you judge him from what he does today then it will be a very different perception. Even the person who is a big criminal. But once he resolved to be good, he should be considered good. Because he should be judged on what he's doing today not what he has done in the past.\n\nBut we obviously cannot function that way. We have to find all his resume, what he did in the past, and then only can we judge people. Bhagavan said, vinivrutta kamaha -- if you don't do that, there won't be any desire to do anything which is not appropriate. Dvandvai vimuktaha -- we have learned this over and over again. It is the most difficult concept to understand: being beyond pairs of opposites.\n\nThat does not mean the pairs of opposites go away. Pairs of opposites remain as they are. Sukha du kha mana apman they all remain exactly where they are. Winter and summer all those things remain. But I become indifferent to them. That's a dvandvai hi vimuktaha.\n\nJust like in the last chapter we have learned what is the first quality of a guna titaha. He's a Gunatidha one he does not despise when the gunas are present. Also he does not long for them and they are not present when Tamas is there and despise and seek sattva. But I take them as they are and not get attached to them. So therefore he said dhvandvayihi vimukta he is not affected by one or the other.",
      "reflection": "These verses reveal both the destination and the qualifications needed to reach it. \"Yasmin gata na nivartanti bhuyah\" - having gone there, one never returns. This is not a place in space but a state of being where the cycle of seeking, finding, losing, and seeking again finally ends. The primeval Purusha from which all activity has sprung forth is described as the ultimate refuge. Today, notice how much of your energy goes into seeking temporary refuges - in accomplishments, relationships, entertainment - only to find yourself seeking again tomorrow. What would it mean to seek refuge in the source itself?\n\nThe qualifications listed - freedom from pride and delusion (nirmana-moha), victory over attachment (jita-sanga-dosha), constant abidance in the Self (adhyatma-nitya), freedom from desires (vinivrtta-kamah), and liberation from the pairs of opposites (dvandvair-vimuktah) - may seem impossibly high. But verse six offers hope: that supreme abode is not illumined by sun, moon, or fire, because it is self-luminous. Your own awareness is that light. Practice this: when you feel buffeted by life's dualities - praise and blame, success and failure - pause and ask: \"Who is aware of both? Who remains unchanged?\" That unchanging witness is a doorway to the place from which there is no return."

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 15, Purushottam Yoga, Yoga of the Supreme Purusha, the Supreme Being. In chapter 15, we have started out by realizing that my own source -- when I look at my life story, when I look at where I came from and what my world is -- it seems like Bhagavan says it's an upside-down tree. It seems like my source is somewhere up above. I right now cannot perceive where it is. Somewhere beyond my cognition, somewhere beyond my understanding, is my source. Urdhva Mulaha Adhah Sakaha.\n\nMy source is somewhere up above, but the branches and the leaves are in this world. And then it also seems like my roots are now getting established in this world. This is how I see myself and my world. I cannot find my source somewhere beyond my cognition, somewhere beyond my understanding. The self which I considered me has a source which I cannot recognize. And then we have seen that Bhagavan said that the perception of that is unavailable.\n\nKnowledge of my source, of that supreme Being is unavailable to most of us. But those who have achieved that sense of equanimity, nirmoha nisanga, those qualities which you have seen, jita sangha do saha, who have got over this evil of attachment, all these qualities which they have achieved, to them it is available the self which is immutable, imperishable. They recognize that the self in me is the self everywhere. Self in me, the self in everyone else. There is no other existence other than my own self. However, at this time it is not available to me and I have become the individualized ego.\n\nIt refers to my body, my mind, my intellect. So the verses which we have seen say, how did that happen? The ones who have the knowledge about the self, they know that the source -- that Urdhva Mulaha, that source -- is in a place where there is no sun shining, no moon shining, no light of fire there. But once reaching that state, no one ever comes back. I particularly, right now, cannot see that as my world or myself. So how did that come about?\n\nThis ignorance came about. So Verse seven says: Mama Eva Amsha Jiva Loke Jiva Bhutah Sanatanah. An eternal portion of mine, establishing in this world of beings, associating itself with the world of beings, becomes a Jiva -- Jiva Bhutah. When I associate myself with the India Association, I become one of the members of the India Association, just like every other member. I associate myself with Chinmaya Mission; I become a Chinmaya Mission member just like all other members.\n\nSo when this Supreme also associates with the Jiva Loka, the Prakriti, he becomes one of the Prakriti. He becomes one of them. He becomes the Jiva Bhuta, associating with the world of beings. As we know, we have learned in chapter 13 that Bhagavan told Arjuna: \"Idam shariram kaunteya kshetram iti abhidhiyate.\" This body is considered to be the field, which is the Prakriti. And the one who knows this field is the knower of the field. So at my individual level, this field, the Prakriti, is the body.\n\nOne who knows is the knower. Knower is the Purusha. Purusha functioning through the Prakriti. We have seen in the 14th chapter the qualities of the Prakriti. The Prakriti has three gunas. These gunas bind this Purusha to the Prakriti Satvaraja Santamas.\n\nSo right now myself, the consciousness in me, is bound by this body, mind and intellect -- by the qualities, the gunas of the body, mind and intellect. Now our goal in this chapter is to understand the nature of the Purusha. Therefore we are going through this exercise of knowing: what is the nature of the Prakriti? What is the nature of the Purusha? So how did this ignorance come about? That is basically our goal.\n\nSo he said, Bhagavan said Mama Eva asa a portion of mine eternal portion. Because once we say, the portion may be separated from that whole or something which once it gets separated, maybe get destroyed. This portion eternal of mine. Something which cannot be divisible but seem to be divided. We have seen the classic example of this space outside the room. Space is indivisible.\n\nNo matter how much we try, you cannot divide the space. However, it does seem divided between this room and that room -- this space, the kitchen, the bathrooms. And because of the conditioning, in a similar manner, the supreme being, even though indivisible, seems like a portion of it is divided from it and now, associated with the Prakriti, becomes a jiva. Once it is now associated with Prakriti and becomes a jiva, Bhagavan said: Manah Shashthani Indriyani Prakriti Sthani Karshati.\n\nOnce abiding in this Prakriti, it attracts or obtains the five senses and the manas. So now it has its own identity as this limited self, associated with those six things it obtained, which we call jiva. Those six are considered the internal instrument, or Antahkarana. Bahishkarana is this body; Antahkarana, the six things. The Jiva, that consciousness, acquired its own equipment. And the next verse says, what is now the relationship with that equipment which is obtained by the portion of the jiva? So for example, in this case, this room space is acquired.\n\nThe length and breadth and height of this room, this nature of this wall, floor and ceiling, they would define this room. And I'm leasing this room. In the lease I write down, this room is 20ft by 14ft. So many square feet has height of 8ft. Total volume is this. That's how the rent is decided.\n\nBut it is defined by what? By the wall, floor and ceiling. So now the Jiva defines itself as a limited being by the mind and the five senses, the six. So that's its equipment to function with the other jivas. It's called antahkarana. Next the verse says: Sariram Yat ava apnuthi, Yaatschaapi utkramati, Ishvaraha.\n\nSo this consciousness is now the Ishvara of my self. My consciousness is the Lord of my being. As long as I am conscious, I can speak, I can hear, I can touch, I can smell, I can taste. All this is possible only because of the consciousness in me. And therefore consciousness is my Lord. This Lord, when it obtains the body -- this gross body is something different from the mind and senses which we are describing. It obtained this body as a vehicle, where it requires one.\n\nI have software, but my computer is now broken. All I need is new hardware. Now when it obtains a body, Yat chapi utkramati. When it leaves the body, it takes this subtle body with it. Now five senses, not the sense organs, the senses. I can see only when the mind is there.\n\nSo sometimes we are gazing but not seeing. We have all heard this before. We are hearing but not listening. Because although the equipment is functioning properly, the translator -- the mind -- is not there. The experiencer, the mind, is not there. This experiencer, the translator, is the internal instrument.\n\nThis verse says, when this Ishvara, the consciousness, right now, conditioned by this mind and senses, it leaves this body and obtains the body what it does. Grihitva etani samyati vayu gandha nivashayat. Just as air moves from one place to another, it carries the fragrance of the things which it touches, it carries with it. So that's why sometimes the air smells good when the air freshener. And if there is a toilet not properly cleaned, that smell also come through. Air does not discriminate.\n\nIt carries all of whatever comes with it. In the same way, the Ishvara, the consciousness, when it leaves this body or obtains a new body, it carries these six like a fragrance. Not in any fashion an actual experience, not in any fashion an actual sense organ, but just the fragrance of what it has experienced, it carries with it. Therefore, when we move from one body to another, Bhagavan says, what carries those vasanas? Vasa Gandha -- fragrance, vasanas. This collective accumulation of my experiences is the tendencies. So this verse clearly says how the jiva was created.\n\nThe eternal portion, one portion of this whole supreme being identifying with this mind and intellect, becomes a jiva, conditioned consciousness. Now this conditioned consciousness, its own identity. Now it wants to exercise its desires and vasanas through a body. As long as it acquires the body, it unbundles the vasanas and start functioning. So some child, right from the beginning, shows a tendency for music, a tendency for dance, a tendency for mathematics, whatever that is. And some show a tendency for boxing -- because those vasanas are carried with it, at least according to our shastras.\n\nSo when it leaves one body and obtains another, the body is like a temporary abode. The jiva takes over the body and uses it as long as it is functional. When the body is no longer functional, it moves on to the next one, carrying those vasanas -- those collective experiences and tendencies -- with it. The next verse says: Shotram Chakshuhus parsanam charasanam granam evacha Adhisthaya Manishchayam, vishaya anupasevate. So what happens when the jiva takes a new body? This jiva, the conditioned consciousness, having its own tendencies, unbundles those tendencies and uses this body to fulfill those desires, acting in the field which is appropriate for this.\n\nSo Bhagavan said: Shrotram -- presiding over the ear; Chakshuh -- the eyes; Sparshanam -- the touch with the skin; Rasanam -- taste; Ghranam -- smell; and also the mind. This consciousness, presiding over these five senses and the mind, now enjoys -- Vishayan Upasevate. He now enjoys the sense objects. I somehow want to go and get some music and enjoy it. You want to go and get ESPN and enjoy the sport. Depending on your vasana.\n\nThe last verse says: Utkramantam sthitam va api bhunjanam va gunanvitam, vimudha na anupashyanti, pashyanti gnana chakshushah. Utkramantam -- while leaving; sthitam -- while it is staying in this body; api bhunjanam va gunanvitam -- or enjoying by association with the gunas. This consciousness in me, which is the Lord of my being, I do not recognize if I'm ignorant about it. I'm not recognizing that the one who is enjoying is someone other than my body. The one who is thinking is something other than my mind.\n\nOne who has the knowledge is something other than my intellect. I as the deluded person. Deluded in a sense that I do not have sense of reality. Deluded doesn't mean something. Someone who does not have sense of reality is deluded. So when David Cooperfield shows us that the Statue of Liberty is disappearing, we are not stupid, but we are deluded by his trick, by his illusion.\n\nSo one who is deluded doesn't know how that thing is happening. David Copperfield and his staff know exactly how it is happening, because they have Gnana Chakshu. They know exactly how this thing is being done. We, on the other hand, the television viewers, do not know it. Therefore to us it's a wonderment how this thing is happening.\n\nThe one who is not educated in this -- Vimudha Na Anupashyanti -- does not see that the Ishvara, the enjoyer of all this, is the consciousness in me. Consciousness in me is the controller of the senses, mind, and all these transactions taking place in my life. Pashyanti Gnana Chakshushah -- but one whose eyes of knowledge are opened, one who has understood how this thing is working, he sees this. And therefore, what he seeks as his goal -- even when he was deluded, even when I'm deluded right now, still the motive, my goal, is that I want peace.",
      "reflection": "\"Mamaivamsho jivaloke jivabhutah sanatanah\" - an eternal portion of Myself becomes the jiva in this world of beings. This is one of the most profound declarations in the Gita. You are not separate from the Divine; you are an eternal fragment that has become conditioned by association with mind and senses. Like space confined by walls becoming \"room space,\" your infinite nature has taken on the appearance of limitation. The beautiful metaphor of wind carrying fragrance illustrates how the subtle body - your accumulated tendencies and impressions - travels from life to life, just as breeze carries the scent of flowers. Consider: what fragrances are you cultivating? What vasanas will your consciousness carry forward?\n\nThe verse says this Ishvara (the Lord within) presides over the ear, eye, touch, taste, smell, and mind, enjoying sense objects through them. This means that every experience you have is actually the Divine experiencing through you. Today, try this contemplation: as you see, hear, taste, touch, or smell anything, remind yourself that consciousness is the true experiencer, not the sense organs. The deluded do not recognize this truth - they think the body-mind is the enjoyer. But the wise, with the eye of knowledge (jnana-chakshusah), see that the same consciousness that animates you animates all beings. What would change in your interactions today if you truly saw every person as an eternal portion of the same Divine?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 15, Purushottam yoga, yoga of the Supreme Spirit, the Supreme Purusha. We have talked about Prakriti. The Prakriti has three aspects, the Sattva, rajas and Tamas. And this permutation combination of the Sattva, Rajas and Tamas create this multiplicity in this world. When we associate with it, it creates a sansar I in the world. In that relationship, we get lost.\n\nAnd that relationship creates either the conducive experience or not conducive experience. Some gives us joy and some gives us unhappiness. So that's our Sansar. In that Sansar, we try to understand through various ways, to understand what gives me happiness, how can I achieve the permanent happiness. So, as we have seen before, our entire life is divided into two pursuits. One is to achieve happiness and other is to avoid unhappiness.\n\nSo this chapter starts with saying, well, let's understand how your Sansar starts. In the first place, place, it seems like it is rooted here, but its source is up above. Up above, in other sense, there's something which is beyond my perception, something which is beyond my understanding. From that source, this sansar grows and it is nourished by the Veda, the leaves and branches. The more I know about this sansar, more it grows, more I know about any subject, it becomes more and more complex. And even though my knowledge grows, my insecurity increases.\n\nThat there may be even a lot more that I do not know. The more we know about the atom, the less we know about the reality of what the atom actually is. In physics, when knowledge was limited, people could say, \"Well, I have understood everything and there is nothing more to be known.\" But the more we know, the more complex it becomes. This Sansaar is like that. This Sansaar is the theme of all scriptural advice and practices.\n\nSo this chapter tries to make this very clear to us: remaining in the Sansaar, getting attached to the Sansaar, will never give us what we seek. So the very first advice in this chapter says, with the strong axe of detachment, cut this tree of Sansaar. Detach yourself from this Sansaar. This is the only way to achieve that permanent happiness which you are seeking. And then we have discussed what is the nature of that self.\n\nIf I detach from this sensa, what am I getting attached to? You are getting attached to that supreme self. Having gone there, non returns. Once you have achieved that identification, there won't be any delusion. You will never come back to this ignorance. So as we had seen before, this Maya is created out of ignorance.\n\nMaya is called Maya because it gives an appearance of something that which is not. I always give the example of David Copperfield, and I thought he must have disappeared somewhere. But he was in the news a few days ago. He was in a courtroom explaining how the illusion works. So this is the first time he has had to give the secret out in open court -- how he does that illusion -- because somebody got hurt. So it is an illusion.\n\nBut till we know how it happens, it's a mystery for us. So this Sansaar is like that illusion -- even though it seems so real, we all come to understand from the scriptures that it is an illusion. It is the Maya, and we want to get out of this illusion. Once we understand, then anytime David Copperfield performs his act, we will not be in much confusion. We know what's happening there. If you have that vision of both at the same time, you've got it made.\n\nSo therefore, the one who understands both -- one who can see this Sansaar and the source of Sansaar -- he knows what the reality is. To get out of this ignorance in which we think this Sansaar is so real, you have to develop some mental capabilities. And we have seen those qualities: Nirmana moha, Jita sanga dosha.\n\nOne who is beyond the pride and whatever the opposite of that. And also jita sangha do saha who has a victory over attachment. We are trying to achieve that. But then we also want to understand what is the nature of myself. Then what is it that now considers that I as I am? And what is the relationship between the supreme self?\n\nSo we have learned that Mama Evamsha Jiva Loke Jiva Bhutah. The world of individual beings, where each one considers himself or herself to be an individual. We all consider ourselves to be a very complete individual, independent of each other. That's our general understanding. We think that I am by myself and the world is out there to compete with me. It's actually the other way around.\n\nI am there because the world is there. But that's never clear in our mind. So when one makes the connections, there's an all-pervading supreme self which acts as the source of all beings. When it comes to me as the individual, only a portion of that self associates with this mind and intellect. It basically, as we have seen, draws the five senses and mind from the Prakriti.\n\nSo everything that I consider myself right now belongs to the Prakriti. My mind, my intellect, my body. And we have seen previously in detail how this works. That the body is made of the grossified element. The five elements which has come into it gross forms. So you can identify them as five different elements.\n\nAnd also we know where it comes from and where it goes. We know that the body is made of food. It's very simple for us to really follow this food chain. When I digested, it became my body. When I die, the same body will become food for somebody else. And the cycle continues.\n\nWhat is not simple for us is to understand the subtle body. We always thought that my consciousness, my mind and my intellect are the thinkers who think. So we consider that as our real self, which is driving this body to do what it does. The distinction made here is that those are also part of the Prakriti, the inert nature. Nature is inert in all forms. It becomes sentient by association with the consciousness.\n\nJust like we know for sure that my eye cannot see. I know now very much. I know more about eye than I'm supposed to know. You know it basically no different than my glasses. So at least previously I had a God's given lens inside. Now I have both acrylic lenses on both sides and they are shifted.\n\nThe guy said, don't worry about it. So it is no different than any other thing which breaks down in my house, my clothes or whatever. You can repair it and make it good again. So this body, mind and intellect are from this inert world. It becomes sentient only when it is associated with the consciousness. As long as I am aware, my eye can see.\n\nAnd I am not aware of what's happening around my eye cannot see. We are seeing but not registering that what is there. Or we are hearing but not listening. Because the mind is not there. And the mind itself also cannot do anything, because it is made up of inert material.\n\nVedanta says that before these five elements were grossified, those five elements existed in their primordial state, which they call tanmatra. From these tanmatras, the mind and intellect are made. Those are still inert equipment, just like our body. But when the consciousness shines on that mind and intellect, then mind and intellect become capable of interpreting the experience which is happening. Only when consciousness is present and aware can I see and can my mind interpret -- even when I am alive. But when I am in deep sleep, the mind and intellect are in a dormant state because consciousness is not available to them.\n\nTherefore the mind cannot interpret any experience in deep sleep. Therefore I wake up and say \"I don't know what happened.\" That \"I don't know\" and \"I know\" is my entire world. So the avidya is the root cause of my confusion about who I am. Avidya is part of Maya. So that avidya -- \"I don't know\" -- will associate with the Purusha, which is all knowledge.\n\nThat portion of me comes to say \"I know.\" And that \"I know\" creates the notion that I, the individual, know. So now I have created an entity called jiva. That jiva -- the consciousness identifying with the mind and intellect, considering itself to be an entity by itself, which is capable of knowing. So that jiva, when associated with the atma, which is the pure consciousness, is called jivatma. Mind and intellect identifying itself as an entity, associating with the consciousness, creates jivatma.\n\nThis jivatma remains intact as long as the conditionings are there. The standard example: the room space. The space was always here. But this very fact that space was here attracted somebody to build a building. Some developer who has an idea to create a building sees this space and says, \"I can build a building here.\" So this space, by its very existence, attracted walls and floor and ceiling into this space. Now it has created a room space -- now it's the conditioned space.\n\nSo as long as this conditioning remains, the room space remains. This mind and intellect, once they come in association with the consciousness, identify with the limited consciousness which is reflecting through them and become a jivatma. This jivatma experiences this world through those five senses and the mind. Then we have seen that when this self leaves this body, one thing is sure -- we have seen people dying. So it follows that I will die too.\n\nSo what happens at the time of death is always a mystery to us. Bhagavan clarifies here that what happens here is that jivatma will leave this body carrying the fragrance with it off all the experiences and tendencies, all the fragrance of the mind and intellect which it has experienced through the senses, it will go with it. So Atmabodha actually describes the subtle body. What dies is only the gross body. The subtle body leaves as jivatma because it is constantly identifying with the consciousness which is all-pervading. It's like a mobile home or a car.\n\nThe space inside the car is identified with the car, but it's not actually different from the space outside. It can move from here to Hanover County, and still the car space remains -- it moved from Germany to the United States, and it's still the same car space. But now we know from our overall perspective, it's not the same space when it is here versus there. If the space belonged to Henrico, it's the space belonging to Henrico; if in Hanover, it belongs to Hanover. But because the conditioning is moving, and the space is omnipresent.\n\nWherever the conditioning moves, the identification moves with it. This jivatma associating with all pervading consciousness. When it moves from one body to another, it still identifies itself as an entity that is called a subtle body living so. So subtle body is the only thing which survives my death. And that subtle body is described in atma bodha. There are 17 elements: five pranas, ten senses -- pancha prana, dasha indriya -- that's 15.\n\nThen mind and intellect make 17. These 17 remain as a subtle body -- not exactly the way we understand today. So not my physical eye is going to go, but the capacity and ability to remember that experience will go along with it, and that will then start its journey again. When I look at this experience, I think that when I die, my existence will end. So the verses we have seen say: Utkramantam sthitam va api bhunjanam va gunanvitam, vimudha na anupashyanti, pashyanti gnana chakshushah.",
      "reflection": "These verses draw a stark contrast between the deluded and the wise. The ignorant (vimudha) do not perceive the Self even as it departs at death, dwells in the body, or enjoys experiences through the gunas. Like watching a magic show without understanding the mechanism, we remain mystified by life's appearances. But those with the \"eye of knowledge\" (jnana-chakshusah) see the truth. The yogis who strive with purified minds perceive the Self established within themselves, while those with unprepared minds, despite their efforts, cannot perceive it. Ask yourself honestly: am I striving with a prepared mind, or am I expecting results without the inner work?\n\nVerse 12 offers a magnificent contemplation: the light of the sun that illumines the whole world, the light in the moon, the light in fire - all proceed from the Supreme. This is not poetic metaphor but a profound teaching about the nature of reality. Every light you see is borrowed light, reflecting that one original consciousness. Practice this today: when you see sunlight streaming through a window, when you notice moonlight, when you see a flame - pause and remember \"tat tejo viddhi mamakam\" - know that brilliance to be Mine. Let every source of illumination become a reminder that your own awareness, which makes all perception possible, is that same divine light manifesting through you."

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 15, Purushottama Yoga, Yoga of the Supreme Being. And so far we have seen Bhagavan saying that everything that you see, everything that you can perceive, and everything that you can experience is nothing but me. In the last few verses we have seen he said: the light which is from the sun, which illumines this entire world of yours, is nothing but my light -- it comes from me alone. The light from the moon which nourishes the plants is nothing but my own light. And the fertility in this soil which supports all the beings on this planet is nothing but me. My mind, my intellect, which is aware of this world --\n\nThat awareness comes from him. And this world which I experience also comes from him. Then he says, not only that this being is supported by me, but all this functions within the sentient beings which makes them living beings. I support those functions. Aham Vaishva Narobhatva Prani Namdha Masridha. Residing in the bodies of all the beings, I digest these four types of food.\n\nBasically, as I said, our ancestors were fond of classification, so they always have some classification. Foods are of four types. And once you look at what the four types of foods are, there's nothing left out. So any food that a being can eat, it gets digested. Bhagavan said, by me residing in this body as this eternal fire, this internal fire. So everything I see, everything I hear, everything I experience -- there is really nothing other than the Lord.\n\nAnd this somewhat, if you really think logically fits into the normal belief, a normal declaration in all religion that the God is omnipresent. Once something we have taken as omnipresent, there is no room left for anything else. So if we say that God is omnipresent in this world, then there is no room for you and I as an individual other than God. As we have discussed so many times from the physics perspective, if I say I am omnipresent in my chair, there is no room for anything else or anybody else. So now everything in this chair has to be me. Whether it's my leg, it's my hand, my torso, whatever, it's all me.\n\nSo Bhagavan said, I am omnipresent. And therefore all the experiences illumined by your consciousness is nothing but me alone. So we have so far seen Bhagavan is giving his identity. What is the identity of the supreme Being? That there is none other than that being exist. So the last verse 14 we say prani nam deha masirithah prana pana samayukta Pachami annam Chaturvedam.\n\nI can see at the macro level that the Lord is everywhere. At the micro level, the Lord is also in my body. This body, mind and intellect come from this world. This world is nothing but his expression. But the functions within me -- which I think differentiate me from the insentient world called matter -- make me consider myself as something completely different than matter.\n\nThat's why my body is so spatial. Because I don't think it's a matter. I consider that's me. But that me from the matter to me is because of these functions which makes me a living being. These pranas and apanas, all these activities happening in my body. And Bhagawan says that also I control by living in your body.\n\nIn the next verse it says, Sarvasya chaham Hrudhisan niveshtah matthaha smriti gnanam upo hanamcha vedeshcha sarve ham eva vedyo vedantakrut veda Videva chaham. So what is my relationship to the Lord now? He said, I am residing in the hearts of all beings. How do I know? This great Lord is everywhere, and that may overwhelm my intellect. I am a seeker seeking my experience or realization of my Lord. Now he says, the light of the sun is me, the light of the moon is me.\n\nI am the fertility in the earth. Then we give up and say, I will never be able to reach him. Somebody says, \"Neil, if you want to do something, why don't you call up the President?\" If you tell me to call a project manager, I can think about it. But make a cold call to the President of the United States, Barack Obama?\n\nThat really doesn't sound like a practical thing to do. So we say, well, if Bhagavan is so supreme, then there is no way that I'll ever be able to get connected with him. So now Bhagawan said, no, that's not the truth. The truth is I'm residing in the hearts of all beings. Sarvasenni, Vistaha, Matthaha, Smrutihi, Gnanam and Upohanam. Because I'm residing in the hearts of all beings.\n\nAnd because of me they have a memory. Because of me they have knowledge. And because of me they have forgetfulness or ignorance. Everything which I know today is because of my consciousness. I'm aware of my experiences, so it becomes my memory. I'm aware of what I have learned.\n\nSo my memory has become my knowledge. If somebody says what month comes after January? Well, I learned in kg, it's February. That's nothing but my memory. I consider that as my knowledge. But it's actually my memory.\n\nAll this, Bhagavan said, comes from me. I will only remember if I'm conscious. Without that, I won't. But more important than this knowledge is also forgetfulness. If I remember everything that happened, there won't be any room for me to learn anything new. The IT guys were telling me, \"Neil, our server is really getting to capacity now.\"\n\nWe had been in business for 12 years and we keep piling all this data on it. I think it's a time for you to change the server. It's 80% capacity you really have to have. So I said, well, I'll tell you what. We can't really afford a new server right now. Purge all the old projects which are done five years ago.\n\nI don't need them anymore. Purge them so I can put new projects onto my server. Forgetfulness is the gift from God to us. If we don't forget, we will not be able to learn anything new. All the bad memories of our childhood literally get erased from us. That's why we also recall our childhood as so good.\n\nMy college days were so good. Because the bad memories are erased. What you remember is all the fun you had. Now there are some bad memories that remain there. But most of it get erased. So I had a nice childhood when I was growing up.\n\nBecause the Bhagavan has given a gift of forgetting things which is not useful to you. Forgetting things which removes all the unnecessary ignorance out of your mind. So you can fill that void with new knowledge. Sarvasya Chaham Rudhisa Nivestaha. I am residing in the hearts of all. So we obviously in my heart Bhagavan is here.\n\nSwamiji makes it clear. And obviously you and I can logically say \"heart\" is not that physiological organ literally pumping the blood. It is the core of my being. What I consider \"me\" is my heart. What is at the heart of Richmond city?\n\nWhat is at the heart of this community? What I consider the core of my being. Bhagavan said, I reside there. The core of my being is my awareness about me. My awareness about me, makes me who I am. That has these good qualities about compassion, charity, love.\n\nBut once I decide in there, when my God is invoked then I will have this good quality manifest. When I am in a divine mood, then I will have love, compassion, charity, all the good qualities. When I am forgetting about my Lord, my being, then I will have all the negative qualities. Because those negative qualities are the product of my ignorance. I hate somebody, I'm evil to someone. All these things are because of the lack of my connection with my core of my being, my heart, my Lord who makes me who I am.\n\nSo Bhagavan says, Sarvasyacham, Hrudhi Sanniveshtah. I am residing in all the beings at the core of their heart. When I am really aware of myself, I can only manifest my divine qualities -- love, compassion, charity. Whatever the good qualities we think of. It's only when I'm devoid of those connections that I will have jealousy, hatred. He said, Matthaha Smritih.\n\nBecause of me is the memory. Because of me is the knowledge. Because I'm aware of myself, I have a memory. Because I'm aware of myself, I have a knowledge. And because I'm aware of myself, I have forgetfulness. I am also our ignorance.\n\nI am as much aware of my knowledge as I am aware of my ignorance. \"Neel, do you know medicine?\" \"No, I know nothing about it.\" \"Do you know architecture?\" \"Yes, tell me all about it.\" I am aware of my knowledge. I am also aware of my ignorance.\n\nBhagavan said, it's all because of my presence in you, the consciousness. I reside in you as your being. I am the Vedas and I am that needs to be known. I am the author of the Vedanta and knower of the Vedas. Now Vedas, as we have seen, they are our scriptures. What do they represent?\n\nThey represent knowledge. The knowledge compiled by the sages becomes Veda. This knowledge encompass everything. Utilitarian knowledge as well as the divine knowledge, secular as well as sacred. Now the secular knowledge obviously also come from my awareness. I learn things and I use it.\n\nI am all this knowledge that is out there. And I am only the one to be known. And Veda in the end says what? The only thing to be known is your own self. Once you realize yourself, there is nothing more to be known. Having reached that place, we have learned that no one comes back.\n\nThat's what Veda says. That's what Vedanta said. In the end of Veda, the section which deals with the Upanishads and the knowledge about yourself is called Vedanta. So who gave this knowledge of the self to the Rishis? Bhagavan said, I did. And therefore there is no authorship in our Vedas of who wrote this Vedanta.\n\nThere is no authorship because it is a revealed knowledge. That is what is remembered. So I can say I thought about it many times. Honestly, I can tell you, I give some examples in my lectures. And I really sometimes feel good that I really thought about really neat example. Then I read Swamiji's commentary and I find the exact same example in it.\n\nI said, how did that happen? I thought, I thought about it. What I really forget is I'd been listening to Swamiji since I was 16 years old. So all this thing which I think, I'm thinking fresh, new is literally come from what I heard since I was 16 year old. Now, I may not have understood the time, I may not have got the gist of it at the time, but things stay with you. Then we are really churning on that idea.\n\nThings come out and now you think, I invented this idea. And therefore in Hinduism there is no originality. The only originality is with him. Everything else we do is just relearn. So Bhagavan says, therefore I am the author of Vedanta. Now I am the one to be known.\n\nEverything which I can consider is the quest of my life. If Bhagavan said, is me, know that I am at the core of your being. So how difficult would it be for you to know your core of your being? Not that difficult, Bhagavan said, as long as you turn your gaze towards yourself. So these verses are obviously very contemplative verses and not really intellectual verses, but contemplative verses. But going back to our understanding of what is real, what is unreal, what is transitory or temporary, and what is permanent.",
      "reflection": "These verses reveal the Supreme Person as the sustainer of all existence at every level - cosmic, earthly, and personal. Krishna declares that He enters the earth and sustains all beings with His energy, becomes the moon (Soma) and nourishes all plants with life-giving essence, and as the digestive fire (Vaishvanara) within all living beings, digests the four kinds of food. This teaching dissolves the boundary between sacred and mundane. The very act of digestion happening in your body right now is a divine function. The next time you eat, consider: the fire that transforms food into energy is not merely a biological process but the Lord functioning within you through prana and apana.\n\nVerse 15 is especially intimate: \"Sarvasya chaham hridi sannivishto\" - I am seated in the hearts of all beings. From Me come memory, knowledge, and their removal. This means your capacity to remember, to know, and even to forget is a divine gift. Forgetfulness, often seen as a flaw, is actually a blessing - it allows old wounds to heal and makes room for new learning. The verse concludes by stating that the Lord is what is to be known through all the Vedas, is the author of Vedanta, and the knower of the Vedas. Today, reflect: if the Supreme dwells in my heart as the source of all my knowing, how far do I need to search? Turn your attention inward, to the very awareness that makes all experience possible, and recognize that the goal of all seeking is already present as the seeker."

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 15, Purushottama Yoga, Yoga of the Supreme Being. And so far we have seen Bhagavan saying that everything that you see, everything that you can perceive, and everything that you can experience is nothing but me. In the last few verses we have seen he said: the light which is from the sun, which illumines this entire world of yours, is nothing but my light -- it comes from me alone. The light from the moon which nourishes the plants is nothing but my own light. And the fertility in this soil which supports all the beings on this planet is nothing but me. My mind, my intellect, which is aware of this world --\n\nThat awareness comes from him. And this world which I experience also comes from him. Then he says, not only that this being is supported by me, but all this functions within the sentient beings which makes them living beings. I support those functions. Aham Vaishva Narobhatva Prani Namdha Masridha. Residing in the bodies of all the beings, I digest these four types of food.\n\nBasically, as I said, our ancestors were fond of classification, so they always have some classification. Foods are of four types. And once you look at what the four types of foods are, there's nothing left out. So any food that a being can eat, it gets digested. Bhagavan said, by me residing in this body as this eternal fire, this internal fire. So everything I see, everything I hear, everything I experience -- there is really nothing other than the Lord.\n\nAnd this somewhat, if you really think logically fits into the normal belief, a normal declaration in all religion that the God is omnipresent. Once something we have taken as omnipresent, there is no room left for anything else. So if we say that God is omnipresent in this world, then there is no room for you and I as an individual other than God. As we have discussed so many times from the physics perspective, if I say I am omnipresent in my chair, there is no room for anything else or anybody else. So now everything in this chair has to be me. Whether it's my leg, it's my hand, my torso, whatever, it's all me.\n\nSo Bhagavan said, I am omnipresent. And therefore all the experiences illumined by your consciousness is nothing but me alone. So we have so far seen Bhagavan is giving his identity. What is the identity of the supreme Being? That there is none other than that being exist. So the last verse 14 we say prani nam deha masirithah prana pana samayukta Pachami annam Chaturvedam.\n\nI can see at the macro level the Lord is everywhere. At a micro level also in my body. This body, mind and intellect comes from this world. This world nothing but his expression. But the functions which I think differentiates me from this insentient world called matter. I consider myself something completely different than the matter.\n\nThat's why my body is so spatial. Because I don't think it's a matter. I consider that's me. But that me from the matter to me is because of these functions which makes me a living being. These pranas and apanas, all these activities happening in my body. And Bhagawan says that also I control by living in your body.\n\nIn the next verse it says, Sarvasya chaham Hrudhisan niveshtah matthaha smriti gnanam upo hanamcha vedeshcha sarve ham eva vedyo vedantakrut veda Videva chaham. So what is my relationship to the Lord now? He said, I am residing in the hearts of all beings. How do I know? This great Lord is everywhere, and that may overwhelm my intellect. I am a seeker seeking my experience or realization of my Lord. Now he says, the light of the sun is me, the light of the moon is me.\n\nI am the fertility in the earth. Then we give up and say, I will never be able to reach him. Somebody says, \"Neil, if you want to do something, why don't you call up the President?\" If you tell me to call a project manager, I can think about it. But make a cold call to the President of the United States, Barack Obama?\n\nThat really doesn't sound like a practical thing to do. So we say, well, if Bhagavan is so supreme, then there is no way that I'll ever be able to get connected with him. So now Bhagawan said, no, that's not the truth. The truth is I'm residing in the hearts of all beings. Sarvasenni, Vistaha, Matthaha, Smrutihi, Gnanam and Upohanam. Because I'm residing in the hearts of all beings.\n\nAnd because of me they have a memory. Because of me they have knowledge. And because of me they have forgetfulness or ignorance. Everything which I know today is because of my consciousness. I'm aware of my experiences, so it becomes my memory. I'm aware of what I have learned.\n\nSo my memory has become my knowledge. If somebody says what month comes after January? Well, I learned in kg, it's February. That's nothing but my memory. I consider that as my knowledge. But it's actually my memory.\n\nAll this, Bhagavan said, comes from me. I will only remember if I'm conscious. Without that, I won't. But more important than this knowledge is also forgetfulness. If I remember everything that happened, there won't be any room for me to learn anything new. The IT guys were telling me, \"Neil, our server is really getting to capacity now.\"\n\nWe had been in business for 12 years and we keep piling all this data on it. I think it's a time for you to change the server. It's 80% capacity you really have to have. So I said, well, I'll tell you what. We can't really afford a new server right now. Purge all the old projects which are done five years ago.\n\nI don't need them anymore. Purge them so I can put new projects onto my server. Forgetfulness is the gift from God to us. If we don't forget, we will not be able to learn anything new. All the bad memories of our childhood literally get erased from us. That's why we also recall our childhood as so good.\n\nMy college days were so good. Because the bad memories are erased. What you remember is all the fun you had. Now there are some bad memories that remain there. But most of it get erased. So I had a nice childhood when I was growing up.\n\nBecause the Bhagavan has given a gift of forgetting things which is not useful to you. Forgetting things which removes all the unnecessary ignorance out of your mind. So you can fill that void with new knowledge. Sarvasya Chaham Rudhisa Nivestaha. I am residing in the hearts of all. So we obviously in my heart Bhagavan is here.\n\nSwamiji makes it clear. And obviously you and I can logically say \"heart\" is not that physiological organ literally pumping the blood. It is the core of my being. What I consider \"me\" is my heart. What is at the heart of Richmond city?\n\nWhat is at the heart of this community? What I consider the core of my being. Bhagavan said, I reside there. The core of my being is my awareness about me. My awareness about me, makes me who I am. That has these good qualities about compassion, charity, love.\n\nBut once I decide in there, when my God is invoked then I will have this good quality manifest.

So these verses are obviously very contemplative verses and not really intellectual verses, but contemplative verses. But going back to our understanding of what is real, what is unreal, what is transitory or temporary, and what is permanent.",
      "reflection": "These verses introduce the crucial distinction that gives this chapter its name. There are two Purushas in the world: the perishable (kshara) comprising all beings, and the imperishable (akshara) - the unchanging witness within. But beyond both stands the Supreme Person (Purushottama), the Paramatma who pervades the three worlds and sustains them. Consider this carefully in your own experience: your body-mind complex is clearly perishable - it changes moment to moment. But there is something in you that notices these changes, that remembers being young, that fears death - this is the imperishable self, still conditioned by its association with the perishable. The Purushottama is beyond even this duality.\n\nThe analogy of space helps illuminate this: room space is imperishable relative to the walls, floor, and ceiling that define it. But remove those boundaries, and \"room space\" as a concept disappears into the infinite space that was always there. Similarly, when conditioning is removed, your individual self (jivatma) is recognized as the universal Self (Paramatma). Krishna declares: \"Because I transcend the perishable and am higher than the imperishable, I am celebrated in the world and in the Vedas as Purushottama.\" Today, practice observing your experience through these three lenses: what is changing (kshara), what witnesses the change (akshara), and what makes both possible - the ever-present awareness that is neither limited nor unlimited, but simply IS."

      ],
      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 15, Purushottama yoga, yoga of the Supreme Purusha. We have heard these terms before in Bhagavad Gita and Vedanta, Purusha and Prakriti. We understood from this discussion that the Prakriti is the manifest. Anything that which I can see, touch, feel and vouch for its existence is Prakriti, including my thoughts, my ideas. Because other people may not be able to vouch for, I can vouch for it that they exist. Anything that exists in the realm of my perception, feeling in thoughts is a Prakriti.\n\nBut that which supports this Prakriti or awareness is the Purusha. I am aware of this Prakriti because I am alive. If I am not alive, this body cannot perceive whether it is day or night. So that conscious principle in me is a Purusha. That's what we understood. The Prakriti is changing every minute, every second.\n\nAt a micro level, my body. My body has been changing every minute. I may not realize it till I see my pictures from five years ago. One good thing about these pictures on a website, we never change it. So I have a picture which was taken in 2003 on my website and anywhere else. So when the people come in contact with you in person, they get shocked.\n\nNeil, you know, look a little different. Well, I never realized it. But other people who say it or when we see our picture, we realize this is constantly changing. What it was yesterday is not today. So that falls into the category of a perishable things and beings. This body is perishable.\n\nBut this body is supported by something which remains constant. This change I'm noticing in my body because something remains constant. That constant factor is gauging the change. I used to look like this. I used to have all dark hair, all my beard was dark. That one who notices the change remains constant.\n\nThat the support for this change. Change can only takes place if there is something constant. So in my life, I, the consciousness, I, the awareness is constant. So when we remember Our childhood memories we don't think that that was something a different person. I remember this happened to me I remember that I remain constant. Everything else about me keeps changing.\n\nSo at my micro level, there are two Purushas, two \"me.\" One is perishable, which is the body, mind and intellect. One is imperishable, which is the one who is aware of these changes -- the one who is afraid of death. Otherwise, why would I be afraid if there is not someone watching and saying, \"Looks like this body is going to go out\"? People ask me all the time now, \"Neil, what's your plan?\" I said, \"What do you mean, what's my plan?\" He said, \"We're talking about retirement.\" I said, \"I have no plan, because I feel the way I felt when I started NBG Architecture the very first day. I'm the same person.\" \"You're going to be qualified for Medicare in a couple of months, so I'm sure you have some plan.\" And at that time I started thinking, oh, is that so?\n\nStatistically, Indians don't really last longer than somewhere about the early 70s. That's 65 -- I probably have less than 10 years. If I have less than 10 years, I haven't even planned what I'm going to do. Because I never feel old. That \"I\" at my level is always imperishable.\n\nWe started out this chapter by saying that when I think about myself, it seems like my source is somewhere unknown up above, but my life is all here, spread all around. The same way, now I look at it: when Bhagavan talked about the nature of the Supreme Being, everything that you see, perceive and feel is nothing but my expression. Right now I'm only worried about me. I'm not worried about whether you're going to retire or she is going to retire or he's going to retire -- what am I going to do? I'm also not worried about whether you people will be around when I die. After I die, I'm only worried about what will happen to me. So at my level, Bhagavan said, in this Loka, Dvau Purushau -- there are two Purushas in this world.\n\nIn my world there are two Purushas. One which is perishable, that I see. Bhagavan said, nothing that you see is other than me. I only exist and pervade everywhere. Everything you see, touch, feel and perceive is nothing but my expression -- including the perception of my own body, mind and intellect, which is deteriorating. I can't remember even my employee who has just left me three days ago. \"She used to work here.\" Because the memory is not now as good as it used to be.\n\nSo I see this perishable me, which is also the Purusha. And I also see the imperishable one who doesn't think about retirement even now. Dvau Imau Purushau -- in this loka of mine, in this world of mine, there are two Purushas. One is perishable, one is imperishable. Does the world end here for me? Beyond these two, there is a supreme Purusha.\n\nRight now that supreme Purusha I really have no connection with. So therefore I'm only worried about this Purusha. The one I feel is imperishable. Whatever I feel is still as young as when I used to be a little child. Bhagawan said that beyond these two there is a Purusha which transcends both the imperishable and perishable. And the example which we have seen is this room space is imperishable.\n\nRoom, walls, floor and ceiling is perishable. We are doing some renovation next door. So we say I'll move this wall here and do this because that's perishable. But we know that the space itself is imperishable. In relationship to the wall, floor and ceiling, this space is imperishable. But if we remove this walls, floor and ceiling out of the equation, what happens to this imperishable space?\n\nIt's not even imperishable anymore. If there is no perishable things in this world, the word imperishable means nothing, right? Because it is imperishable compared to perishable thing. Long-lasting battery, short-lasting battery. Lifetime warranty -- but whose lifetime? The battery's life, or the manufacturer's life?\n\nOr that company's life? All of our contractors, we ask them we need 10 year warranty or 15 year warranty. 20 years warranty guy gladly give. 5 years from now you'll try to call him and say we have problem, we need you to. The phone number is out of service. So the lifetime warranty we get is not your lifetime, it's the lifetime of the company.\n\nAs long as companies, the warranty is good. But all these things are relative. But if you take the relationship out, what remains is absolute which you cannot really compare in this world. So this Purusha, one is perishable, this body one is imperishable. Which is conditioned by this body, mind and intellectual. But if you remove the conditioning, what remains is absolute Purusha which is neither perishable nor imperishable but ever existing.\n\nAnd that Bhagavan said is by nature. So he said Uttamahapuru Sahatu Annyaha Paramatma ITI Udahrutah. We heard the word Paramatma. What does paramatma means? My atma is imperishable compared to my self. The body, mind, intellect.\n\nBut if I don't have this body, mind, intellect, that atma is absolute. Therefore it is param Atma. Not in reference to this. Our idea is that imperishable. Bhagavad Gita said that I'm imperishable. Even if I die, I'll be nil bhatt somewhere.\n\nBhagavan said Paramatma, it will be part of the infinite. Therefore that supreme being which forms this being as me is a paramatma. Swamiji gives a very nice example. Even within a room space there is a pot space. The space in the coffee cup is room space. The space remains in the room.\n\nBut when I even remove the room, the whole room space becomes so. When we take these layers out of identification, this is my mind, this is my body, this is my intellectual. They have their own identity and then I have my identity. The I which is my mind, my body, my intellect. When you remove in this I, what remains is just an absolute self. My atma, not conditioned by my limitations is Paramatma.\n\nYour lokatriyam Avishya Bibhartya via Ishvaraha. That Paramatma is supporting the three worlds I live in my three worlds. Waking dream and deep sleep. My waking world is different. My dream world is different and my deep sleep world is different. I, the conditioned self is going through all these three experiences in my life.\n\nBut the condition self is supported by whom? This room space is bigger, smaller, depending on where I put the walls here. But supported by what? By the universal space. This is a part of that universal space. Yasmaat Aksharam Atito Aham Aksarat Apicho Uttamah.\n\nTherefore Bhagavan's Yasmat Aksharam Adith. This self is even beyond imperishable. This self in me is much greater than this perishable Me. That's what we take some solace in learning Bhagavad Gita that even if I die, I will not die. Bhagavan said, but that self is even beyond Aksharaha. Beyond this imperishableness.\n\nImperishable as we have seen is only reference to the perishable. So let's say my life is hundred years. But there are things here which are 5000 years old. Compared to me, that thing has existing forever. But this time frame, when we completely remove the scale from our mind, what remains is absolute existence. No past, no present, no future.\n\nSo Bhagavan said, Yasmat Aksharam Atitah -- beyond imperishable and perishable. I am even supreme beyond this perishable and imperishable. Atah Asmi Loke Cha Vede Cha Prathitah Purushottamah. We had been hearing this word Purushottama. What is that Purushottama? He said, because my real nature -- I the Lord, the Ishvara -- and I say Lordship is that which supports my existence. That is my Lord.\n\nThat's when we call King a Lord. Because my existence as the commoner is because of his grace. He allows me to do that. That's why he's the Lord. In this case my Lord is him. Because my existence is because of him.\n\nTherefore in this world I am called Purushottama in the Vedas. Purushottama is described in Vedas as the one which is beyond perishable and imperishable. And also the scholars and poets in this world has sung its glory as something beyond perishable and imperishable. And therefore Bhagavan said, I am called Purushottama. Therefore this chapter was called Purushottama Yoga. Yoga of Purushottama.\n\nRight now I am completely yoked with this perishable and imperishable Purusha. I am very aware this is perishable me. I also know this body is going to die. But I have complete identification with it. I also have some solace because I had been learning Bhagavad Gita for many, many, many years. That something within me is imperishable.\n\nBhagavan said, but I am Purushottama. I am beyond this perishable and imperishable. Therefore I am called Purushottama. My own self, when it drops its relationship with this body, mind and intellect, this world, this perception, this feeling, these thoughts -- it becomes Purushottama. Yo Mam Evam Asammudhah Janati Purushottamam -- who knows his self as Purushottama? One who is Asammudhah, one who is undeluded. We, whether we like it or not, are deluded -- fooled by the illusion that you are different from me and she is different from he.\n\nNo matter how hard we try, this conditioning is so complete that we will not be able to get out of it. R. Bhagavan said there is a state for a Gyani to go beyond this illusion or delusion that he sees all the time that his relationship is with the Purushottama and not with this Purusha. Sarva Vid Bhajati Maam Sarva Bhavena Bharata.",
      "reflection": "The chapter concludes with both a promise and a proclamation. \"Yo mam evam asammudho janati purushottamam\" - whoever knows Me thus, without delusion, as the Supreme Person, knows all there is to be known. This is not intellectual knowledge but direct recognition. The word \"asammudha\" (undeluded) is key - our usual state is one of delusion, convinced that we are separate individuals competing with other separate individuals. The sage who sees through this illusion recognizes that the same Purushottama that animates his being animates all beings. Such a person, says Krishna, worships Me with his whole being (sarva-bhavena). This is not partial devotion squeezed between other activities, but total orientation of life.\n\nVerse 20 calls this teaching \"guhyatamam shastram\" - the most secret of all scriptures. Why secret? Not because it is hidden, but because it can only be understood by a prepared mind. Krishna promises that one who truly understands this becomes wise (buddhiman) and has accomplished all that needs to be accomplished (kritakritya). Imagine that - nothing more to achieve, nothing more to become. This is the consummation of human life. Today, carry this question: What if my deepest identity is not the struggling person I take myself to be, but the Purushottama itself, temporarily playing the role of this individual? How would that change what I pursue, what I fear, and how I treat others who are equally expressions of that same Supreme Person?"

      "commentary": "We have completed chapter 15 and we'll be discussing chapter 16 now. And so far in Bhagavad Gita, we have seen in the first six chapters who we are as the limited beings. Then the next six chapters we have seen, what is the nature of of the Lord, the one, the Bhagavan which I'm seeking? In the last three chapters, which is chapter 13, 14 and 15, we had been seeing how to differentiate the two and how to go from one to the other, from manhood to godhood. So the first thing we have learned in chapter 13 is how to differentiate between the field and its knower. Because right now we have a confusion about what is field and what is knower.\n\nI, the knower, think the world is the field. Even your body, mind and intellect which you consider you, is actually part of the field. One that knows this field is the Knower. So you've seen the differentiation between the knower and the field. We also come to the conclusion in that chapter. The knower is only one.\n\nWhether it knows to you, knows through me, knows through him, knows through her, Knower is only one. The field has many expressions, which we call Prakriti. The variety of manifestations in the Prakriti creates individuality. The same knower, functioning through these different manifestations, creates the individuality we call ego. Each ego thinks he or she is the Knower, while the knower remains one. So now the question arises for a seeker who is sincere: if the Knower is one, why is my knowledge different from your knowledge, and your knowledge different from his knowledge?\n\nIn the last chapters we have seen the qualities of the Prakriti -- the 3 Gunas. The Prakriti has these three qualities: Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. Depending on the permutation and combination of these three gunas in that particular individual, and as the light of consciousness shines through that equipment, the result will be according to the nature of that equipment. So these three gunas create various perception of the reality. Reality Remaining the same, you see differently and I see it differently. Something which is quite obvious to you becomes soul intriguing for me. And something so intriguing to you becomes so obvious to me.\n\nThat's because of the nature of our equipment. So to reach that transcendental self which we have seen in chapter 15, the Purushottama -- we've seen there are three levels of recognizing the all-pervading self. The first level is the perishable one which we can identify as myself, yourself, this world, my children, your children, my family, your family. We see that as a perishable world -- they come into being and will go away. But because we have come to the conclusion that there is only one entity which exists, which is the omnipresent Lord, even these transitory manifestations are also nothing but his self.\n\nAnd therefore we call it the perishable Purusha, Kshara Brahman. Next, the Akshara -- the one who knows these changes are happening in me, in you, in him, in her -- is the imperishable self. So I know that my body is decaying, my mind is losing its grip, my intellect is fading. But the one who knows these changes are happening is the imperishable in me. Therefore we call it the conditioned imperishable self. This body is the outward expression, which is perishable.\n\nOne who knows this body is decaying is the imperishable self. But we learnt in the last chapter that the Supreme Being transcends both the perishable and imperishable. And therefore he is called Purushottama -- Supreme Purusha, Supreme Being. Because the qualifications of perishable and imperishable are invalid at that point. Knowledge is only in reference to ignorance. I can say my knowledge of the English language started when I was in fifth standard, because in reference to that knowledge, I was ignorant. Before my fifth standard, I was ignorant about English.\n\nBut if there is no ignorance ever, the knowledge has no meaning. Or if there is no knowledge to be known, the ignorance has no meaning. Ignorance about my own tail has no meaning because I don't have a tail. So when you remove the both perishable imperishable, what remains is the Supreme Being, the Purushottama. Having understood this intellectually, we have a difficulty grasping these ideas. So now the chapter 16 starts with the qualifications required to purify your mind and intellect to reach the level of clarity so that the knowledge of the supreme self shines through automatically.\n\nIt also talks about what is right now stopping this knowledge -- what are the impurities which are veiling this truth from me. My own self is not very evident to me right now. My own self, I'm seeing through my colored glasses of identification with my body, mind and intellect. I do recognize I exist. I do recognize that no one else has to come and convince me that I exist. But that existence I can only perceive in terms of my body, mind and intellect.\n\nJust as I know the space exists, and I can perceive this space as room space. But only as long as the walls, floor and ceilings are there can I perceive room space. You remove all objects from this world -- perception of space is very difficult. So right now I do recognize myself, but in the context of my body, mind and intellect. I want to transcend this relationship.\n\nHow do I transcend? By purifying my internal instrument -- Antahkarana, mind and intellect. Antahkarana Shuddhi, purity of mind and intellect. So in Vedanta, the whole of mankind is divided into three categories. People who are divine -- those who have developed the divine qualities of mind and intellect -- are called Devas. Those who have demonic qualities, which bring you down to this world and bind you to this world, are called Asuras. Then there are the completely ignorant, completely indifferent about what is good and bad, called Rakshasas. And the goal of Bhagavad Gita is to help everyone.\n\nSo the goal of Bhagavad Gita is just like our president said: \"I'm not only the president of the 51% who voted for me. I'm also the president of the 49% who did not vote for me. I'm the president of 100% of Americans. My goal as president is to help each and every American, whether they voted for me or not.\" So Bhagavad Gita is like that. See, normally we say Bhagavan will only help you if you pray to him.\n\nBhagavan will only help if you do good things. But Bhagavan says, my goal is to help all of you -- whether you are divine, you are Asura (demonic), or you are Rakshasa. Now, the completely ignorant ones -- there is no help readily available for them.\n\nThey have to go through the adversity of nature to destroy this mold in which their mind and intellect is right now imprisoned -- to break that mold so they can get out of it. So that's why we say about some criminal, we can understand why they did this. But then the law of society, the law of nature, or the law of some divine force will break their mold for them. There is no advice given in this chapter for them, but the rest of us either fall into demonic or divine qualities. This chapter gives us guidance.\n\nSo the purpose of this chapter is the topics we have already discussed before. We have indication in chapter seven and chapter nine about people who have the knowledge will understand this, but people with the deluded intellect will not understand that. Now we have a chance to elaborate on them and see what are the qualities I can introspect in myself which I need to cultivate more and one which I need to negate. So the chapter starts with Sri Bhagavan Oacha Bhagavan directly comes out and gives this knowledge without any introduction to it. Abhayam Sattva Sansuddhi Gnana Yoga, Vivasthidhi Dhanam Damasta Yagnascha Swadhyayavam. We have seen this in first three verses that 26 divine qualities are enumerated for you and I to use it as the litmus test.\n\nHow many of these do I have? Now, most of us write it off: well, these are for saintly people, not for me. However, if you carefully look at it, all of these are in you. You practice all 26 of them in your daily life at some level. But now it is our turn to look at these qualities. And what we have latently is our ability to cultivate them, so that they become my own personality.\n\nSo the first one I say is Abhayam -- fearlessness. Now we know where fear comes from. Out of ignorance -- when I am not comfortable about a situation, I am fearful. One time I took the Chamberlain exit. Somehow I thought I'm going towards VCU. I ended up on the other side.\n\nAnd as I drove further I started getting more and more nervous about how can I take a short turn. Why I never been to that neighborhood ever before. Getting lost in West End is no big deal. I get lost in West End sometime, try to take a shortcut and then can't find a way out of that neighborhood. But I'm comfortable because I know this neighborhood, other side of Chamberlain Avenue. I did not know, so I was fearful.\n\nFear comes from ignorance. Therefore when someone who doesn't look like me, doesn't talks like me, does not dress like me, I am fearful of him. So Bhagavan says Abhayam, the first quality to be developed is Abhayam. And Abhayam comes from that basic understanding that no matter what the outward expression of the thing or being is, it is Lord's expression. So how far that expression is from me, as far as I am from my own self, there is nothing to fear in this world. So Bhagawan said Abhayam is the first quality a seeker develops.\n\nWe have heard that Alexander, going back, wanted to take a saint with him and said, \"Well, you come with me. Are you not afraid of me? I can kill you!\" The saint replied, \"You can't take anything from me and you can't do anything to me. So I'm not afraid of you, no matter who you are.\" He had nothing to lose. If I have no fear of losing anything, nobody can make me afraid of him or her.\n\nSo Bhagavan said, Abhayam -- the first quality a seeker develops is fearlessness, and that comes naturally to me if I have purity of my mind and intellect. Sattva Samshuddhi -- purity of heart. As we had heard before, these qualities are obviously linked to each other. One cannot be developed without others being developed. Without the purity of heart, fearlessness does not come. If I don't have purity of heart, I'll always be fearful of others -- that they will take advantage of me.\n\nPeople are going to walk over me if I don't behave this way. They will misunderstand me. All this fear is actually my own inbuilt fear of how incomplete I am. The more I know I'm incomplete, the more fearful I become. The more fearful I become, the more arrogant I will become. Therefore we see that people who have achieved a lot become more and more humble.\n\nOne of my friends had an encounter with Amitabh Bachchan. A whole group of actors were stranded at a New Jersey airport. Amitabh Bachchan was one of them, and he was telling me -- now this is obviously what I heard from him -- he said all these guys are jumping up and down about why they were stuck. He said Bachchan was peacefully sitting on one side. They were saying, \"Well, put me in a five-star hotel\" and all that.\n\nBachchan ended up in my friend's motel in a comfort suite. And he said he was so happy and peaceful.",
      "reflection": "These opening verses present twenty-six divine qualities beginning with abhayam (fearlessness) and sattva-samshuddhi (purity of heart). Krishna teaches that fear arises from ignorance - when we do not understand a situation or person, we become fearful. True fearlessness emerges when we recognize that all beings, regardless of outward appearance, are expressions of the same divine presence. As the teaching illustrates, the more we know ourselves as unlimited, the less we have to lose, and the less we fear. Consider: What situations or people trigger fear in you? Can you trace that fear back to ignorance or unfamiliarity? Today, when fear arises, pause and remind yourself that nothing external can diminish your true Self.\n\nThe qualities listed here - ahimsa (non-injury), satya (truthfulness), daya (compassion), kshama (forgiveness), and others - are not exotic virtues reserved for saints. They already exist within you at some level; the work is to consciously cultivate them so they become your natural personality. Choose one quality from these verses to practice intentionally today. If you select arjavam (straightforwardness), notice moments when you are tempted to be indirect or manipulative, and choose honesty instead. If you select mardavam (gentleness), observe how you speak to those around you and soften your tone. Write down at the end of the day: How did practicing this quality change my interactions? What resistance did I encounter within myself?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 16, Daiva Asura Sampada Vibhaga Yoga -- Divisions of Divine and Devilish Estates. We are all hung up on \"estate\" these days, because the Republicans want the highest value of the estate you can pass on to your children without any taxes. That's because we consider this estate as something which I have acquired and accumulated. Something which is rightfully acquired becomes mine, and everything associated with it I consider to be my estate. Now this estate I want to preserve, because I want to pass it on to my children even after I die. Therefore, I don't want the government to take it away.\n\nBhagavad Gita says that the only estate you will take with you is the quality of your mind and intellect. We have seen in previous chapters and in Vedanta in general that death is only for the body. The mind and intellect remain intact, identifying as an individuality by their own conditioning. The only goal in life, scriptures tell us, is to uncondition myself from this conditioning, so that Mama Atma -- myself, which I consider \"me\" -- is without any conditioning and becomes the Paramatma, the supreme self. The only difference between myself and the supreme self right now is that myself is conditioned by these limitations -- my body, my mind, my intellect. The body, I know, has its own limitations.\n\nIt was born at a time T1 and will die at time T2. That I consider my death. What I do not know about is the nature of my mind and intellect -- when it was born, when will it die? Our scriptures tell us that the death of the body is not the death of the mind and intellect. And therefore, to uncondition this mind and intellect is the goal of my life.\n\nTherefore the scriptures say the only responsibility a seeker has is to purify his antahkarana. This Antahkarana Shuddhi is the goal of all the practices, all the learnings that we have. So this antahkarana is my mind and intellect. The nature of my mind and intellect will decide what kind of wealth I have accumulated over my existence as this mind and intellect. And this wealth is nothing but my experiences and my tendencies. So that the experiences are good and I have developed the good qualities. My experience was bad and I developed bad qualities that became my estate.\n\nSo the nature of this estate is now defined into two categories. First, that which brings me closer to my supreme self, the Paramatma. The qualities which take me closer to my unconditioned self are called divine estate. Second, the qualities which bind me to this world -- to these limitations and therefore to the sorrows and unhappiness associated with limitations -- are considered devilish estates. Divine is something which is beyond my conditioning.\n\nDevilish is something which is tying to my conditioning. So this chapter defines those two estates which I have. And all of us have some divine and some devilish estates. You know, just like viz. How about your portfolio? There are some good stocks in my portfolio.\n\nBut then there are some really, really bad ones. Same way my mind and intellect has some divine tendencies and some devilish tendencies. But therefore we have heard that the Mahabharata war is a war in my mind and intellect. Few good thoughts are fighting too many bad thoughts, but few good thoughts. If they are aligned with the self, the Paramatma, the Sri Krishna, then the war will be won between these good and bad tendencies in my heart. Now what can I do proactively is to introspect regularly and constantly and see what is the nature of my mind and intellect.\n\nAm I more on a divine side or am I on the devilish side? Am I gathering more divine qualities or am I gathering more devilish qualities? I will be only able to do that if I understand what is divine and what is devilish. Now it has nothing to do obviously with Hinduism or any particular scripture or any particular faith. These divine qualities are universal qualities no matter which faith I belong to or which scripture I study. Because this divine quality is Thou shall not kill non injury, compassion.\n\nAll that we have learned is nothing which I need to be taught. It is something that comes to me naturally. Even as cave people, human beings knew that something which I have gathered with my efforts, nobody should take away from me. And therefore a good person will not do the same to others. If I don't want somebody to take away from my efforts, I also shouldn't be taking away from somebody else's efforts. So that became one virtue for a good person.\n\nThen there are all the others which I don't want others to do to me. I don't want somebody to hurt me. I don't want somebody to kill Me, I don't want somebody to cheat me. So now my good virtues are. I will not cheat anybody. I will not kill anybody.\n\nI will not hurt anybody. One of the criteria of a good seeker is defined in Vedanta as: just as, even in my sleep, I can never think about hurting myself -- even when I am completely deluded, I can't think about hurting myself -- a true seeker, even while in his conscious state, will never think about hurting anybody else.\n\nSo the good virtues are nothing so sacred or exotic to us. Good virtues are universal -- accepted by all cultures, all faiths, and people of all caliber of intellectual levels. But we need to remind ourselves time and again so that we can introspect. So the first three verses which we had seen in chapter 16 define those 26 virtues which are divine.\n\nIn other words, if I develop those 26 in my internal instrument, mind and intellectual. I will get closer to my supreme self. My mind and intellect's true nature is pristine. That it has an ability to see the reality as is. It is what I have acquired and superimposed on it as my estates have clouded that ability. Therefore, we consider the little children are divine.\n\nLittle children are the reflection of God, because they see reality as it is. They don't really have biases. I never had a chance to see a little baby growing, because as I told you, I have only one son, and for up to three years I didn't even know how he was growing up -- he was with my in-laws.\n\nBut now my granddaughter has given me a chance to see that how a little baby grows from time of her birth to where she is right now, 15 months old. And I could say that gradually she's developing personality. She's developing likes and dislikes. Things which she consider is good for her and things not good for her. Previous to this, her stage is 15 months. She was completely oblivious about.\n\nShe knows what is good and what is bad, and that's about it. So our mind and intellect, its very nature, is pristine -- it can see through to the reality as it is. But this coloring of my likes and dislikes, which I have acquired, has created this veil or tint on it. So now I'm seeing this world through my tinted glass.\n\nSo which tint is good and which tint is not good -- that is what we had been discussing. The first 26 virtues which we have seen are universal virtues which, once developed, will purify the mind and intellect, bringing them to their own pristine nature. So I can see the reality of myself as it is. I start seeing that this Self is nothing\n\nBut the Paramatma is the supreme self, just conditioned by my own limitations. Then the next three verses talks about which qualities which are really binding me to these limitations. So the verse four says Dhambah, Darpah, Abhimanaha, Chakrodah, Parushyam. You assume the good virtues. Now what are the vices? What are the bad qualities I can develop by my likes and dislikes which can be harmful?\n\nFirst is Dhambha hypocrisy to some respect. If you really introspect, we all do some kind of a Dhamba, something which I am not. I am trying to show enhancing your resume, Neil, is absolutely necessary in this world. You have to say how great you are. You fake it till you make it. So when I came to this country, I obviously came from Africa and in somewhat of a trained by British system where an architect cannot write his name larger than 2 inches anywhere in the world.\n\nSo our sign boards cannot have the names more than 2 inches tall. You cannot market, you cannot go and advertise. People are supposed to come to me for design and I'm not supposed to go to them. So I was in Houston, I obviously did not have a job. And one of the person who had a contracting company, he was trying to help me. So he gave me a little project, tiny little project.\n\nHe said, but Neil, we need a building permit and you don't know the system here, so I'll come with you to the Houston City hall and help you out. So we were standing in a line for the building permit application, and just before me is a Hispanic lady who wanted to extend her house. She was asking this guy and said, but I want a building permit to add this bedroom to my house. And the guy said, do you have plans? No, I don't have plans. Do you have an architect?\n\nWell, you need to get the plans drawn so that we can give you a building permit. My friend standing next to me said, neil, tell her that you're an architect. Neil, tell her that you're an architect. You can draw that plan for her. And I tell her, but how can I do that? She doesn't know me unless somebody introduce her to me.\n\nI can go and tell her that I'm an architect, that's okay. And he'll just go and give you a card. I don't have a card, you know, and he got so mad at me. You're never going to make it in this country. He said, this country, you need to walk as if you're the only architect ever walked on this earth there is nobody as great as you are. That was my first lesson in American marketing.\n\nNow we would consider a Dhamba. I know in my heart there are a lot of good architects. Much better than I am. At least I know where I am. But if I make that as my obsession to show the people it becomes a negative quality. First devilish quality.\n\nIs Dhambha showing something other than who I am. Nobody as good as I am. That's an arrogance which is obviously over estimation of my own capabilities or evaluation of myself. Then nobody can cheat me. And that's the guy who gets cheated very easily. I kept telling him this is not right for you.\n\nAnd he kept saying oh no, no. I've done so many businesses. I keep telling you you're going to get hurt on this project if you don't listen to me. He certainly was the easiest target to get hurt by others. Abhimanaha, these are the qualities even though I consider the helpful to me are actually most hurtful to me. Even when we are watching television or a movie only characters we like in them are one.\n\nWho are the nice guys? We don't like the villains. All the people who are very arrogant and pompous. So how can we like in real life if we are like that? How can we expect other people? And in the end, in all the movies and television who get hurt, those villains get hurt.",
      "reflection": "Verse 4 names six demonic qualities: dambha (hypocrisy), darpa (arrogance), abhimana (self-conceit), krodha (anger), parushyam (harshness), and ajnana (ignorance). Notice how these qualities are interconnected - when I feel incomplete within myself, I become arrogant to compensate; when I project something I am not, I live in hypocrisy; when my inflated self-image is challenged, I respond with anger and harshness. The teaching reminds us that the person who has achieved much often becomes more humble, while the one who feels lacking becomes more defensive. Today, honestly examine: Where do I project qualities I do not actually possess? Where does my self-conceit create friction with others? When someone questions my competence, how do I react?\n\nKrishna offers Arjuna reassurance in verse 5: \"Do not grieve, O Pandava, you are born with divine qualities.\" This same assurance extends to anyone sincerely engaged in self-inquiry. The very fact that you are studying these teachings, examining your own nature, and seeking liberation indicates the presence of divine tendencies within you. Yet verse 6 reminds us that both divine and demonic qualities exist in varying degrees within everyone. Rather than labeling yourself or others as wholly good or bad, use this teaching as a mirror. Ask yourself each evening: Did my actions today move me toward liberation (freedom from limitation and sorrow) or toward bondage (deeper identification with my limited ego)? Keep a simple tally and watch the pattern over a week."

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 16, Deva Asura Sampat Vibhag Yoga, Yoga of Divine and Devilish Estates. So as per some of the commentators, this chapter from 16 onwards, except 16, 17, 18 are elaboration on the ideas which are already discussed in Bhagavad Gita previously. But now we are elaborating on those ideas so that we can understand and apply in our daily life. The idea which we have seen earlier in the Bhagavad Gita is that the soul is divine, your self is divine. But the imposition on the self by all the layers which you have acquired through interactions with the Prakriti is hiding that self from you. I can't recognize myself right now because of all the layering on this pristine self.\n\nSo we have talked about who I, the individual, am. We talked about who the pristine self is. Now we are talking about what created this layering. In chapter 15 we talked about the Supreme Purusha. The Purushottama is beyond perishable and imperishable. This body is perishable.\n\nThe self is imperishable. The equipment which I have to transact with this world, this body, this mind, this intellectual are perishable. But the one who is supporting this equipment using this equipment is imperishable. Then Bhagawan said that I am even higher than them both the conditioned self in me which I consider my soul, my self is imperishable and perishable self that I condition myself, my body, my intellect are the two perishable me and imperishable me. Beyond this is the Supreme Me which transcends both Me the perishable and Me the imperishable. Those are the ideas we have seen in chapter 15.\n\nAnd then in chapter 15 we also learned how that all pervading, imperishable became an individual soul. It's a portion of mine which is as eternal as my real self. When associated with this world of Prakriti then acquires five senses in mind then it enjoys the world of objects through those five senses and then gathering those experiences it creates its own personality. Now, while interacting with this Prakriti, I gain both types of experiences -- experiences which are conducive and experiences which are non-conducive. The tendencies which I acquire become my wealth. So when we say \"my wealth\" in our day-to-day life, it is all that I earned and acquired.\n\nNow that has become my estate, it's my portfolio. So this chapter says I as the individual going through the variety of experiences from the day my soul started as an individual till today has acquired lots of impressions and built its own personality which has become my wealth, my estate. That estate has divine qualities but also some devilish qualities. And as these verses now will describe, what are the differences between the two? So the chapter opens with the first three verses which defines all the divine qualities or 26 qualities we have seen in first three verses. These are similar to the verses we have seen before where the Kshetra Gna was described by 20 qualities.\n\nKshetra was defined very elaborately in that chapter where Kshatragna was just given the qualities Amanittam oddam bitvam ahinsaakshantihi arjavam acharya upasana. Because the divine can only be expressed through its own expressions. Outside my physical appearance can be described by my mind, can only be read through my actions. Expressions of my mind, through my speech, my actions. So the divine is defined only by its expressions. And expressions we have seen in Kshatragna the Amani tum vadu.\n\nTheir similar qualities are here now described as divine qualities of a being, a person. The my estate then rest of the chapter now focuses on the devilish qualities or demoniac qualities. The reason for that is for us to know that the unique thing about ourselves is: it's very easy for me to detect divine qualities in me. Also, it is very easy for me to detect devilish qualities in others. My own devilish qualities I'm either completely unaware of, or even if I'm aware of them, I have justification for them.\n\nBut my divine qualities I'm very aware of and I can detect very easily. Well, I'm a very honest person. I'm a straightforward person. All that I others see me other way around. So you ask Meena, my opinion about myself is very different than my opinion about myself. We constantly see the demonic qualities in other but divine qualities in us.\n\nOn the other hand, when I have to judge myself -- am I a divine being or a demonic being? -- I'll always say, maybe, I'm not sure, I'm not divine. So we are completely confused about what our real nature is all about. So now Bhagavan clearly defines these qualities. Divine, as we said, is very easy to identify. But demonic is difficult when it comes to me.\n\nIt's very easy for me to say that's not a good quality in others. But the same behavior when I do, I will have a justification for it. So Bhagavan now goes into elaboration of why these qualities should be detected within yourself, how to detect them, and then how to avoid them. Verse 4 gave us in brief the devilish qualities. He said: Dambhah Darpah Abhimanah Cha Krodhah Parushyam Eva Cha Agnanam Cha Abhijatasya Partha Sampadam Asurim. These qualities are born out of your Asuric Sampat.\n\nWhat you have acquired is not your real nature. This Sampat is not your real nature. So as most of us at my age say, \"We came from India with $8 in our pocket. Everything I have here, I acquired from the United States by working here.\" So we were born with pristine nature, the self without any quality. And we acquired all these qualities -- of what?\n\nSo, Dambha -- hypocrisy; Darpa -- arrogance. Now there are subtle differences between them, even though we feel they all basically fall into the same behavior pattern. Dambha, hypocrisy: something which I am not, but I'm projecting. I'm not a very religious person, but outwardly I try to come across as a religious person. Darpa -- arrogance, I don't care. Abhimana -- self-conceit, a greater opinion about oneself.\n\nAbhimana. Krodha -- anger. Then Parushyam -- harshness, whether physical harshness or mental harshness. Agnanam -- ignorance. Bhagavan says, the more I associate with this world of materialistic Prakriti, the more I lose my identity with my true self. Agnanam -- they are Abhijatasya Partha Sampadam Asurim. They are born out of your devilish estate.\n\nThe qualities which you acquire from this world by attaching yourself to the materialistic values. So in simple obviously it is defined as divine qualities are one which are spiritual and devilish quality ones which are materialistic. So Swamiji explained that the whole humankind can be divided into two those who are more divine and those who are more demonic. And then he also goes into the third kind called Raksasis. Now obviously Sid is here so you have to be careful in defining this in historical terms. But Asuras and Raxasas were probably tribes at one point of time or Asura is actually one of the gods.\n\nThen there was a split. So people who followed Asura went to Iran, and those who remained stayed here. But as far as the ideas here: there are people who have more divine qualities or predominant sattvic qualities, who are closer to their real self. Those with more materialistic tendencies, who give more emphasis to enjoying the material pleasures, they are called Asuras. And Rakshasas are considered those who are completely ignorant about either. They are at the animalistic level, left on the lap of Mother Nature.\n\nThey don't have self efforts to improve themselves. So Bhagawan said here that these are the qualities which are considered demonic. Dhamba, Darpa, Abhimana, Krodha, Parushyam and Agnanam. And then rest of the chapter elaborates on the behavior and the verse 5 says Devi Sampadvi Mokshaya. Why should I be focusing on the divine? Because it will liberate you from your bondage.\n\nBondage with the identification with your limited self. Right now I consider myself to be the limited being. The limitedness is creating all the sorrows in my life. I'm not powerful enough, I'm not tall enough, I'm not strong enough. All those things which is stopping me to enjoy the unbroken happiness is because of my bondage to this limitedness. Once it is Devi Sampath Vimokshaya is for liberating you from your bondage.\n\nNibandhaya Asuri Mata Asuri is considered to be binding you to this limitedness. Masuchaha Sampadam daibim Abhijato Asi Bandava. But O Pandav, you don't worry, O Arjuna, don't worry. You are born with divine qualities. And last time we had discussion about whether Bhagavan said that because you are a royal prince. It does not say anything about royal prince here.\n\nIt simply says you are born with divine qualities. Bhagavan just assured him that just the behavior you have exhibited in your life. I assure you that you are born in divine qualities. As Swamiji says that we all can be assured that we have divine qualities. The very fact that on a Sunday morning you are learning Bhagavad Gita because of the divine quality. Giving assurance to seekers that if you are sincere about Liberating yourself, you need to have some courage.\n\nAs I said, we have easy detection of a divine quality. But when it comes to our judgment, we are not sure whether we are divine or not. So here is an assurance that because you are exhibiting divine qualities that you are divine. So the Master Chaha, do not worry. I look back on my life and I see a lot of mistakes I made and now I am worried about whether this is my exhibition of my devilish qualities. The very fact that you're interested in liberating yourself tells you that you are exhibiting the divine quality.\n\nContinue in a path of your journey for seeking your liberation. Now start making statements. Dvav Bhuta Sargo Loki Asmin Deva Asura Evacha Devo Vistarasahaprakhtaha Asuram Partha Meshrunaho. There are two types of beings in this world, Divine and demonic. Divine we have talked about at length in the previous chapters in Bhagavad Gita we have been talking about these divine qualities of the Supreme Being manifesting through all beings. We have been describing in detail.\n\nBhagawan said, so now I'll just focus on Asuri. I'm going to tell you Asuri in detail now. So rest of the chapter now focus on the behavior of Asuri. Prakriti Pravritimcha Nivruttimcha Janana Vidhu Asuraha. Very first manifestation of demonic qualities. I do not know what should be done and what should not be done, what is the right thing to do, what is not right thing to do, what I should be engaging into and what I should refrain from, what I should stay away from if I can decide that Bhagavan said, this is the first quality of your demonic estate.\n\nNo Saucam, there is no purity. Purity at the physical level, mental level, intellectual. Now Socham na cha API acharaha na satyam tesu vidyate. Those people with demonic qualities, they do not know what to do, what not to do. They neither have purity nor right conduct. They do not know the truth.\n\nAll these things are the manifestation of demonic qualities. So now we can start looking at ourselves and say, is that something I should be detecting in myself and correcting? And with that, I'll stop here because the rest is a continuation of this discussion. We are discussing chapter 16, Deva Asura Sampath Vibhaga Yoga -- Yoga of Divine and Devilish Qualities, or Estate, or Wealth. We have started learning Bhagavad Gita from Lord Krishna, where he first gave us this scenario of Arjuna -- that Arjuna is a broken-down hero, a person who has all the strength, all the valor, all the training to fight his situations.",
      "reflection": "Verse 7 identifies the first sign of demonic tendency: not knowing pravritti (what to engage in) and nivritti (what to refrain from). This confusion about right action was precisely Arjuna's condition in Chapter 1. The teaching clarifies that such confusion is not a personal failing but the natural result of an impure mind - one lacking saucha (cleanliness), achara (right conduct), and satya (truth). When you find yourself unable to decide what is right, recognize this as a signal to purify your inner instrument through study, reflection, and disciplined practice. Ask yourself today: In what areas of my life am I genuinely confused about right action? What impurities - desires, fears, attachments - might be clouding my discrimination?\n\nVerses 8-9 describe those who believe the universe has no underlying truth (asatya), no foundation (apratishtha), and no governing intelligence (anishvara) - that everything arose by chance from the union of opposites. Krishna calls such people alpa-buddhayah (of small intellect) and ugra-karmanah (of fierce actions). This is not condemnation but diagnosis: when I see no sacred purpose in existence, I treat life - mine and others' - as expendable. Notice how your worldview shapes your behavior. When you act as if only material success matters, what becomes of your compassion, patience, and honesty? Today, consciously affirm: \"There is a deeper order to existence. My actions have consequences beyond what I can immediately see.\" Observe how this shift in perspective changes your choices, even in small matters."

      "commentary": "We are discussing chapter 16, Deva Asura Sampath Vibhaga Yoga -- Yoga of Divine and Devilish Qualities, or Estate, or Wealth. We have started learning Bhagavad Gita from Lord Krishna, where he first gave us this scenario of Arjuna -- a broken-down hero, a person who has all the strength, all the valor, all the training to fight his situations. But under the burden of the circumstances, he broke down and did not know what to do and what not to do. So Bhagavan told him that the only cure for your condition is to correct your understanding about what is right and what is wrong, what is permanent and what is impermanent. Since the second chapter, it clearly says that your mistake is that you are identifying with your limited self and looking at all the other people through their limited equipment.\n\nBut they are imperishable when it comes to the soul. Their real being is imperishable, just as yours. So that was the correction Bhagavan wanted Arjuna to make the identification from this limited to unlimited. In Bhagavad Gita, the journey is to change your identification from the limited being that I think I am to the unlimited soul that I actually am. Everything we have discussed so far in Bhagavad Gita is towards that goal -- changing my identification from the limited self to the unlimited self.\n\nSo entire Bhagavad Gita up to chapter 15 has described that unlimited self and how to identify with that. And in chapter 16 now we are discussing what is that which is binding me to their limited self. So as we have discussed, the first three verses told us about the qualities of the divine being or the divine estate. As we transact in this world, we are going to acquire wealth, we also accumulate other wealth. Respect, recognition, appreciation, and on the other side, disgust, criticism, all that also we accumulate along with accumulating the wealth which is generally our normal endeavor in life. So these become our estate.\n\nSome are divine and some are devilish. Something which are acquired is pure and something we are called impure. So Bhagavan gave us the first 26 qualities of the divine estate. And then in the fourth verse he gave another six qualities of the devilish estate. So he said, the divine is quite obvious. Most of us recognize divinity when we see it.\n\nAnd as we have discussed last time, it is easier for us to find divinity in us. For my mind to detect good quality in me is easy, very difficult for my mind to detect the negative tendencies in me, but it is very easy for my mind to see negative tendencies in others. That person is very hypocritical. Well, he is doing it for ego only. We can very clearly recognize it, but it is very difficult for us to recognize in ourselves. So this chapter takes upon itself to describe in detail what would be the behavior of a person who is predominated by negative tendencies, which in this case we call asuric tendencies.\n\nSo when we see this behavior in others, it is easier to detect. But when I do something similar, I consider that as well very, very minor or well, this is the way the life works. If I don't do it, then people will trample over me, I'll be a doormat. So my behavior I can justify saying that's how you survive in this world. But Bhagavan makes it very clear that if you detect this type of behavior, this behavior is very negative for your evolution, for your goal of liberation. So he said there are two types of one helps you to liberate yourself from the limitation.\n\nOther will be binding you to this limitation. The more you try to satisfy your desires to get happiness through material goals, the more you will be binding yourself to these limitations. Pravrittim nivrittim cha janah na viduh asurah. The first indication is that the person does not know what to get engaged in and what to stay away from. I do not know what to do and what not to do -- which is what Arjuna's situation was in the very first chapter.\n\nHe did not know what is right for him. Bhagawan is not saying the Arjuna is asura, but the behavior he exhibited was clearly of asuric tendency. So something in him which was not allowing him to decide what is right and what is wrong. But once I know that that's a negative tendency Pravrittimcha nivruttimcha janahanna vidhu asuraha those who have the predominant qualities, they will not know what to do, what not to do. Na saucam, na apiyacharah na satyam teshu vidyate they will not have purity, cleanliness also na satyam teshu vidyate. They will not be able to tell the truth.\n\nAnd Swamiji explains here that it is not to put them down that Bhagavan is saying this. It's actually somewhat of a pity for them that they're incapable of doing so. They're incapable of living an honest life, incapable of telling the truth. Because they're so afraid that telling truth will put them in trouble. In our daily life we call it white lie. Because you know, telling truth is going to put me in trouble.\n\nWell, you really don't want to say what you really think about. They will say generally around looks good. So that basically is my incapacity to tell the truth. These people, when look at overall life, they are just not capable of telling truth because of their desire to protect what they consider is giving them happiness. And then he continues. Asatyam a pratishtam te jagat ahuhu Anishwaram.\n\nThis statement relates to what we have learned so far in Bhagavad Gita. In Bhagavad Gita we have learned that the nature of the self is Sat chit in Ananda that Sat is ever existing. We also learned that Sat truth is something which is consistent in all three periods of time. In the past, in the present and future. Something which was true in past has to be true today and will also be true tomorrow. So that is considered Sathya.\n\nBut that which is not consistent, something which was true yesterday, which is not true today. At some point it was true. Everybody agreed with each other. Other will all fall down at the edge of the earth. But now we know that that's not true. So that was not true.\n\nNow what we know was true then even though we did not know it. It is true today and will remain true tomorrow. The people with asuric tendencies, they think that this world is asat. In a sense it is impermanent. It came in existence by chance and will perish. That means it's not permanent or pratish.\n\nIt just by chance occurring. It happened Te jagat ahuhu an ishwaram. And there is no controller. There is no central authority who govern the laws of nature. Their view is it all came about by an accident. Will remain in this situation for a while and will disappear.\n\nThere is no basis for this world to exist. There is no fundamental substratum which supports this universe. Universe came in Existence by accident will get destroyed by accident, basically. Or pratishtham te jagat ahu Anishwam. This is the worldview, Swami is a materialistic view. When I try to analyze the truth in this nature through pure physical science, only then obviously the only thing I can find is these two came together by some accident.\n\nThese elements came together by accident and then it happened this. Then other things happened by accident and then this happened this. So starting from the Big Bang, we can say Big Bang occurred. Why it occurred we don't know. But it's an accident. It occurred and after that it started expanding and then hydrogen became helium.\n\nAnd all this is just an accident without any basis. Anishwaram There is no controller who is controlling the laws of nature. Aparaha paraha sambhutam. By coming together two opposites. Kim annyat kaama haithu kam. So the progeny or the continuing of this life on this planet came out by just accident.\n\nBy coming two together and for the only purpose fulfilling desire. There was no master plan, there is no underlying truth, there is no substratum. But it just all chance occurring. This is the view of the materialistic atheistic people. They have no faith in any underlying reality for this world. Etam drastim avastabya nastaatmanaha alpa buddhayaha.\n\nObviously this is a direct criticism from the Gitacharya that these people are wrong. They are seeing this from a very narrow perspective because they are viewing this world from a very narrow perspective. So when I see my life as a living being and I just analyze from a chemical perspective, electrical perspective, this is just a pure machine. It came together and it is pumping blood through the pumping action. And I can define everything in a mechanical term, in a physical term, in a chemical term, and say this is me. But what is it that keeping all the systems together, I really don't have an answer.\n\nSimply saying it's just all working together. Physics came together, science came together. So basically you can see this life either as something divine which is supporting it, or simply say this is all just chance occurring. There is a book I have read called Brief History of Almost Everything. It's a fantastic book. It explains right from the Big Bang to where we are today in a very succinct manner.\n\nHis conclusion is that we as human beings existing on this planet is almost a chance. That one in a million odds that happen thing and it happened and continue happening and we are still existing. But anything could have gone wrong and we wouldn't have been here. So basically you're saying that maybe just a chance that we have become who we are. So here Bhagavan is saying that these people are looking at the world from a material perspective, analyzing what's happening from a material perspective. They're coming to the conclusion it's just chance occurring.\n\nWhy I am not tall enough and other guy 7ft tall is just a chance occurring. So Bhagavan said that having such view Nast Atmanah they are destroying their own self because they are negating their own self. They are not even recognizing that there is underlying reality. Called myself Alpa Buddhaya. They have intellect they are obviously analyzing. They are using all the faculties to understand this world.\n\nBut from a very narrow perspective. Alpam Buddha Fools it basically says very narrow perspective. Prabhavanti Ugrakarmanah Shayaya Jagato Ahitah. So the actions are very harsh because they are not recognizing the underlying unity of our things and being. You can take example of vegetarianism. The one underlying theme of vegetarianism is that every life has right to survive and live.\n\nSo you have to inflict as little harm to a life to support yourself. But if I don't have that view, then obviously killing other animals may be justified. So Bhagawan said that because they have a narrow perspective, their actions are harsh. Shaya Jagato Ahithaha because of the misunderstanding of how this universe work, they are the enemies of the world for its destruction. You can relate to our green movement about saving the planet. Now obviously there are a lot of people coming out saying all this thing is a hoax.\n\nWe really don't need to preserve anything. This planet will preserve itself. In fact, I just read that somebody written a book that actually the global warming will be very good for farming. There are more warmer weather and it will make people rich. So you can look at it from any perspective and your perspective will decide how you're going to act in this world.",
      "reflection": "Verse 10 describes those driven by dushpuram kamam - insatiable desires. The key word is \"insatiable.\" A natural desire (I am thirsty, I drink water) is fulfilled and ends. But obsessive craving (I must have more, bigger, better) can never be satisfied because it arises from an inner emptiness that no external object can fill. The verse also mentions asuchi-vratah - impure resolves, actions taken without consideration of their ethical consequences. Examine your desires today: Which are simple needs that can be met and released? Which are obsessions that keep growing regardless of what you acquire? Choose one insatiable desire and ask: What inner lack am I trying to fill with this external pursuit?\n\nVerses 11-12 paint a vivid picture: those bound by hundreds of ropes of hope (asha-pasha-shataih baddhah), slaves to desire and anger (kama-krodha-parayanah), accumulating wealth through unjust means (anyayena artha-sanchayan). Notice the progression - endless hoping leads to attachment, attachment to frustration, frustration to unethical action. The teaching uses the powerful image of being \"bound by hundreds of ropes.\" Each unfulfilled desire is another rope. Each resentment is another knot. Today, identify one \"rope\" that binds you - perhaps an expectation about how someone should treat you, or an attachment to a particular outcome. Practice releasing it, not through suppression but through understanding: \"This hope is creating my bondage. I can act appropriately without being imprisoned by the result.\""

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 16, Deva Asura Sampada Vibhaga Yoga, Yoga of divine and devilish qualities. And we have seen that these are the qualities of my mind. Even though it seems like it is describing two sets of different people, one are divine and one are devilish. And as if we are dividing this world again into divine and devilish. The purpose of these qualities to be described in Bhagavad Gita is to understand our own mind. Our own mind has this both qualities, the divine and devilish, depending on which one we promote, either we'll be liberated or will be bound more and more into this world of limitations.\n\nSo the last verse we had seen last time says Asa Pasas Satayi Baddhaha, the person who is not knowledgeable enough about what will liberate him and what will bind him by depending on this notion that the sense enjoyment is the only purpose of life. By hook or crook, I should achieve what I want. They will be more and more bound by unlimited desire, Asha Pasa, bound by this bondage of desires. You know, satay, that means innumerable desires. And therefore they will do anything which is either appropriate or inappropriate. They will try to achieve, acquire, hoard things which they think will give them the happiness by even illegal means.\n\nInappropriate means continuing in the same dialogue as we have seen, Bhagavan now describes what will be the tendency or the thinking of these people. Swamiji says there's not really much to elaborate on it. Just as we have seen that the first three verses which describe the divine quality, there is not really much to be discussed about. These are universal qualities. Even cavemen knew what is right and wrong. Somebody should not take the food which I have acquired with my labor.\n\nTherefore, if I do that to others, it will be wrong. I don't want somebody to kill me, and therefore killing somebody is bad. These are universal values which every human being from the dawn of the civilization know. In the same way, the tendencies and thinking of a devilish mind that we are going to be discussing also don't require much explanation. Why? Because we all have experienced this at some point or other, at some level or other. Except that at that time, I did not know that my thinking was going to create more unhappiness for me.\n\nWhen I was thinking about that, I was thinking I'm doing this to get more happiness, for financial security. I put more and more money into the stock market, and as it grows I get the statement every month -- it made 8%, then next month 10%. Feeling pretty good. Except when it collapsed. Didn't have the courage to open up your statement. But while I was doing that, I thought, I'll get this and then I'll also get this, and therefore I'll be completely secured. We didn't think it through -- we work all our lives so hard.\n\nI have not come across a single person who says, \"I really need to work hard in my life, but I'm enjoying it.\" Everybody thinks the same thing. What I was thinking all the time was: Idam Adya Maya Labdham -- I have gained this today. Today I can say I have this. I reconcile my statement of what my assets are at the end of the year, for taxes or whatever. \"Boy, that's pretty good.\" Or, \"Well, at least I have this.\"\n\nAnd then what is my next thought? Imam Prapsye Manoratham -- I have this, but I will also get this. What if the financial planner says, \"Okay, well you need to have this to retire at the age of such and such. This many times your current income -- you will need this, and therefore you need to do the following.\" So you start planning. The first time a financial planner, a friend of ours coming to Chinmaya Mission in Dallas --\n\nI was pretty young at the time. I was like 30 something. And he looked at them and said you need million something dollar to retire. I don't think I'll ever have a million dollar. At the time I was probably making like $35,000 a year and the guy was trying to tell me I need million dollar to retire. You forget about it, okay?\n\nI'm going to work till I die. No planning required. Because when you see that I have this, I need to achieve this or work hard. Neel, you have to have at least this much when you retire. I have this right now. This is a common thinking.\n\nNobody will label that as devilish. Bhagavan says that's the quality which binds you to this world of constant changes and disappoints you more times than you think it will. Idham asti idam API me bhavishyati punardhanam. And this wealth shall also be mine in the future. It's simple planning. I acquired this, and I'll work a little hard and do this project, then invest here, and then I'll get that.\n\nBhagavan says that may be okay for planning purposes, but when that becomes your obsession, then it has a sure capacity for failure. You should be planning. I can never forget this thing in my life. I bought my first house in Dallas, Texas in 1984, just before the election. I guess it was the Reagan second election. And they told me that after the election the prices will go so out of control that you won't be able to buy.\n\nSo you should buy before the election. Says, okay, you buy this house, $150,000 minimum, it will have 5% appreciation. You have compounded 5% for 10 years. The value of this thing will be this. Oh boy, that's pretty good. They say that's guaranteed 3 to 5%.\n\nIt may go up and it's guaranteed. I sold that house, the one which I bought in 1984, in 2000. Now you apply that formula, 150,000. Should have been at least $350,000, right? I sold it for $10,000 more than what I bought in 1984. And as if I have not learned the lesson yet, I bought a house in Northern Virginia where they say it was Dallas.\n\nYou know, that's an oil dependent economy. It goes down or it goes up. We are federal government dependent economy. Guaranteed 20% appreciation every year. You can look at it last five years and you will see it. I bought a house again in 1988, Northern Virginia, in Fairfax.\n\nAnd again I said, well, they say 20%. I'm going to be on 5%. Okay, at least I'm safe. I projected in about 10 years, eight years, five years. I bought it in 1988, sold it in 1996 for exactly $6,000 more than what I had bought for. I made $6,000 after eight years owning that house in Fairfax, Virginia.\n\nWe plan, but what will come out of my actions is not guaranteed. Bhagavan said, there's nothing wrong in planning. That's not in a devilish pursuit. What devilish pursuit is, if this doesn't happen by hook or crook, I will make somebody a Scapegoat and get my money. So therefore it says Idamasti Idham Apimi Bhavishati Punardhanam. This is mine and this will also be mine.\n\nThat which I have projected at a 5% appreciation that shall also be mine in 10 years. I can say this is what I have. This is its value today. What will happen 10 years from now only he knows. And whoever after 10 years has to buy this house knows. So it is the attitude of my mind makes the same thing either divine or devilish.\n\nI took care of this competition. Obviously in those days they were enemies and they were killing each other. But in a normal day to day even they say I never have killed anybody. So I never said I killed this person. But we do mentally all the time. I killed this competition.\n\nHe was trying to be the VP of the company. But I really manipulated. I went around and talked to all the other bosses and I really pushed him down. And now I got the promotion as vp. That's I who killed him for that purpose. So Asaomaya Hataha Satrahu who was my enemy who is in the path of my happiness.\n\nMy enemy is the one who is obstructing me to be united with my happiness. I killed this person, initiator Aparanape and the others who I think will be on my way, I will kill them too. It always gives me a kick. Anytime I read this Rasi Bhavishya we get this South Carolina Sati magazine and only thing I read is honestly the horoscope. Because I have nothing to do with all these businesses in South Carolina. Only thing I can relate to is that last page which says your monthly horoscope.\n\nAnd this guy constantly warns me. At least the Aries who I am, you know, born in that sign. Be careful about the people around you. They may be planning to harm you. Now what do you think? My thinking would be well look at Meena, Pourvi, Neeraj, little Medha.\n\nThey must be all planning something against me or my employees or my friends. This is just insecurity. We bank on people's insecurities. Because if you don't take these annuities the market may go down. You will have no security when you are retiring. You need a guaranteed income.\n\nAnnuities will give you this guaranteed income. He fails to tell you that those annuities cost lot more than any other investment you would do. They are making money in your insecurities. What will happen when I return If I don't have money they say okay we'll take care of it. But we'll take part of your money and put it in our pocket and make you feel good that you will have the guaranteed income. I took care of this computation, this enemy, even the others I'll take care of them too.\n\nTherefore I will be secured. When I'm doing this, my state of my mind is I am the Lord of my being. I take care of myself. Not only I take care of myself, I take care of all people around me. What would happen to them had I not been doing what I am doing. All these people are dependent on me.\n\nBhogihi and I'm enjoying it. All these efforts which I'm putting and gaining this I have got that I'll be getting. I'm the Lord of lord is on whom my existence is dependent on. So in the feudal system whether you live or die, the way you live is dependent on the Lord. He decides how much money there was no unions and nobody decides how much to give it to the workers. He decides whatever he has to give.\n\nSo therefore he's the Lord and you're the commoner. Ishwara Same he decides how this world is going to function. So when I decide that I am the Lord of my Sansar I decide in old Indian system the head of the house will tell how everyone should leave in that house. I think that I control everybody and everything. Bhogi and I'm enjoying the fruits of my actions. I'm a successful one.\n\nWhat you have accomplished in your profession and it's admirable and what you accomplished in your wealth and it's all admirable. Guy doesn't know the other side of the story. What I not accomplished and where I have failed. It is okay for others to think about that. When I start thinking about my own accomplishments that's where the problem starts. It's perfectly okay for us to admire the people who accomplished some great things such as Isaac Newton or Bill Gates or Steve Jobs.",
      "reflection": "These verses expose the inner monologue of the ego-driven mind: \"This I have gained today; tomorrow I will get more. This wealth is mine; more shall be mine soon. I have defeated this enemy; I will defeat others. I am the lord, the enjoyer, successful, powerful, happy. I am rich and well-born - who is equal to me?\" Read these statements slowly and notice which ones resonate uncomfortably with your own thought patterns. This is not about shame but honest recognition. When we reconcile our assets, review our accomplishments, or compare ourselves favorably to others, we are walking the edge of this mindset. The teaching does not condemn planning or achievement - it warns against the intoxication that comes when success inflates the ego rather than humbling it.\n\nVerse 15 reveals the final delusion: \"I will sacrifice, I will give, I will enjoy\" - even spiritual and charitable acts become corrupted when performed for ego-gratification. The person described here makes donations to see their name on plaques, performs rituals to impress others, and serves the community for recognition. Examine your own generous acts: Do you give anonymously, or do you need acknowledgment? Do you serve quietly, or do you need others to notice? Today, perform one act of kindness or generosity that no one will ever know about. Notice what resistance arises when your ego cannot claim credit. This practice reveals how deeply ajnana (ignorance) has penetrated even our noblest intentions."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 16, the Evasura Sampada Vibhaga Yoga. The divine and devilish qualities are the estates. This is the only estate you and I will carry with us when we die. All other estates will remain. But these qualities or tendencies of my mind, which are both as some divine tendencies and some devilish tendencies, I will carry that as my estates and I'll start from there. You've seen so far that this divine tendencies will liberate me from my limitations.\n\nThe veilings on my mind which is right now is not letting me see the reality as is that myself and the supreme self is one and the same. On the other hand, the devilish qualities or the aspheric tendencies which in reality all it means is it binds me to this manifest world and therefore I will be more covered with ignorance from my own self. And therefore it is very important for me to understand what are these qualities. So in the beginning we have learnt about all the divine qualities and they are universal as we have said. So therefore there is not really much explanation needed. I should treat others just as I would like others to treat me.\n\nSuch divine qualities in if I practice it will liberate me from my limitations. But more and more I get bound to this world of manifestation. This is me and this is the world. This I want and this I want to avoid. It binds me more and more to this world. And therefore it is very important to understand how this thing works.\n\nSo we have seen so far that asuric tendencies make people believe that there is nothing more to this world than enjoy the sense gratification or satisfying the desires that I have, the lust that I have, and who knows, because I cannot see what was before my birth and I cannot see what was after my birth. Well, let's just consider this life is the only life that I have. And therefore let's make the most out of this life by by hook or crook. So I have now come to the conclusion that hoarding more and more wealth will make me happy. I will achieve that by any means, any unjust means. Even though I know this is not right, I will go ahead and do it anyway.\n\nAnd once I get into that mode of mind, my situation would be that I will be constantly worried. Chintama Aparimayamcha AP I'll be overwhelmed by the worries. I'm always worried about things which I don't have. Once I acquire it, I'll be always worried about how to safeguard it. Because just as I took it away from somebody, somebody will take it away from me. So this mode of mind will be constantly be engulfed by these worries.\n\nBut then at the same token my ego will start rising into its power and start thinking look, I have acquired this. These are the natural tendencies of my ego. Once I accomplish something, I start thinking nobody else could have done it but I did. The last few verses which we have seen describe this mode of mind. Even success is something that is very difficult to digest or to become worthy of, because success can intoxicate you with wrong thoughts.\n\nInstead of getting you to a higher level by whatever you learned or achieved, it sometimes brings you down. And if you fall into that category, what happens is what we have seen in the last few verses, which basically says: Adhyah Abhijanavan Asmi -- \"I am rich.\" Once I have acquired wealth because I thought that's my security, that will give me happiness, I now forget why I acquired this wealth. It starts giving my ego a boost -- \"Look, I am rich.\" So now I'm associating myself with my riches.\n\nI start thinking I am my car, my car is me. I expand my identity not just to me as the body, mind and intellect, but now to all the possessions that I have. So my identity is incomplete without my possessions. Me minus my possessions is nothing. Now therefore I think: \"I am rich.\" Abhijanavan Asmi -- \"I am well-born.\" And Konyo Asti Sadrusho Maya -- \"Who is there who is like me?\"\n\nThese are the side effects of success. Success is something obviously very necessary for you to do what you need to do. But if that success only associate with why I wanted to achieve this then it's not really that big of a problem. But when I start associating with my ego then all these side effects will kick in. So now what I'm doing, even the thing which I'm doing good instead of giving me good results give me actually wrong results. So Yakshe Dashyami Modishya I am making the sacrifice.\n\nSacrifice is something you make so that you become more humble. But now I'm making sacrifice which makes me more arrogant. That look I am making sacrifice. Other people are not doing it. I am giving this donation. Donation is something is for you to get rid of more of your ego.\n\nBut it actually gives you boost your ego more that I am making donation. So the things which are supposed to be giving you the right results now start giving you the wrong results. Bhagavan said that this Asurik Sampath is. You need to be very careful in understanding that what are its evil effect on your mind and yourself. Once you are deluded. They get these wrong results even from the right actions.\n\nAnek Chitta Vibranta Mohajal Samavrataha. Why all these things happening to them? Because they are Anek Chitta Vibhranta. They are bewildered by many fancy. They have all different kinds of fancies about what they are going to achieve, what their capabilities are. And I can also do that.\n\nI tell all the time that if you are in one profession you always like to start thinking that something associated with it also I can do it. Most architects start getting into development and investment and real estate and all that. Because everybody comes to ask me how to do this. Why don't I do myself and also make money? In the end every architect who has tried has failed. Because that's not your really expertise or nature.\n\nYou're good at something -- that's why you became something. But this fancy of mine which says, \"I can do this, I can also do this. I have achieved this, I can also accomplish this.\" Moha Jala Samavritah.\n\nBecause they are entangled into the snare of Moha delusion. This moha is simply my mind just cannot see the value of things and being as they are. So I start associating more and more values where they don't belong. Including on my own self, my own abilities. So I'm completely entangled into it. Prasaktaha kama Bhageso.\n\nWe know how the addiction works. Once I get something, I want to get it again and again. My Starbucks example, first time I had the Starbucks coffee. It's not an addiction. The second time and a third time and after that, how can you live without it? Prasaktaha kama Bhagesha.\n\nOnce I start enjoying the sense gratification more and more I get addicted to it. Patanti Naraki Ashucha. These unclean minds, people with the unclean intentions, they fall into the Naraka hell. When things don't go right for us and we start worrying about it and start losing sleep over that. It's falling into hell. Other people may think you are doing very well but you ask yourself how you are doing.\n\n\"Are you enjoying, Neil?\" Because 18 things are going right in my life, but these two are not letting me enjoy those 18 things which are going right for me. So where am I living? Not in heaven, but in hell. From an outsider's perspective, I may be doing very well. Therefore you read these stories about people like the hedge fund manager.\n\nThere'd be billions, not even millions and still they are suffering through. He is under investigation, going to jail. If money was the only object which was going to make him happy, he wouldn't be living in this situation. Patanti Naraki Asuchao with that unclean intentions, pursuing the goals of satisfying their desires instead of giving them joy which they were seeking from those endeavors, they fall into this hell. Atma Sambhavitah Stabdaha. Now other people can see, but I think he's doing wrong.\n\nHe's going to get hurt by this thing. But I don't see myself. I'm suffering but I'm still continuing. In Gujarat there is a saying, a gambler who is losing, he puts double the stake. He thinks the next time I can make it up. And this is really true.\n\nStock market, forget about gambling. Stock market people put money, the stocks go down. He think, oh now this is the time to get in. He puts more money into it. There was a company I was designing a headquarter in Charlottesville called Value America. I don't know any of you remember, but 2000, it was a rising company.\n\nInternet bubble at the peak. And they hired me to design their headquarter in like June or July. And they had 600 people. And then they told me that by December we had thousand people. So they were designed with 1000 people. This building has to be completed by end of next year or so.\n\nWe are rushing to do that. And then just before the end of the year in December, I get a call and say, Neil, send your invoice as quickly as possible because tomorrow the company may not be there. So anyway, the company was in a stock market. And then by the time I got involved, 15. And then when they called me it was about like $4 and say, got to be this good. No matter how much $4 will at least put $4,000.\n\nI put thousand shares at $4, I said, I have seen that all the setup and those computers and all that is more than what they are saying. Well, the $4, then it eventually became 20 cents and eventually become zero. Even though I knew things are going down, I thought there's got to be a better deal. That's because we're atma Sambhavidah. We're overconfident about our own ability to think what reality is. Atma sambhavitah tab dhaha stubborn.\n\nEverybody else says, I understand this thing better than you. Sabdaha dhanamanam adhan vitaha. Filled with pride and intoxication by their own achievement. No matter what the other people see what I'm doing, which is dangerous, I don't say it myself. Yajante nama yagnehi te dambena Avidhi purvakam. I want to do right things.\n\nI have done this thing because I think this will help me doing right thing. But I got completely distracted by my ego. It has affected my Ahankar so much that now when I am doing the right thing, as I said the sacrifice, I'm doing it just in the name of it. It's not truly a sacrifice anymore. And I'm doing everything else. Giving a donation, showing off what I'm doing right for the community, services, all that.\n\nI'm doing it for the namesake only. \"If you don't put my name in this, I'm not interested. I will be making a donation as long as you make me a board member.\" So my thinking has now gone completely in the wrong direction. I understood before, when I didn't have all this wealth, that all these yajnas and daan and sacrifice and services are for my own good -- to purify my own self.\n\nBut with all this achievement of my wealth, I have started thinking other way around. And therefore now I'm doing all the things avidhi purvakam not in a right manner.",
      "reflection": "Verse 16 describes the state of being aneka-chitta-vibhrantah (bewildered by many fancies) and moha-jala-samavritah (entangled in the net of delusion). This is the scattered mind that chases multiple desires simultaneously, convinced that each new acquisition will finally bring fulfillment. The verse warns that such minds, addicted to sense pleasures (prasaktah kama-bhogashu), fall into naraka - not a place but a state of constant anxiety, dissatisfaction, and inner torment. Reflect honestly: How many \"fancies\" are you currently pursuing? How scattered is your mental energy? The teaching suggests that even worldly success, when pursued obsessively, becomes its own hell. Today, practice simplification: identify one desire you can release, one pursuit you can let go of, to reduce the chaos of competing wants.\n\nVerse 17 reveals how even sacred acts become corrupted: the wealthy and proud (dhana-mana-madanvitah) perform sacrifices in name only (nama-yajnaih), motivated by ostentation (dambhena) and without proper understanding (avidhi-purvakam). Verse 18 identifies those who, filled with ego, power, arrogance, lust, and anger, actually hate the divine presence within themselves and others (mam atma-para-deheshu pradvisantah). This hatred of the Self manifests as disregard for one's own conscience and dismissal of others' good intentions. Ask yourself: When has success made me more arrogant rather than more grateful? When have I ignored my inner voice because it conflicted with my desires? When have I dismissed good advice because it came from someone I felt superior to? These are the subtle ways we \"hate\" the divine within."

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 16, Deva Asurasampatvibhaga yoga. Yoga of Differentiation between the divine and Devilish Estates. These are the two types of qualities we have acquired in this world, going through the various experiences throughout our life. And when we look at it from our perspective, for many lives, we've been going through many different experiences. These experiences leave impressions on my mind. Those impressions create tendencies.\n\nThose tendencies which I have is my wealth. That's all I carry around from one life to another. All other wealth which I consider my wealth right now is temporary and I have to leave behind. But this wealth which my tendencies I carry with me. So that's my permanent wealth, my permanent portfolio. So Bhagavan said that in that portfolio you may have divine qualities or divine tendencies and also devilish tendencies.\n\nPut simply: positive tendencies and negative tendencies. Positive, as we always know, is helpful. Negative, as we always know, is harmful. So these divine tendencies which I have are liberating. Bhagavan said in the beginning of the chapter, these are liberating tendencies. These tendencies will lead me to act in a manner which will liberate me from my limitations.\n\nLimitations are the ones which are binding me to sorrows and unhappiness. If I were powerful enough to own every piece of real estate in this town, then obviously I won't be competing for buying a house in Twin Hickory because I own everything. But because I am never infinite, this limitedness creates competitions and failures, and that creates sorrows and unhappiness. So we're going to say that these divine tendencies which you have acquired through your experiences, which align you more with your own self, are liberating from this bondage -- the bondage of identification with this body, mind and intellect, this limited self which I have right now considered to be my true self. On the other hand, there is the devilish tendency.\n\nNow in this case, even though the word devilish or diabolical sounds too negative, but they are basically tendencies born out of my ignorance. What is the truth about my own Self. So I come to the conclusion that there is no higher self. There is no one to control anything. Whatever I can do, I am by myself. Whatever I need, I need to do to get happiness.\n\nThat type of belief will lead me to do things which are only for the sense gratification. These creates the negative tendencies and binds me more and more to this limited self. Bhagawan said these tendencies are binding which are in our normal term. We call it a materialistic view of the world and materialistic approach to life. That this material will give me happiness. The things which I acquire from this world, things which I accomplish in this world will make me happy is the materialistic viewpoint.\n\nThe spiritual viewpoint is: if I can be happy by myself, then I really don't need anything external to make me happy. Everything else may be just to fulfill my needs, but not wants. So the desire to sustain myself is not unhealthy. But when that desire becomes an obsession for something, then it becomes unhealthy. As we know, everything in moderation is good. Even obsession to not do something can become very dangerous sometimes.\n\nSo Bhagavan described these tendencies and said that these are the tendencies you should avoid. These are tendencies you should try to cultivate in yourself. And then he came to the last topic. He initially said that we have talked about divine qualities a lot. \"We'll talk about these devilish qualities in detail. That's what we need to pay attention to.\" As I said in the beginning, our mind has a tendency to only see the divine in us.\n\nDivine qualities in us. Devilish qualities in others. Very easy to see what other people are doing wrong. Very difficult to see what I am doing wrong. We always enhance our resumes. We ask somebody to do his own self evaluation in the end of the year.\n\nIf you see his self-evaluation, there is no negative in it, period. His supervisor will find negatives in it. It is very important that we develop the discipline to introspect and find what is not right within my own thinking and negate them. Bhagavan says, these tendencies -- you must know these devilish tendencies. When you detect them in you, remove them so that you can move forward in your life.\n\nYour goal is to be happy. These tendencies will never make you happy. Even though it may seem that they will make me happy, they eventually make you unhappy -- and therefore avoid them. So you have seen that Bhagavan described what an asuric person looks like: Ahankaram Balam Darpam Kamam Krodham Cha Samshritah.\n\nThey are full of ego, power, self-conceit, lust and anger. Now we all have all of that in some degree. But if all of them together are powerful, then you become an Asura. If all five of them are at full capacity, then you become an Asura. Mam Atma Para Deheshu Pradvisanto Abhyasuyakah -- they hate my presence in them and in others. In other words, they have no value for life.\n\nThey will have no value of life, of their own or others. They will have no value for any noble act or have no desire or to appreciate other people. So they have no knowledge about what is divine in them or their own conscience. They will suppress their own conscience when it is trying to guide them for a right actions. And they will also not recognize the good intentions of others around them when others are trying to help them. These people will hate me in their own body and also in the others.\n\nTan Aham Dvishatah Kruran Samsareshu Naradhaman Kshipami Ajasram Ashubhan. To these cruel doers, the lowest of men -- as I said, when you are qualified for this distinction, when all five of those qualities are fully developed in you, there is no room for any divine tendency. Then Bhagavan says, I send them to the lowest of the yonis. And we have discussed last time: it is not that Bhagavan is punishing.\n\nSo Bhagavan is not sitting there and punishing people. Because you are not doing this right, your own actions will lead you towards the lower and lower state of existence. Whatever the tendency you develop, that is the environment you will feel comfortable. My tendency is to come to Gita class. I will feel comfortable here and somebody may be comfortable doing something else. Because their tendencies.\n\nIf your tendency leads you down to this path of the Hankara, Balam, Darpam, Kamam Krudam, you will be born into the same environment again. If you consider this sense gratification is the only goal of life then obviously you will be only seeking that environment. And Bhagawan said, I, as the lawgiver and law enforcement forcer in this world put them into the lowest yoni again and again. Asurim Yonim Apanna Muda Janmani Janmani. Birth after birth, having born in the demonic wombs. Because that's the path I have chosen.\n\nWhatever path I take, I become good at that. So you start your career in engineering or architecture, medicine. You do the first project and the second project and in a short time you'll have a huge portfolio of work you do. And suddenly, whether you like it or not, you become an expert in that. And other people say, but you are only expert in this. We can give you work in this field because you only do this.\n\nThat's how we become all experts in something. Because we continue to do the same thing over and over again in the same line of work or same line of actions. So these people are now becoming expert in asuric existence. Ashram yuni mapanna by taking birth in Ashram yuni again and again. Mama aprapyevakantoya tatoyati Adhamam gatim. They continue their existing without attaining me, Attaining me.\n\nBy not recognizing their own self. They continue their existence from one life to another without recognizing what is divine in them, without recognizing the sanctity of life. And yantim adamam gatim. And they continue to go lower and lower and lower. Because that's the path they are pursuing, they are progressing into. Then he says, trivedam naraka sidham dwaram.\n\nSo up till now we have just discussed what the divine qualities are, what the devilish qualities are, who are divine, who are devilish. But what is the cause? This verse gives us the cause and also the prescription for how to avoid them. Trividham Narakasya Idam Dvaram Nashanam Atmanah. These three are the gates of hell, which are the destroyers of the self. Kamah, Krodhah, Tatha Lobhah -- lust, anger and greed.\n\nThese are the only three things which you have to avoid, Bhagawan. Now knowing this, we fall prey to these three. Because how the karma works is once you start thinking about some object. When you constantly think about any object, you develop attachment to it. Then you create a desire for that. If you don't get that object, you're a krodha.\n\nSo you created attachment. That attachment became lust. Lust in a sense, I ought to have it. Without that, life is not worth living. So that becomes a kamaha. A normal desire to buy a car is not a kamah because I need it for transportation.\n\nBut it becomes obsessed and I have to have BMW and then BMW, BMW, BMW. Then it's a problem if I don't get it. Because I said I can buy BMW in $50,000. And then by the time I accumulate 50,000, the car has gone to 60,000 or 70,000. It almost is slightly above my pay grade. And that will make me angry.\n\nSo Bhagawan said, that's the mechanism of lust. A normal desire is Innocent. I'm thirsty, I need water. I have a desire to drink water. I'll get up, get a glass of water and I'm done with it. But a constant obsession about something becomes karma.\n\nWhen that obsession is obstructed by this world for me to attain that I become angry. So that Krodha, we all learned in chapter two the anger. It shuts down my buddhi. Because we have this safety mechanism just like the breaker trips and electricity that to protect integrity of your mind and intellect. The intellect will shut off so it doesn't overburden. So you have no access to your buddhi.\n\nYour memory bank is completely out of your reach. So you cannot access your wisdom when you're angry. Therefore people say, well I, I did it because I was angry. That means it's not appropriate. But I did it because I was angry. So all my actions within the state of anger are actually not really good for me.\n\nWe all know that Bhagawan said so avoid karma so you don't have to get angry with Crowther. That's the second gate of and now what happens is if I have a lust for something or karma for something and I achieve that object easily then become greedy. I have the one time I've got it done. I buy a lotto for the first time and I get a hundred dollar prize. Well, looks like this is an easy pass. So I do it again and again.\n\nMaybe I can win a jackpot. So that success actually became problem for me. Because I now crave to get that experience again and again and again. When I fail at that, I'll be angry again. So at the end of the day I was nothing but angry. If I get what I want, I still will be angry.\n\nAnd if I don't get what I want, I still will be angry. So I live in the hell all the time.",
      "reflection": "Verses 19-20 describe the consequence of persistent demonic tendencies: birth after birth in environments that reinforce those same qualities. This is not divine punishment but natural law - whatever tendencies we cultivate, we become expert in; whatever path we follow, we continue along. Just as a person who builds a career in one field becomes increasingly specialized in that domain, someone who practices cruelty, hatred, and delusion becomes increasingly skilled at those patterns. The teaching warns that such souls, never recognizing their divine nature (mam aprapya), sink to lower and lower states (adhamam gatim). Examine your own \"expertise\": What patterns have you become increasingly skilled at through repetition? Are they patterns that liberate or bind? Today, consciously interrupt one negative pattern before it runs its usual course.\n\nVerse 21 offers the most practical guidance in this chapter: \"Trividham narakasya idam dvaram\" - there are three gates to hell: kama (lust/obsessive desire), krodha (anger), and lobha (greed). These three are the root destroyers of the Self. Notice how they interconnect: desire, when obstructed, becomes anger; desire, when fulfilled, becomes greed for more. The cycle is self-perpetuating. Krishna's prescription is simple: \"tasmad etat trayam tyajet\" - therefore, abandon these three. Today, keep a mental note each time you feel the pull of obsessive wanting, the heat of anger, or the grasping of greed. Do not judge yourself - simply observe. At day's end, review: Which gate did I approach most often? What triggered it? What would it mean to turn away from that gate rather than enter?"

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 16, Deva Asurasampatvibhaga yoga. Yoga of Differentiation between the divine and Devilish Estates. These are the two types of qualities we have acquired in this world, going through the various experiences throughout our life. And when we look at it from our perspective, for many lives, we've been going through many different experiences. These experiences leave impressions on my mind. Those impressions create tendencies.\n\nThose tendencies which I have is my wealth. That's all I carry around from one life to another. All other wealth which I consider my wealth right now is temporary and I have to leave behind. But this wealth which my tendencies I carry with me. So that's my permanent wealth, my permanent portfolio. So Bhagavan said that in that portfolio you may have divine qualities or divine tendencies and also devilish tendencies.\n\nPut simply: positive tendencies and negative tendencies. Positive, as we always know, is helpful. Negative, as we always know, is harmful. So these divine tendencies which I have are liberating. Bhagavan said in the beginning of the chapter, these are liberating tendencies. These tendencies will lead me to act in a manner which will liberate me from my limitations.\n\nLimitations are the ones which are binding me to sorrows and unhappiness. If I were powerful enough to own every piece of real estate in this town, then obviously I won't be competing for buying a house in Twin Hickory because I own everything. But because I am never infinite, this limitedness creates competitions and failures, and that creates sorrows and unhappiness. So we're going to say that these divine tendencies which you have acquired through your experiences, which align you more with your own self, are liberating from this bondage -- the bondage of identification with this body, mind and intellect, this limited self which I have right now considered to be my true self. On the other hand, there is the devilish tendency.\n\nNow in this case, even though the word devilish or diabolical sounds too negative, but they are basically tendencies born out of my ignorance. What is the truth about my own Self. So I come to the conclusion that there is no higher self. There is no one to control anything. Whatever I can do, I am by myself. Whatever I need, I need to do to get happiness.\n\nThat type of belief will lead me to do things which are only for the sense gratification. These creates the negative tendencies and binds me more and more to this limited self. Bhagawan said these tendencies are binding which are in our normal term. We call it a materialistic view of the world and materialistic approach to life. That this material will give me happiness. The things which I acquire from this world, things which I accomplish in this world will make me happy is the materialistic viewpoint.\n\nSpiritual viewpoint is if I can be happy by myself, then I really don't need anything to make me happy. Everything else may be just to fulfill my needs, but not wants. So desire to just sustain myself is not really unhealthy. But then when that desire become obsession for something and then it become unhealthy. As we know, everything in moderation is good. Even obsession to not do something can become very dangerous sometimes.\n\nSo Bhagavan described these tendencies and said that these are the tendencies you should avoid. These are tendencies you should try to cultivate in yourself. And then he came to the last topic. He initially said that we have talked about divine qualities a lot. \"We'll talk about these devilish qualities in detail. That's what we need to pay attention to.\" As I said in the beginning, our mind has a tendency to only see the divine in us.\n\nDivine qualities in us. Devilish qualities in others. Very easy to see what other people are doing wrong. Very difficult to see what I am doing wrong. We always enhance our resumes. We ask somebody to do his own self evaluation in the end of the year.\n\nIf you see his self-evaluation, there is no negative in it, period. His supervisor will find negatives in it. It is very important that we develop the discipline to introspect and find what is not right within my own thinking and negate them. Bhagavan says, these tendencies -- you must know these devilish tendencies. When you detect them in you, remove them so that you can move forward in your life.\n\nYour goal is to be happy. These tendencies will never make you happy. Even though it may seem that they will make me happy, they eventually make you unhappy -- and therefore avoid them. So you have seen that Bhagavan described what an asuric person looks like: Ahankaram Balam Darpam Kamam Krodham Cha Samshritah.\n\nThey are full of ego, power, self-conceit, lust and anger. Now we all have all of that in some degree. But if all of them together are powerful, then you become an Asura. If all five of them are at full capacity, then you become an Asura. Mam Atma Para Deheshu Pradvisanto Abhyasuyakah -- they hate my presence in them and in others. In other words, they have no value for life.\n\nThey will have no value of life, of their own or others. They will have no value for any noble act or have no desire or to appreciate other people. So they have no knowledge about what is divine in them or their own conscience. They will suppress their own conscience when it is trying to guide them for a right actions. And they will also not recognize the good intentions of others around them when others are trying to help them. These people will hate me in their own body and also in the others.\n\nTan Aham Dvishatah Kruran Samsareshu Naradhaman Kshipami Ajasram Ashubhan. To these cruel doers, the lowest of men -- as I said, when you are qualified for this distinction, when all five of those qualities are fully developed in you, there is no room for any divine tendency. Then Bhagavan says, I send them to the lowest of the yonis. And we have discussed last time: it is not that Bhagavan is punishing.\n\nSo Bhagavan is not sitting there and punishing people. Because you are not doing this right, your own actions will lead you towards the lower and lower state of existence. Whatever the tendency you develop, that is the environment you will feel comfortable. My tendency is to come to Gita class. I will feel comfortable here and somebody may be comfortable doing something else. Because their tendencies.\n\nIf your tendency leads you down to this path of the Hankara, Balam, Darpam, Kamam Krudam, you will be born into the same environment again. If you consider this sense gratification is the only goal of life then obviously you will be only seeking that environment. And Bhagawan said, I, as the lawgiver and law enforcement forcer in this world put them into the lowest yoni again and again. Asurim Yonim Apanna Muda Janmani Janmani. Birth after birth, having born in the demonic wombs. Because that's the path I have chosen.\n\nWhatever path I take, I become good at that. So you start your career in engineering or architecture, medicine. You do the first project and the second project and in a short time you'll have a huge portfolio of work you do. And suddenly, whether you like it or not, you become an expert in that. And other people say, but you are only expert in this. We can give you work in this field because you only do this.\n\nThat's how we become all experts in something. Because we continue to do the same thing over and over again in the same line of work or same line of actions. So these people are now becoming expert in asuric existence. Ashram yuni mapanna by taking birth in Ashram yuni again and again. Mama aprapyevakantoya tatoyati Adhamam gatim. They continue their existing without attaining me, Attaining me.\n\nBy not recognizing their own self. They continue their existence from one life to another without recognizing what is divine in them, without recognizing the sanctity of life. And yantim adamam gatim. And they continue to go lower and lower and lower. Because that's the path they are pursuing, they are progressing into. Then he says, trivedam naraka sidham dwaram.\n\nUp till now we have discussed what the divine qualities are, what the devilish qualities are, who are divine, and who are devilish. But what is the root cause of these devilish qualities? This verse gives us the cause and also the prescription for how to avoid them. Trividham Narakasya Idam Dvaram Nashanam Atmanah. These three are the gates of hell, which are the destroyers of the self. Kamah, Krodhah, Tatha Lobhah -- lust, anger and greed.\n\nThese are the only three things which you have to avoid, Bhagawan. Now knowing this, we fall prey to these three. Because how the karma works is once you start thinking about some object. When you constantly think about any object, you develop attachment to it. Then you create a desire for that. If you don't get that object, you're a krodha.\n\nSo you created attachment. That attachment became lust. Lust in a sense, I ought to have it. Without that, life is not worth living. So that becomes a kamaha. A normal desire to buy a car is not a kamah because I need it for transportation.\n\nBut it becomes obsessed and I have to have BMW and then BMW, BMW, BMW. Then it's a problem if I don't get it. Because I said I can buy BMW in $50,000. And then by the time I accumulate 50,000, the car has gone to 60,000 or 70,000. It almost is slightly above my pay grade. And that will make me angry.\n\nSo Bhagavan said, that's the mechanism of lust. A normal desire is innocent. I'm thirsty, I need water. I have a desire to drink water. I get up, get a glass of water, and I'm done with it. But a constant obsession about something becomes kama.\n\nWhen that obsession is obstructed and I cannot attain what I want, I become angry. So that Krodha, we all learned in chapter two the anger. It shuts down my buddhi. Because we have this safety mechanism just like the breaker trips and electricity that to protect integrity of your mind and intellect. The intellect will shut off so it doesn't overburden. So you have no access to your buddhi.\n\nYour memory bank is completely out of your reach. So you cannot access your wisdom when you're angry. Therefore people say, well I, I did it because I was angry. That means it's not appropriate. But I did it because I was angry. So all my actions within the state of anger are actually not really good for me.\n\nWe all know that Bhagawan said so avoid karma so you don't have to get angry with Crowther. That's the second gate of and now what happens is if I have a lust for something or karma for something and I achieve that object easily then become greedy. I have the one time I've got it done. I buy a lotto for the first time and I get a hundred dollar prize. Well, looks like this is an easy pass. So I do it again and again.\n\nMaybe I can win a jackpot. So that success actually became problem for me. Because I now crave to get that experience again and again and again. When I fail at that, I'll be angry again. So at the end of the day I was nothing but angry. If I get what I want, I still will be angry.\n\nAnd if I don't get what I want, I still will be angry. So I live in the hell all the time.",
      "reflection": "Verse 22 offers the positive counterpart to the previous warning: one who is freed from the three gates of darkness - lust, anger, and greed - naturally acts for their own highest good (acharaty atmanah shreyah) and attains the supreme goal (param gatim). This is liberation not as escape from the world but as freedom within it - the ability to act wisely without being driven by compulsion. Notice that Krishna does not say such a person has no desires, never feels irritation, or wants nothing. Rather, they are vimuktah - freed from being controlled by these forces. Today, practice this freedom in one small area: when desire arises, acknowledge it without acting on impulse; when irritation surfaces, feel it without speaking harshly; when greed whispers \"more,\" recognize the voice without obeying. This is the beginning of liberation.\n\nVerse 23-24 establish scripture (shastra) as the guide for determining what should and should not be done (karya-akarya-vyavasthitau). When we act merely from desire (kama-karatah), we achieve neither perfection (siddhi), nor happiness (sukham), nor the supreme goal. This teaching acknowledges our tendency to rationalize - \"I know what is right for me\" - while being driven by hidden motives. Scripture serves as an objective standard, a wisdom accumulated over millennia, that can check our self-deception. Practically, this means: before major decisions, consult the teachings; when confused about right action, return to the principles you have studied. Ask yourself today: In what area of life am I acting purely from personal desire while convincing myself it is right? What would the scriptural wisdom - non-injury, truthfulness, non-attachment - counsel in that situation? Let this chapter's teaching be your compass when your own judgment is clouded."

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing the Bhagavad Gita, starting from chapter one, Arjuna Vishada Yoga. The Gita opens with Dhritarashtra. Dhritarashtra, as we have discussed, is our state of mind. Right now we live in the Dhritarashtra state. We are blind to our reality, the supreme reality, the real reality. We are blind to the truth that I am part of that supreme being, and instead we live in the world of Mamakaha -- I and mine.\n\nSo that's basically how the Bhagavad Gita started: this is our problem. All our problems start with that one misunderstanding that I am this limited being, that Mamakaha is my world, I and mine is my world. And then I separate the rest of the world as something other than me. The next few verses focus on Duryodhana -- the Duryodhana in us.\n\nThis Duryodhana represents the thief in us -- the part that wants to take away something which belongs to somebody else and make it mine. I want it so badly that I will use any means to get it. All over our day-to-day life we see inequality in our society, because obviously there is wealth which is common to all, given by God, natural. Yet somebody hoards so much and doesn't leave enough for the others.\n\nSo the Duryodhana in us wants this thing so badly. He knows it's not his, but he wants it. And therefore he is always very anxious, because he has decided: I need to have it. I know it is not mine, but I need to have it for my own happiness, to make myself complete.\n\nThis sense of incompleteness started with our state of Dhritarashtra. Because we are blind to our reality, we make ourselves limited to this self, and that I-and-mine creates incompleteness. That incompleteness has created a thief in us -- I want to take away from others and make it mine so that I will feel complete. That's what Duryodhana felt all his life: I need all this kingdom for myself. He was already given half the kingdom after the first match of chess, and now he wants all of it.\n\nSo his mental state is that of any thief who is trying to steal something away from somebody else. One, he is insecure -- when you are trying to steal something, you wonder: is somebody watching me? So there is insecurity, and then fear. Obviously you are fearful, you are insecure. That's why you want to make sure you get what you want by any means.\n\nSo there are three things in that mentality: I want this so badly that I'll be willing to do anything; I'm insecure; and I'm fearful. The next few verses we have seen are just describing this. The first six verses said:\n\nLook at the Pandava's army -- it looks pretty well protected. Great warriors on their side. He is basically going to Drona and saying, these are all your Shishyas. Arjun, son of Drupada, Drishtadharamna, who is now commanding the army. So I'm not sure that we are totally protected having somebody like Drona with us, because his shishyas are on the other side. That's a fear in him.\n\nSo he describes all that he feels are the weak points from looking at the other side. And now he realizes that he may have gone overboard. When somebody is in that state, he wants to cover both bases.\n\nOn one side he feels insecure. On the other side he feels very powerful -- I have all the shrewdness and smartness and strength to do it. So first he looked at his insecurity and his weaknesses, seeing the other side as powerful. Now he's looking at it differently: no, no, I can do it. So from verse 7 onwards, he now looks at his strength.\n\nAsmakamtu Visishtaye Tani Bauda Dwijottama. Obviously he's addressing Drona, and he said Dvijottama. We have discussed before: Dwijottama, Dwija, Brahmin. Brahmin is considered twice born. One is a physical birth, and the second is a birth in this knowledge of who you are, which starts at the time of Upanayam when the Guru gives a mantra in his ear. Then he goes to the Gurukul to get that education and becomes established in this knowledge.\n\nThat's why it's called Dwij -- because the first is just a physical birth for a limited being, and the second birth is where he takes birth as a wise person.\n\nSo therefore they are called Dwijaha. Drona, being a Brahmin, is Dwijaha. But he said Dwijottama -- you are the best among the Brahmins. Now this could have been the best compliment in a normal situation.\n\nBut in this situation it is not because we know or at least the society knew at the time. Brahmins are soft hearted. They are not fighting type. They are not war mongerers. They are not the ones who can be in the situation. They want to avoid this type of conflict.\n\nWe have seen that that's how Karna was caught by Parasuram. Karna went to Parasuram because he realized that other than Drona, Parasuram could teach him what the other Pandavas were learning. Parasuram had taken a vow that he would not teach any Kshatriya, because he wanted to eliminate Kshatriyas from this planet. He would not teach this art of warfare to any Kshatriya.\n\nSo Karna goes there as a Dvija, as a Brahmin. He disguises himself as a Brahmin -- lies that he is a Brahmin.\n\nAnd then obviously he was a good student. One day, the teacher was sleeping with his head in Karna's lap. A bumblebee comes and sits on Karna's thigh. He realizes that if he moves, his Guru will be disturbed, and he does not want to make his Guru uncomfortable at all.\n\nThe Guru is in a deep sleep. This bumblebee bores through his flesh and blood is oozing out of that wound. He tolerates all that pain but does not move a muscle, so that his Guru won't be disturbed in his sleep. The blood comes running down his thigh, under the Guru's head.\n\nThe Guru wakes up because of the warm blood he feels. He sees what's happening, realizes what has occurred, and Karna says, I'm fine. But the Guru was angry. He said: you lied to me. You are not a Brahmin. A Brahmin would not have been capable of tolerating this kind of pain. You are a Kshatriya who lied to me.\n\nAnd then obviously, as the story goes, Karna asked for forgiveness and all of that. But Parasuram said: you will have this knowledge, but it will not come handy to you when you really need it in the battlefield. You will lose this knowledge.\n\nThe relevance here is that Dvija is not a positive compliment when you are in a war. So Duryodhana reminds Drona: look, I know you are a great teacher and a great archer and a great warrior, but in the end you are a Dvija -- so don't be soft-hearted here.\n\nIt's actually his fear that maybe this guy will go soft-hearted and will not fight this battle. Sangartam tan bravi mi te -- therefore I am going to now describe to you who are the great warriors on our side. Don't go soft-hearted on me.\n\nWe have also great people on our side. You don't need to worry about it. You just do your job. Bhavan Bismast Chakranastha starting with you Bhavan, you who are on our side so that we feel that we are protected. Bhavan, you Bisma, Karna, Krupastha, Samitin, Jaya and Krupacharya who are victorious. All these people have good track record of resume of winning battle.\n\nAsvathama, Vikranscha, Somadatt, Tatha, Evacharya and then all others like Asvathrama. Last time we have seen Kurupacharya is Dronacharya's brother in law and Aswathrama is Dronacharya's son. So Swamiji says here or we can't have in one family all this bravery and valor. So he's obviously making it up a little more than what he should be. But whatever it is, these are all great warriors. Swathama was more like Duryodhana.\n\nHe was Duryodhana's best friend and was basically looking for this: if he stays with Duryodhana and Duryodhana wins the war, then he will have a kingdom of his own. Drona and Drupada were friends and they probably learned together at some Guru's place. Drona goes to Drupada asking for some favor to make him a Raja somewhere, and Drupada insults him.\n\nThat's where their animosity started. So the long story all weaved into it. But in the end basically Duryodhana said these are all people, the great people on our side and not only the main characters but Anyeche, Baha, Bahasuraha, Madharte, Tyakta, Jeevitaha and there are many others on our side who are ready to give up their life for me. Many, many brave people are on our side. In other words, they're committed to fight this war. Yudwijotama, I'm not sure about you but I'm sure about everybody else.\n\nThey are committed to fight. So let's do the right thing here. Nana Sastra Praharanaha, Sarve, Yuddha, Visharadaha. Not only they are ready to fight for me but they are equipped with various types of weapons. So we are well equipped. We have a human capital, we have technology.\n\nSo let's not worry about it. Yudda Visaradaha they are expert in warfare. This verse obviously confuses everybody -- why \"Apar Yaptam,\" insufficient? Now every translation I have seen does say \"insufficient,\" even though it seems that \"unlimited\" is more appropriate here. I had asked Swamiji one time: Swamiji, all this translation, where does that come from?\n\nAnd Swamiji says we don't get involved in this because you need a Sanskrit pandit to translate this. He says there are Sanskrit pandits in Kashi who have translated the Bhagavad Gita after thorough discussion, and that's the translation we use. So even the Chinmaya Mission translation does not really come from Chinmayananda and the Swamis -- it actually came from Pandits who decided on the translation. So we have to take it as it is and say Apar Yaptam in our vernacular languages.\n\nApariyapta is insufficient. He's saying it's insufficient. Now remember, his mentality is that of a thief. He always feels that he is incomplete. No matter how much that person has, he will always feel there is something more he should have.\n\nAnd therefore his vision about what we have is never that we are sufficient. We have plenty, so why even be fighting this battle? But even the army he sees as insufficient. All these people who went on Pandava's side -- they actually should have been on my side, and then it would have been much better. And my army is protected by Bheeshma, because he knew that Bheeshma has taken a vow that as long as he lives, he will guard the throne of Hastinapur.\n\nWhoever is in Hastinapur, he will be protecting him. He also knows that Bheeshma has Ichamrityu -- he will only die if he wants to die. As long as Bheeshma is alive, he is protected. So on one hand, he knows that as long as Bheeshma is on his side, he obviously does not have to worry. But at the same token he thinks: if I had more, then I would have felt a little better about it.\n\nSo he said: Apariyaptam Tadasnakam Balam Vishna Bhirakshitam -- our strength protected by Bhishma still feels a little insufficient. Whereas on the other side, Pariyaptam twidam Etesham Balam Bhima Bhirakshitam -- they are protected by Bhima. And then last time, Sid or somebody pointed out that this is not correct. Bhima was not the commander; the commander was changing every day in this army.\n\nIf you read the Mahabharata -- and I have never read it, so I'm not an authority on this.",
      "reflection": "These opening verses reveal a profound truth: \"As is the faith, so is the person\" (yo yacchraddhaḥ sa eva saḥ). Krishna teaches that our faith is not merely what we intellectually believe, but the deep orientation of our entire being - it arises from our svabhava, our inherent nature shaped by past experiences and tendencies. This faith, whether sattvic, rajasic, or tamasic, colors everything we perceive and pursue. When Arjuna asks about those who worship with faith but set aside scriptural guidance, Krishna does not condemn them. Instead, he reveals that faith itself is the defining factor of who we become.\n\nTake time today to honestly examine: What do you truly have faith in? Not what you think you should believe, but what actually drives your decisions when no one is watching. When faced with a difficult choice, what conviction do you fall back on? Consider keeping a \"faith journal\" this week - note the moments when your deepest convictions reveal themselves, whether in moments of stress, temptation, or quiet reflection. Ask yourself: Does my faith lead me toward light and clarity (sattva), toward restless ambition (rajas), or toward confusion and inertia (tamas)? Remember, awareness of our current state is the first step toward transformation."

The chapter opened with Arjuna's question: if someone has not understood the Sastras, or even having understood, he sets aside the prescription in the Shastras, but has faith in what he thinks is right and is pursuing his faith -- does that faith be considered Sattvik, Rajasik, or Tamasic?\n\nThat's a simple question, simply because in the last chapter, the clear advice by Krishna is to follow the prescriptions of the Sastras in deciding what to do and what not to do. And as we have seen, Sastras literally means the collective wisdom of your culture, your society, your ancestors. So unless I really rely on the wisdom of my ancestors, I will have no foundation to decide what is right and wrong. Any profession, any science -- you build on what has already been tried and true and proven in the labs or in workshops, and then say, now where do I go from here?\n\nSo the clear prescription was not to ignore the wisdom of your ancestors, your civilization, your culture, and then decide what is right and wrong for you. It's not saying that you don't think yourself, but think based on the tried and true wisdom. When we go to high school and learn chemistry and the teacher says H2O makes water, well, you have to have some faith in him. Unless you have faith, you will not learn, because you have faith in the teacher that you will accept that and then you will prove yourself going to the lab. So the prescription was follow the Sastras and decide what to do and not to do. Arjuna's question is, if someone completely sets aside the prescription in Sastras for lack of knowledge or lack of faith in the Sastras, but he has a faith in something he believes in, does that faith to be classified as Sattvik Rajasik or Tamasic?\n\nBecause as we have seen, everything can be classified Sattvik, Rajasik, or Tamasic. Bhagavan said: I'll tell you, it's not a one-label-fits-all type of answer. Your faith will be as you are. My faith will be as per my experiences. Every time I walk into the airport, I'm absolutely sure the plane will be on time -- if the last few times I went there the plane was on time, I'll say it will be on time. But if the last few times I'd been going there it was always late, what will be my faith? Chances are my flight will be delayed.\n\nSo anytime I'm going to India, what I do is I leave about six hours of gap between when I go from Richmond to New Jersey airport and New Jersey to Mumbai. We have no faith that the flight from Richmond to New Jersey will take me in time. They say, keep a two-hour gap. No, no -- six hours gap.\n\nYou don't want to miss an international flight. That's my faith in our airline based on my experience. And then the other people may have other things. So Bhagavan said that your faith is Sattva Anurupa. It in accordance with your own self, your own core of your being, core of your mind. So my faith will be what my experiences are.\n\nFaith is something that comes intuitively to you, more like a tendency. Why do I like music? I don't know -- that's my tendency. But the more I follow my tendency, the more I will be following that path. The more I have faith in the Gita, the more Gita I will read; the more I read the Gita, the more faith I have in it.\n\nSo the two are wedded together. The more faith I have, the more I will pursue that path. The more I pursue that path, the more my faith increases. So Bhagavan said, it is the individual who decides whether he will have faith which is Sattvik, Rajasic, or Tamasic, depending on the tendencies of his mind. Yajante Sattvika Devan -- so if the overall makeup of my mind is Sattvik, what will I do?\n\nWell, I will follow Sattvic beings. I will strive to pursue or worship divine beings. My role models depend on my tendencies. If I am pursuing wealth, my role model is Bill Gates. If I want to be a great leader, my role model will be Mahatma Gandhi. If I want to be spiritual, my role model will be Swami Chinmayananda.\n\nDepending on my faith, my role model would be different. That's as simple as that. So Bhagavan said: Sattvika Yajante Devan -- one whose makeup is Sattvik, predominantly Sattvik. These are not exclusive qualities of one person, one thing, or one being. Everything is made up of some combination of Sattvik, Rajasik, and Tamasic.\n\nBut if my mental makeup is predominantly Sattvik, I will be pursuing the Deva, the divine beings, Yaksa, Rakshansi, Rajasaha, those who are Rajasik will pursue or worship Yakshas and Rakshasas. From the Puranas we have the descriptions of Devas and Yakshas and Rakshasas, but it's simply told here is Sattvik will follow the divine beings, Rajasik will follow the one which has wealth and power. Yaksas are supposed to be wealthy beings. There is a story in Mahabharata 1 where Yudhishthir goes to this lake when he wants to drink water. That lake was controlled by a Yaksha. Yaksha said, you can't drink water till you answer all my questions.\n\nIf you answer all my questions, I'll let you take water. In other words, he was the controller of that lake. He was wealthy enough to control his lake. These days people own islands because they're wealthy. So the Yaksa that the wealthy beings, and as Swamiji points out here in Purana, I say they're Kubera's brothers or cousins. So they're wealthy beings or Rakshasa's immense power.\n\nThere are stories in Puranas about Rakshasas' immense power. In other words, even in society there will be people who are Sattvic and people who are wealthy and powerful. So if my tendency is Rajasic, then I will be pursuing the wealthy and powerful. If my quality is Sattvik, I'll pursue the divine being. Preta Bhuta Ganas -- the others who have Tamasic qualities will pursue the Preta and Bhuta. We obviously know from our vernacular languages that Preta and Bhuta are the dead spirits.\n\nNow in this society, if there are three people pursuing the same goal of making a million, the one with a Sattvik tendency will say: let's find some creative way which will help the society and at the same time create the wealth -- and that's how I'll make my million. The Rajasik will say: let's destroy my competition or take over someone else, and I'll get my million. And the last one will say: let's pursue the lottery, buy the Mega Millions. All three have the same goal, but all three have a different avenue to reach there.\n\nNow all three are working hard to achieve the same goal -- making a million. The Sattvic person is working very hard to achieve his goal creatively. The Rajasic is working just as hard but competitively. The Tamasic is also working hard but relying on chance. Their means are different, depending on where their faith is. The one who's pursuing the lottery has complete faith that he cannot get a million in any other way -- this is the only way he can make a million.\n\nThe one who wants to employ himself in a business has complete faith he can succeed that way. And the Sattvic person has complete faith that if he creates something good for society, he will also benefit from it. Depending on your own experiences, your mental makeup is made. That mental makeup now defines where I have the faith in. That faith will lead me into my actions.\n\nSo Bhagavan said these faiths cannot be labeled simply because someone is not following Sastra. He may not know the Sastras but has Sattvic tendencies -- he will follow Sattva. He may not know Sastras but has Rajasic tendencies -- he is following Rajasik. And he may not know Sastras because he's Tamasic -- he's following Tamas.\n\nSo Preta and Bhuta are the dead spirits. In other words, normal society will consider that to be a non-starter. Somebody says, well Neil, why don't you buy a lottery? I never won anything in my life. Let's not waste my dollar.\n\nAt least I have a dollar. After that I won't have a dollar. But somebody has the faith and says, well, I have $10, I'll put nine of them in the lottery. I'm pretty much against the lottery, by the way, because we're taxing the people who can afford the least in the society. They say lottery is good for education, it will reduce your taxes. No -- it's a tax on the people who cannot afford that tax. Most lottery tickets are bought by people who can least afford it.\n\nBut they are following their faith. Asastra vihitam ghoram tapyante ye tapo janaha. Now I have my faith that this is how I can pursue my goal. My faith is dependent on my experiences.\n\nSo now I'm pursuing my goal vigorously because I'm as sincere as anybody else. But I'm pursuing it in a field which I think is the most conducive for me to achieve that -- not knowing what is right or wrong because I did not take time to find out. I'm working very hard. As I said last time, I want to go to New Jersey, but I'm driving as fast as I can on I-95 south just because I didn't take time to figure out whether New Jersey is north or south, without knowing what is right or wrong from the tried and true wisdom of my society.\n\nIf I had just taken the directions from AAA or a GPS, it would tell me New Jersey is to the north. But I didn't take it. I didn't want to take that time. They're working very hard. They are pursuing these austerities vigorously. Dambha ahankara sanyuktaha -- because they're filled with dambha, hypocrisy.\n\nAnd ahankara, ego -- nobody knows better than I do. So who are they to tell me that New Jersey is to the north? I know it's got to be this way. Ahankara sanyuktaha, Kama raga balanvitaha -- they are propelled to do this by what? Kama, desire, and raga, attachment.\n\nKama and raga are propelling my actions, and I think my happiness lies there. My goal is to achieve happiness, just as everybody else's is. But I think my happiness lies in these actions, where others are saying no -- that's where you have the danger that you probably will be unhappy. We tell our kids: don't do that. But at that time the child does not think he is going to get hurt.\n\nBut if he listens to you -- you as an elder person have learned from your own experience that jumping from that second floor is going to get you in trouble. A young person, at the age of 8 or 9 or 10, thinks he can do anything he wants. Propelled by that desire and attachment, he wants to show off to his friend that he can jump from the second story. We have seen that in our childhood. Hypocrisy and arrogance, the ego filled with that and propelled by attachment and desire.\n\nAnd they are putting vigorous actions in the fields which they consider appropriate for them. Karshayantaha Sarirastham bhutagramam a Chaitasaha. This is a description of someone who has completely ignored the advice from the Sastras. We read the Bhagavad Gita every Sunday -- what do we do after that? The Bhagavad Gita says one thing, but that's not really what we follow.\n\nSo now we fall into this category. Knowing fully well, we set aside the prescription in the Shastra. We are propelled by our desire and our attachments, and also we are dambha ahankara sanyukta.",
      "reflection": "These verses present a sobering warning about misguided worship and extreme practices. Krishna describes those who, driven by hypocrisy (dambha), ego (ahankara), desire (kama), and attachment (raga), perform harsh austerities not prescribed by scriptures. Most striking is the statement that such people \"torment the organs of the body\" and \"harass Me also, Who lives within\" - revealing that when we abuse our body-mind complex through extreme or misguided practices, we are actually disrespecting the Divine that dwells within us. The sattvic worship Devas (divine beings representing light and wisdom), the rajasic pursue Yakshas and Rakshasas (representing wealth and power), while the tamasic follow spirits of the dead.\n\nExamine your own spiritual practices and the role models you follow. Who are your \"Devas\" - the ideals and beings you worship through your attention and energy? If you seek wealth above all, your role model might be a billionaire; if wisdom, perhaps a sage; if power, perhaps a political figure. Today, notice when ego or the desire to show off enters your spiritual practice. Do you meditate to genuinely purify the mind, or partly to feel superior to others? Do you practice austerities that honor the body as a temple, or do you engage in extreme behaviors driven by pride or self-punishment? Ask yourself: Are my practices nourishing the Divine within, or harassing it?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 17, Shraddha Traya Vibhaga Yoga, yoga of three types of faith. We have seen in the last chapter, when Bhagavan ended the chapter, he gave the advice to Arjuna: do everything in life according to the advice given in the scriptures or by the sages. That's how you will acquire more divine qualities. And these divine qualities are liberating -- they will liberate you from your limitations which are creating sorrows in life.\n\nIf you do not follow that, you may incur more negative tendencies which will be more binding. They bind you to this material world. So Bhagavan said that follow the scriptural advice when you decide what to do and what not to do in this world. So obvious question Arjuna had was that what about the people who never had a chance to refer to scriptures? Either by their own choice, that they didn't think it was important, or they never had an opportunity to learn scriptures. And we can imagine in that society, probably the larger mass of people were not allowed to even learn scripture.\n\nArjuna had a very logical doubt: what happens to all those people? They are working in this world with faith. They have a faith that this is the right way to live life, which will give them happiness. Because at the end of the day, as we have discussed, the goal of life is to be happy. No matter who we are, our goal in life is very simple.\n\nWe all want to be happy. If I look at my entire life, it is divided into two pursuits: one is to achieve happiness, and the other is to avoid unhappiness. Bhagavan said we are all working toward the same goal. But those who do not listen to the advice in the scriptures, the books of knowledge, teachers, wise people, ancestors -- they suffer by developing wrong tendencies. Those who follow the advice from the wise people, because they've gone through that and come to the conclusion this is the right way to act, will benefit from that and acquire the divine, liberating tendencies.\n\nArjuna said: the people in this world, working in their field, in their life, with faith but having no knowledge of what is prescribed in the scriptures -- as I said, either by choice (they decided it's not worth it) or they never had a chance. So what is the nature of their sraddha? They have sraddha too -- that this is where I'll get my happiness in life. Is it Sattvic, Rajasic, or Tamasic? Because if it is just out of my ignorance, one would say that is tamasic. Bhagavan said it is all of the above.\n\nIt can be any of the three. If you have not referred to the scriptures but still have faith, your faith can be of any of these three, and at any given time it can be one or another. It is predominantly whatever my personality is -- my faith will be according to my personality. As the faith, so is the person. As the person, so is the faith.\n\nSo it's a symbiotic relationship. Whichever field I choose to work in, I eventually become an expert in that. I go to architecture school, work in architecture field. More I work in that field, more I get knowledge. More my tendencies become to work in that field. And after about 30 years you become an expert in that field.\n\nAt that point somebody says, you made a mistake, Neil, you should have gone to medical school -- you would have made lots of money. Yeah, I'd want to switch overnight but can't do it because my tendencies are now firmly established in the field I've been working in all my life. Bhagavan says the same thing happens with your shraddha. Whatever shraddha you have, you will continue to pursue that path and have similar experiences. And it will make your shraddha even firmer.\n\nThe firmer your shraddha becomes, the more it becomes your nature, your personality. That's how you can identify or label a person as a Sattvic person, a Rajasic person, or a Tamasic person, depending on the predominant nature of their personality. Bhagavan said their faith can be Sattvic, Rajasic, or Tamasic. And then he said that depending on their personality, everything they do will be guided by that faith. The food they eat, the disciplines they practice, the charities they do -- all will be guided by their personality, whether Sattvic, Rajasic, or Tamasic.\n\nAnd therefore he said, now we'll discuss in detail what these are. So we have seen the verse: Ahara Tu Api Sarvasya Trividho Bhavati Priyaha. We have to pay attention to the words. Here all he's saying is that ahara, the food, also becomes dear to these people in three different ways. Depending on your personality, your faith, your tendencies, you will like one type of food or another. He did not say that these foods are inherently Sattvic, Rajasic, or Tamasic.\n\nThese qualities depend on the mood of your mind. We all know that there are times you like to eat some chatpata, spicy food. And times you really want to stay away from it. Early morning somebody says have idli dosa for breakfast. But we went to the South and there, early morning, the breakfast comes -- idli dosa. And I said, are you serious that you want me to eat idli dosa at this hour?\n\nI thought it's lunchtime. No, in the breakfast also idli dosa. So depending on my mood, I like one type of food or another. Yajna, tapah, tatha danam -- not only food is driven by the mood of my mind. These sattvic, rajasic and tamasic qualities are not inherent in the things we see in this world.\n\nThey're actually the qualities of my mind -- the moods of my mind. That mind will decide whether something is sattvic, rajasic, or tamasic. So depending on my mood, I will decide what I like. Bhagavan said even the food you like will be dependent on the mood of your mind. Whether sattvic, rajasic, or tamasic. Even the efforts you make.\n\nYajna -- traditionally we call that havan, which we do with fire and put offerings in it. Basically all your life you're doing yajna by putting your efforts, offering your actions in this yajna of your life. That will also be determined by the mood of your mind. The disciplines which you follow -- tapas, austerities -- not just sitting with folded legs. Everything you do to discipline yourself is basically tapas.\n\nIf you have to run a marathon, you have to do tapas for that, right? You have to train for that. That's your tapas. That will be determined by the mood of your mind -- whether sattvic, rajasic, or tamasic.\n\nWhere do I make charities when I give something back to society? He says that will also depend on the mood of my mind. Some people will donate toward hospitals and health care. Some toward a sports complex. Whatever you think is dear to your heart, that's where you are going to make charities. Bhagavan said everything in your life will be driven by your faith, your conviction -- whether it is sattvic, rajasic, or tamasic.\n\nYour life will be driven by that. And therefore he said, let's talk about how that affects you. Ayuh sattva bala arogya sukha priti vivardhanah rasyah snigdhah sthira hrdya aharah sattvikapriyah. You really have to be very careful in reading this verse. First of all, it says that if the mood of my mind is sattvic, what do I want to get out of my life? My sattvic mood will say that I want Ayuh -- I want to prolong my life through my efforts.\n\nI want to live a pure life, a long life. Bala, strength -- doesn't mean I want to be like Hercules, but means I don't have to be dependent on others for help. Arogya, health. Health is my real nature. I don't wake up any morning and say, I don't know why I'm feeling so good -- let me call my doctor, there's got to be something wrong. Because that's my nature, my real nature. I take it for granted. My health is my nature.\n\nIt's when I'm not healthy that I notice. Whatever it is, let's take care of it, because it's not my real nature. So Bhagavan said sukha, priti -- I want to be comfortable. Nobody wants to be uncomfortable.\n\nI want to choose the food which will make me comfortable. Priti doesn't mean falling in love with somebody. Priti means something that makes me feel good. So I decide what my goal is in eating food first. My goal in eating food is to have ayuh, sattva, bala, arogya, sukha, and priti.\n\nAnd I want to eat the food which promotes this kind of health. So that's the mood of my sattvic mind. And therefore the food he or she chooses would be rasyah, snigdhah, sthira, hrdya. Snigdhah doesn't mean oily with lots of calories. It means fresh, substantial, has nutritional value. Hrdya means agreeable, which works with my system, which I can digest.\n\nRasyah, snigdhah, sthira, hrdya. So either I'm living to eat, or eating to live, is the question. Here he says the sattvic person will first decide what they want to get out of food. This is the purpose of eating: I want to increase my ayuh, sattva, my purity, my strength, my health, my comfort and my mood. So let's find out which food will be agreeable for me to do that.\n\nAnd we find that rasyah, snigdhah, sthira, hrdya -- the fresh foods, pure food, healthy food -- are the ones which will give me that. Therefore sattvic people like this type of food. That's all Bhagavan said here. He did not say eat this or don't eat this, or that people who eat other foods are not good. He said because your goal of life is to increase these types of qualities, you will choose that type of food.\n\nIn the next verse he says katva amla lavana atyushna tikshna ruksha vidahinah, ahara rajasasya ishta duhkha shoka amaya pradah. This type of food rajasic people like -- bitter, sour, salty, overly hot, pungent, dry, burning. But in the end he says the result would be this. See, in the first verse he said what the sattvic goal is. The sattvic person decided what their goal is first, then chose the food. The rajasic person decided the food I like, that's why I'm going to eat it.\n\nThen Bhagavan said the result would be duhkha, shoka, amaya pradah. This food gives you duhkha, discomfort. Anybody who went to a party, had a good dose of hors d'oeuvres, and then dinner at 10:30 -- tell me, was that the best night you had? It was uncomfortable. I'll tell you what, I didn't sleep well that night.\n\nI wish I had controlled myself. Shoka, grief, and amaya, disease. Katva, amla, lavana, atyushna, tikshna, ruksha, vidahinah -- bitter, sour, salty, extremely hot, pungent, dry, burning. Now Bhagavan didn't say this food is bad. He also did not say don't eat this food.\n\nHe said the result of this food will be duhkha, shoka, amaya pradah. These foods will result in discomfort, grief and disease. But he said when I'm in a rajasic mood, I don't really have time to think about my food. So whatever is tasty, I will eat that. In a rajasic mode, it's not that one group of people only eat this and another group only eat that. When I am in a sattvic mood I'll be very careful about what I'm eating. When I'm in a rajasic mood I'll say I don't really care -- I'm on a one-day trip, whatever.",
      "reflection": "These verses introduce a fascinating principle: even something as basic as food preference reveals the texture of our mind. Krishna describes how sattvic foods are \"rasyah snigdhah sthira hrdya\" - juicy, wholesome, substantial, and pleasing to the heart - and they promote longevity, purity, strength, health, and cheerfulness. Rajasic foods are bitter, sour, salty, overly hot, pungent, and dry, leading to discomfort, grief, and disease. Notice that Bhagavan does not command \"eat this, not that\" - rather, he reveals that our food preferences mirror our mental state, and our food choices reinforce that state.\n\nThis week, practice mindful eating as a spiritual discipline. Before each meal, pause and ask: \"Am I eating to live, or living to eat?\" Notice your cravings - are you reaching for fresh, nourishing foods that promote vitality (sattvic), or for stimulating \"comfort foods\" loaded with spices and calories (rajasic)? When in a hurry, do you grab whatever is available without thought (tamasic)? The teaching here is not about rigid dietary rules, but about using food as a mirror for self-knowledge. Try one meal this week eaten in complete silence, savoring each bite, noticing how different foods affect your energy and mental clarity. Remember: your body is the vehicle for spiritual growth, and how you fuel it reflects - and shapes - your inner state."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 17, Shraddha Traya Vibhaga Yoga, three types of sraddhas. Culturally we are obsessed with classifications, so we classify everything. In this case, Arjuna asked the question: if somebody does not have any guidance from the Sastras -- either voluntarily rejected or not available -- but he still has faith and is working, propelled by his faith, what type of faith is that? Bhagavan says: as the man, so is his faith; also, as the faith, so is the man. Both have a very synergistic relationship.\n\nMy faith and who I am are basically very closely related to each other. And therefore this chapter is all about explaining the types of faith one can develop. If I have a goal to be one type of a person or other, I should examine what type of faith do I have? Or I should at least see that what type of faith will lead me to the goal which I want to achieve. So therefore the whole discussion about the three types of faith, and obviously it was quite anticipated after learning 16 chapters of Bhagavad Gita, that these three types of faith correspond with the three qualities of Maya, Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. Everything can be the Sattvik, Rajasik or Tamasic.\n\nOnce again we have to remember that nothing we have discussed ever said that one quality can be exclusive of other two. The one quality always comes with the little shades of the other two. But it is the predominance of my personality or my faith makes me who I am. The worship people do are also depending on their faith. Sattvicas will worship the Devas -- in other words, to get the illumination of their mind. They want the light of knowledge in their internal instruments. The Rajasic wants to achieve wealth, prosperity, something they think will give them infinite happiness. But we know it is transitory.\n\nThe goal is the same for all of us: liberation from our sorrows and unhappiness. We should examine whether my path is the one which will lead me to that goal. And therefore the discussion. Even the likes and dislikes of people depend on their personality, their faith. The type of food I like depends on which mood my mind is in.\n\nSo when I'm in a sattvic mode, the type of food I like will be what we discussed. Sighnaha rasaha, that which promotes health. When I'm in rajasik mood, something which tastes good and when I'm tamasik mood, whatever is available now, this mood continues to change in our day to day life. Also, at times I would love to listen to Jagjit Singh's ghazal. But there are times I shut him off -- this is not the time.\n\nI'm sometimes driving for like a couple of hours. You normally think that I'll be putting Jagjit Singh ghazal or two hours. I never listen to it. I want to listen to Bloomberg or CNBC or something which keeps my mind alert about this world. Because I'm not in a mood of listening to music. So mood of my mind determines what I like and dislike.\n\nThis mood continues to change. But my goal is to make sure the predominance of my mind is in the one or the other which I am currently convinced that which gives me the liberation from my sorrow. And therefore this elaborate discussion about these three faiths: aphalakankshi bhih yajnaha. We have seen what they worship, what types of likes and dislikes they have and therefore what they receive, the ahara, what they eat, what they receive through their senses. Type of music I like. All that is depending on the mood of my mind.\n\nSo now it says what type of yajna, the actions. Yajna basically is a sacrifice. When we sacrifice something we are offering to someone. Every action of mine in this world is my Yajna, my offering to this world. But whether I'm offering with expectations or no expectations is what makes that action either a yajna or a normal action.\n\nSo Aphalakankshi bhih Yajnah Vidhidrishtah ya ijyate Yastavyam eveti manah samadhaya sa Sattvikah. That yajna or sacrifice which is offered without desire for fruits and performed as per the ordinance -- in other words, done methodically. I can do something haphazardly or I can do something methodically. Both will have different results. You know, when I first went to architecture school, the first thing they teach you -- well, they don't teach you, actually, you have to learn on your own.\n\nIn those days we used to have drawing boards. You put a paper on it and then you have T-squares and set squares -- those of you in engineering understand. For the first two months, I never understood how to do that, because nobody ever tells you how to align this paper. So you haphazardly start something and it never really comes out right. One day I had to ask my seniors. One of my friends, who was a senior student -- I said: you know, Gupta, this never comes out right. All my borders are always off.\n\nHe said: Neil, let me tell you how to do it. First thing, you set your board correctly. Then make sure your seat is comfortable so you can reach everything. Then align your paper to your T-square, not to your board. And that was like an eye-opener to me -- oh, that's why his drawing comes out better than mine.\n\nBecause when I was putting the effort before, without Vidhi Purvakam, I had never tried to find out what is the right method, or at least had no knowledge of it. Once I found out the right method, then I realized why it is so important. Before you start, make sure everything is correct -- drawing board is stable, my seat is stable, nothing is falling apart, everything is aligned. Now things work out much better than before.\n\nSo Bhagavan said, one who is doing Vidhi Purvakam -- Vidhi Drishtah, Yastavyam Eveti Manah Samadhaya Sa Sattvikah -- with the firm faith that sacrifice is a duty. Why am I doing it? Because we always say: well, if I don't have any desire for fruits, then there is no motivation -- why would I be doing anything? If I say you go to work but there is no expectation for a paycheck at the end of the month, what is the motivation? Bhagavan said, it's the other way around. The paycheck should be the byproduct of your actions, and you have to be absolutely certain it will be there, because you have faith in the law of karma.\n\nThe law of karma says your actions will be rewarded appropriately. One of the persons I interviewed long, long, long time ago when I was in Nairobi -- I would never forget him. I never hired him, but I still never forget him. I asked him: what salary do you expect? And he said: whatever you think is appropriate is good for me. And then he added: I believe that whatever I'm worth, I'll get paid, whether by this employer or the next one.\n\nYou may underpay me today, but my next employer will recognize my worth and will pay me for it. I will never forget him. A complete faith in his ability, and that his worth will be paid for. Bhagavan said, if you have that faith then only motivation you have to do your work is that this is my duty. That duty boundness is your motivation. I am a human being and therefore this is my duty. I'm a part of this community, therefore this is my duty.\n\nI'm part of this nation as a citizen. Therefore this is my duty. You take a role upon yourself and then see what your duty is and see whether you're performing those duties. And all your actions, because of the role you've taken, now motivate you to perform them. When you become a father, when you become a mother -- previously you were just a guy.\n\nNow you are a husband and then you are a father. Your duties continue to evolve and see whether you are motivated by those additional duties which you have taken upon yourself by taking this role. Bhagavan says the one who is performing these Yajnas in this world, performing sacrifices, offering their actions -- first of all, no predetermined expectation for the results. The results will be there. If I put actions, results will be there.\n\nBut what that would be I do not know. Because the results are always in future. Actions are always in present. Results are always in somebody's control. Because if I act in this world, the world will react. So it's in control of the world.\n\nActions are always in my control. With that understanding I will not dissipate my energy in worrying about the results but use all my energy into my actions. Therefore my actions will be better. And therefore my results will be better. I have figured out my duty is this and also took some guidance. Therefore, you become the first-time mom -- all those books, and then you take seminars. That's why I'm so fascinated. When my son Neeraj was born, I was completely unprepared for everything. When he was born I was working in my office because my father in law called me and said I think they had taken Meena to whatever the room. You can come as quickly as you can. I took no hurry part very seriously.\n\nSo by the time I reached there, he was already born. If you take guidance, then you will do things right. And obviously Meena never let me forget that, even today. So that is the result of my lack of Vidhi Purvakam. And then with a complete faith that this is what I want to do because this is my duty. And see such an action is satvikaha.\n\nSuch a yajna is Sattvic Yajna. All my actions -- if I define and say Aphalakankshi, in other words no predetermined result -- I have decided: I go for an interview, and all the time I remember my job is to just go and present myself. Whether they select me or not is their problem. So I come back and Jackie asks: so how was the interview? The interview is always good -- it is the result you have to worry about.\n\nSo aphalakankshi, vidhi drishta -- sattvic actions and yajnas are like that. Don't have any expectations. Do it because that's your duty and then be firm that that's what you want to do. Abhisandhaya tu phalam -- the next verse contrasts with this. In the first one we are doing it simply because it is my duty. I don't have a predetermined notion of what results will be, and I'm firmly established in that action.\n\nAbhisandhaya tu Phalam -- the next one is similar but with a slight difference. In the first one, I had no expectations. Here, I want to make sure that if I do this, I want to get this thing out of it. Before I make a donation, I ask: what kind of recognition will your organization give me? Can I get a seat on your board, or what other things are you going to do for us? Any action where I want to have a predetermined result -- that is Abhisandhaya tu Phalam. Dambhartham api cha eva yat -- I'm doing it because I want to show off. Let me give a concert where I'm going to show off how good a singer I am.\n\nIjjyatai Bharata Sreshta Vidhirajasam There are only two motivation I have in performing these actions. One is I want to show off and acquire something which is predetermined. Therefore that motivates me.",
      "reflection": "These verses complete the teaching on food and introduce the three types of yajna (sacrifice or action). Tamasic food is described as \"yatayamam gatarasam puti paryusitam\" - stale, tasteless, putrid, and leftover - reflecting a careless, inert approach to life. But the heart of this section lies in understanding sattvic versus rajasic action. The sattvic yajna is performed \"aphalakankibhih\" (without desire for fruits), following proper method (vidhi-drsta), with the firm conviction that \"this is my duty\" (yastavyam eva). The rajasic yajna, by contrast, is performed \"abhisandhaya tu phalam dambhartham\" - with expectation of results and for the sake of showing off.\n\nReflect on your motivations at work and in service. When you take on a project, do you first calculate \"what's in it for me?\" (rajasic) or do you recognize it as your duty and trust that appropriate results will follow (sattvic)? Krishna's teaching here connects to the law of karma: if you have faith that your worth will be recognized - if not by this employer, then by another - you can focus entirely on excellence rather than anxiety about rewards. This week, choose one task and approach it purely as duty, without mental bargaining about recognition or reward. Notice how this shifts your energy and the quality of your work. Ask yourself: \"Am I performing this action to show off my abilities, or because it genuinely needs to be done?\""

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 17, Shraddha Traya Vibhaga Yoga, three types of sraddhas. Culturally we are obsessed with classifications, so we classify everything. In this case, Arjuna asked the question: if somebody does not have any guidance from the Sastras -- either voluntarily rejected or not available -- but he still has faith and is working, propelled by his faith, what type of faith is that? Bhagavan says: as the man, so is his faith; also, as the faith, so is the man. Both have a very synergistic relationship.\n\nMy faith and who I am are basically very closely related to each other. And therefore this chapter is all about explaining the types of faith one can develop. If I have a goal to be one type of a person or other, I should examine what type of faith do I have? Or I should at least see that what type of faith will lead me to the goal which I want to achieve. So therefore the whole discussion about the three types of faith, and obviously it was quite anticipated after learning 16 chapters of Bhagavad Gita, that these three types of faith correspond with the three qualities of Maya, Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. Everything can be the Sattvik, Rajasik or Tamasic.\n\nOnce again we have to remember that nothing we have discussed ever said that one quality can be exclusive of other two. The one quality always comes with the little shades of the other two. But it is the predominance of my personality or my faith makes me who I am. The worship people do are also depending on their faith. Sattvicas will worship the Devas -- in other words, to get the illumination of their mind. They want the light of knowledge in their internal instruments. The Rajasic wants to achieve wealth, prosperity, something they think will give them infinite happiness. But we know it is transitory.\n\nThe goal is the same for all of us: liberation from our sorrows and unhappiness. We should examine whether my path is the one which will lead me to that goal. And therefore the discussion. Even the likes and dislikes of people depend on their personality, their faith. The type of food I like depends on which mood my mind is in.\n\nSo when I'm in a sattvic mode, the type of food I like will be what we discussed. Sighnaha rasaha, that which promotes health. When I'm in rajasik mood, something which tastes good and when I'm tamasik mood, whatever is available now, this mood continues to change in our day to day life. Also, at times I would love to listen to Jagjit Singh's ghazal. But there are times I shut him off -- this is not the time.\n\nI'm sometimes driving for like a couple of hours. You normally think that I'll be putting Jagjit Singh ghazal or two hours. I never listen to it. I want to listen to Bloomberg or CNBC or something which keeps my mind alert about this world. Because I'm not in a mood of listening to music. So mood of my mind determines what I like and dislike.\n\nThis mood continues to change. But my goal is to make sure the predominance of my mind is in the one or the other which I am currently convinced that which gives me the liberation from my sorrow. And therefore this elaborate discussion about these three faiths: aphalakankshi bhih yajnaha. We have seen what they worship, what types of likes and dislikes they have and therefore what they receive, the ahara, what they eat, what they receive through their senses. Type of music I like. All that is depending on the mood of my mind.\n\nSo now it says what type of yajna, the actions. Yajna basically is a sacrifice. When we sacrifice something we are offering to someone. Every action of mine in this world is my Yajna, my offering to this world. But whether I'm offering with expectations or no expectations is what makes that action either a yajna or a normal action.\n\nSo Aphalakankshi bhih Yajnah Vidhidrishtah ya ijyate Yastavyam eveti manah samadhaya sa Sattvikah. That yajna or sacrifice which is offered without desire for fruits and performed as per the ordinance -- in other words, done methodically. I can do something haphazardly or I can do something methodically. Both will have different results. You know, when I first went to architecture school, the first thing they teach you -- well, they don't teach you, actually, you have to learn on your own.\n\nIn those days we used to have drawing boards.

Then align your paper to your T-square, not to your board. And that was like an eye-opener to me -- oh, that's why his drawing comes out better than mine.\n\nBecause when I was putting the effort before, without Vidhi Purvakam, I had never tried to find out what is the right method, or at least had no knowledge of it. Once I found out the right method, then I realized why it is so important. Before you start, make sure everything is correct -- drawing board is stable, my seat is stable, nothing is falling apart, everything is aligned. Now things work out much better than before.\n\nSo Bhagavan said, one who is doing Vidhi Purvakam -- Vidhi Drishtah, Yastavyam Eveti Manah Samadhaya Sa Sattvikah -- with the firm faith that sacrifice is a duty. Why am I doing it? Because we always say: well, if I don't have any desire for fruits, then there is no motivation -- why would I be doing anything? If I say you go to work but there is no expectation for a paycheck at the end of the month, what is the motivation? Bhagavan said, it's the other way around.

And obviously Meena never let me forget that, even today. So that is the result of my lack of Vidhi Purvakam. And then with a complete faith that this is what I want to do because this is my duty. And see such an action is satvikaha.\n\nSuch a yajna is Sattvic Yajna. All my actions -- if I define and say Aphalakankshi, in other words no predetermined result -- I have decided: I go for an interview, and all the time I remember my job is to just go and present myself. Whether they select me or not is their problem. So I come back and Jackie asks: so how was the interview?

One is I want to show off and acquire something which is predetermined. Therefore that motivates me.",
      "reflection": "These verses describe tamasic sacrifice and introduce the beautiful teaching on threefold tapas (austerity). Tamasic yajna is \"vidhihinam\" (without proper method), \"mantrahinam\" (without sacred intention), \"adaksinam\" (without appropriate offering), and most importantly, \"shraddha-virahitam\" (devoid of faith) - it is mere ritual going through the motions. But then Krishna reveals three levels of genuine tapas: physical (sharira tapa) includes worship of the Divine, respect for teachers and the wise, purity, straightforwardness, celibacy, and non-violence. Verbal tapas (vak tapa) is speech that is \"anudvegakaram\" (non-agitating), true, pleasant, beneficial, and includes study of scriptures.\n\nThe teaching on speech is particularly practical: your words should be truthful AND pleasant AND beneficial - not just one or two of these qualities. Many pride themselves on \"brutal honesty\" while causing harm, or speak sweetly but without truth. This week, before speaking, especially in difficult conversations, pause and ask: \"Is what I am about to say true? Is it pleasant (or at least not agitating)? Is it beneficial to the listener?\" Practice the discipline of svadhyaya (self-study) by reading even a few verses of sacred text daily. Also examine your physical tapas: Do you show genuine respect to teachers and elders, or is it merely formal? Is there violence in your actions, even subtle forms like impatience or carelessness with others' time and feelings?"

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 17, Shraddha Vibhaga Yoga, three types of Shraddha. We are coming to the concluding portion of the Bhagavad Gita, and some of us who started from chapter one and have gone through all 16 chapters may start wondering: what about the people who never get a chance to learn the Bhagavad Gita? We are fortunate that we get a chance to learn the Bhagavad Gita one way or another. But what about the people who never thought about learning it or never had a chance? The thought does come to our mind: how do they live their life in a manner which is appropriate? A similar question Arjuna asked in the beginning of this chapter.\n\nArjuna says: I learned from you all this knowledge which you have given me, and I have Shraddha. But how about the people who have never gone through the scriptures or had the guidance from the scriptures? They also have Shraddha -- everyone has Shraddha in something, that we know. So how is their Shraddha helping them, or how do you classify their Shraddha? What kind of Shraddha is that, without any basis or guidance from any guru or scriptures?\n\nAnd Bhagavan said each person has a Shraddha according to his or her mental makeup. It as simple as that. Whatever my mental makeup is that will decide what type of things I will be convinced will give me happiness. Bhavan said that there are three types of Shraddha you find in people. One is Sattvik, other is Rajasic, third is Tamasic depending on the texture of the person's mind. We know that texture of our mind changes as the circumstances change.\n\nSo depending on my circumstances and the basic nature of my mind, my mind will be either in a Sattvic mode or in a Rajasic mode or a Tamasic mode. But with practice I can control mood of my mind. Even when these circumstances are not conducive, Bhagavan said, that becomes your predominant nature. Some people, no matter what it is, get angry. Some people, no matter what situation has come, enter the room and people will be all agitated. But that is because that is your basic nature.\n\nYour basic nature is what is predominantly the life you are living and how you are reacting to the situations. And that makes up your mental texture. And as your mental texture, so is your faith. And as your faith, so will be your mental texture. So we'll go back and forth between who I am, what I have faith in, what my faith in what make me who I am. So what are the three types of Shraddha?\n\nAnd this Shraddha is so powerful that it will lead your life. It will guide your life. Wherever I have my conviction that this is right. This is what will give me happiness. It will pursue that path. So our life is not really divided.\n\nWhat I do in one aspect of my life does not affect the other aspect of my life. Even though we think, well, I compartmentalize my life -- my professional life is different from my personal life -- in reality there is nothing like that. Who you are will permeate through the entire life that you live, whether it is personal, professional, social, or sacred.\n\nSo Bhagawan said that that's very important. That you control the texture of your mind. Because that will exhibit your qualities no matter what you are doing. And therefore he said that even to something as simple as Ahar food also you will pursue according to the mental makeup of yours. So in the beginning we had talked about three types of people. What type of food they will like.\n\nThat is, something which will give nourishment, is life-giving, promotes health. When you're Rajasic, you will like something which is tasty, feel-good food, comfort food. As soon as the word \"comfort\" comes, you know it's not really healthy. There is a restaurant in downtown that specializes in comfort food. I finally realized it's all loaded with calories.\n\nThat's why it's good. I don't know why Bhagavan made it that way -- why can't comfort food be healthy? I always question why fried food is not the healthiest food. So up till now people have been saying low-fat milk, skim milk, low fat.\n\nI just read article in New York Times said the whole milk is now rising in popularity. Because now the research says the whole milk is actually healthier than your skim milk. Still he said the American association, whatever the doctors recommend that you should have the low calorie diet. But the low calorie diet is gradually losing its glitter. So Bhagavan said that the person with Sattvic mood will find something which is nourishing and health giving. Rajesh will find something which tastes good and comfort food and it's a tamasic.\n\nWill get anything that is available. Does not matter whether it is good or bad. Then we said even the Yajna they perform in a broader sense. All my efforts are basically offered in the Yajna of my life. My life is a Yajna and I am offering all my efforts into it to achieve something good. Bhagawan saying the Yajna is for the greater good.\n\nEven when I consider that I'm doing something for the greater good it will be all as per my mental makeup. Even though I may have good intentions, I may end up doing something which may not be helpful to others. The road to hell is paved with good intentions -- I think the Rolling Stones or somebody said that. So sometimes, even though I have good intentions, my mental makeup will make me put efforts in a place where I feel right. They may not be right.\n\nTherefore he says the Sattvik will put efforts where it is. He has figured out what is the right way to put actions. With faith, with guidance that he will put his effort. When I buy furniture, I'm so impatient. Let's not worry about the instructions. Let's start putting it together.\n\nHalfway I realize that I missed a couple of steps. I have to go back and undo it. Bhagavan said the sattvic person will find out the right way to do it first. Whatever he does, he'll follow the proper method. A rajasic person will say let's get it done. Right or wrong, let's just get it done.\n\nBecause I want a result instantaneously -- that which gives me a result instantaneously, that's what I want to do. You don't have patience to go through this step by step, or Vidhi Purvakam. So because we want instantaneous results, I sing a song and people who are just like me, who don't know what music is, say: great, you are doing very well. That's what I was looking for.\n\nSo that's Rajasic Yajna -- without any method but with a result, a fruit, in mind. And then the last one we have seen: Yajna where I don't even have faith in it, but it's supposed to be done as per society's norm, or people think I'm not doing right, so let's do it anyway. It's like a factor of safety before an exam -- go to the temple. I know that's not really going to help, but you might as well do it because there is no harm. Just as a factor of safety, maybe let's go to the temple and say: Bhagavan, take care, tomorrow I have an exam. Without faith, without any method, without any reason -- that Yajna, Bhagavan says, is Tamasic Yajna.\n\nThen we came to the Tapas.\n\nThis faith affects ahara, yajna, tapa, and dana. So now we came to the Tapas part. Tapas, austerities, or as we loosely translate it, the disciplines which we follow. We discipline ourselves so that we can get some benefit out of it. We exercise routinely for our good health. I want to run a marathon -- I have to prepare myself.\n\nSo when we started this discussion, Bhagavan described three types of Tapas. First is at the physical level, next is Tapas at the speech level, and third is Tapas at the mental level, the thoughts level. So at the physical level:\n\nIn my activities, Bhagavan described worship of the Devas, Dwijah, Prajnah, and Guru -- deities, divine beings, twice born, wise people, and your guru. Ahimsa and Shaucham are considered Sharira Tapas. All of us, at some level or other, try to do that in our activities.\n\nNext, speech: whatever I speak is non-agitating to others, it is truth but sweet-sounding truth, and it is beneficial to others. That's Tapas at the speech level.\n\nAnd then Tapas at the mind level, where my mind is silent and not creating unnecessary noise in the background. At the thought level, my thoughts are disciplined. My thoughts are always about my highest goal, which is to achieve that oneness with God, as we call it. But in reality, what we are looking for is unbroken happiness.\n\nWhen I achieve a state where my happiness remains permanent -- it's not temporary, it's not coming and going -- Bhagavan said that's at the thought level. We know that most of us try at the physical level. The majority of people will fall into a category where they are trying their Tapas at the actions level. Where we fail is at the speech level, because we think that saying something is not hurting anybody.\n\nI'm Ahimsa-minded, but I say things that will hurt other people. \"I'm not hitting him, I'm not hurting him -- I'm just saying things.\" We hear this in the media all the time these days. But Bhagavan said that's also very harmful, and therefore very important to watch. So the majority will stop at the physical level of Tapas in actions, but fail to do it at the speech level.\n\nThen out of the remaining, there are few who try hard to be at the speech level, but most of us fail at the thought level. Because I think nobody knows what I'm thinking. Nobody has any clue what I'm thinking. Only my outward actions and my speech are the things people are noticing or judging me from. Most of our lives we're doing things for others to judge us by, right? That's why I said all marketing works very well.\n\nBecause all these people in marketing psychology figured out we never think about what this will look on me. We're only thinking about what it looks on others. So when we look at Tom Cruise wearing a suit which looks good on him, so I think it looks good on him, it should look good on me. So we try to judge ourselves by reflecting in the mirror of the society. And we think that what I am thinking in my mind nobody knows. And therefore we fail to do Tapas at the thought level.\n\nBut Bhagavan said all three, when performed together, will yield the good results. So the next verse says: Shraddhaya Paraya Taptam Tapah Trividham Naraihi Aphalakankshi Bhih Yuktaihi Sattvikam Parichakshate. A man with firm devotion -- Shraddhaya Paraya -- with firm faith, when a person is practicing all these three Tapas -- Trividham, all three -- and Aphalakankshi, he has no particular gain in mind. When I'm doing Tapas also, I shouldn't be expecting a particular result, because I must have complete faith in the Karma Phaladata -- that if I put my efforts, the results will be there.\n\nSo I constantly hear from my staff: Neil, I don't think that when we come on Sunday and work, anybody is appreciating it. I said, but I don't even know that you came on Sunday. Did you put down your timesheet that you were here on Sunday?",
      "reflection": "These verses complete the teaching on tapas by introducing the most subtle and important level: mental austerity (manasa tapa). Krishna describes it as \"manah prasadah\" (serenity of mind), \"saumyatvam\" (gentleness), \"maunam\" (silence or contemplation), \"atma-vinigrahah\" (self-control), and \"bhava-samsuddhih\" (purity of intention). This is the deepest discipline because, as Krishna notes, most people may discipline their actions and even their speech, but fail at the level of thought - believing that \"no one knows what I'm thinking.\" Yet inner noise eventually corrupts both speech and action. Sattvic tapas is performed with supreme faith, without desire for reward; rajasic tapas is done for \"satkaramana-pujartham\" - for honor, respect, and praise - and its results are \"chalam adhruvam\" (unstable and temporary).\n\nThis week, practice the discipline of mental silence. Set aside even five minutes daily to simply observe your thoughts without engaging them. Notice: Is your mind predominantly serene or agitated? When you perform good actions, is there a hidden desire for recognition? The teaching reveals that rajasic tapas - discipline performed for applause - yields only temporary, unstable results. Ask yourself honestly: \"Would I still practice this discipline if no one ever knew about it?\" Also examine bhava-samsuddhih (purity of intention): even if your actions appear sattvic and your speech is controlled, what is the quality of your underlying motivation? True mental austerity means your inner world matches your outer presentation."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 17, Sadhatraya Vibhaga yoga, yoga of three types of faiths. We had been learning in Bhagavad Gita that our goal in life is to find ultimate happiness. And one thing we have noticed in our life is that I only can feel happy when my mind is happy. So the goal is to keep this mind in a happy mode. And for that I have to purify my mind, purify my mind and intellect, which is an internal instrument to achieve the ultimate goal of liberation, liberation from my limitations. Right now, the limitations which I have create sorrows and anxieties and regrets.\n\nSo to become ultimately happy, I need to get out of my limitations. These limitations exist right now because of my identification with this body, mind, and intellect. Mind is the tool I use to decide whether I am happy or unhappy. So my first goal is to purify my mind, so it remains in a happy mode -- the Mana Prasadah.\n\nSo we have seen in this chapter that as my mind, so is my personality, my faith. Bhagavan said that there is someone who has no guidance from the scriptures or from a guru, or from any wise person. But each one of us has faith that I will achieve happiness one way or other. And then wherever my faith is that my happiness lies, those are the pursuit I'll pursue. So Arjuna asked Bhagavan, what kind of a faith is that? Bhagavan said, this faith can be of three different kinds.\n\nThis faith can be Sattvic, Rajasic, or Tamasic. Depending on your mind being Sattvic, Rajasic, or Tamasic, you will be convinced your happiness lies in those types of endeavors. So Bhagavan said: your faith, your mental texture -- as the faith, so is the person; as the person, so is the faith. It is very important for me to understand what is making me unhappy, what makes my mind unhappy. And therefore this chapter helps us understand how Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas affect my life.\n\nSo the first thing we have seen: Bhagavan said that everything you do in life will be controlled by your mental makeup -- the type of food you like, the type of food you will take, the yajnas which you perform, all the effort you put for the greater good.\n\nBut that greater good also include myself. So therefore, all my actions which I perform are basically to achieve their ultimate goal of becoming happy. So those actions which I offer as my sacrifice to get my happiness is my yajna. See, those yajnas will be also of three different types. Sattvik, rajasik and tamasic. So we have seen that the ahara, the sattvik people will eat what is good for them.\n\nAnd nutritious. Rajasic people will eat whatever is pleasant, whatever feels good. And Tamasic will take whatever is available. Yajnas -- Sattvic people will perform without any expectations for the fruits; the Rajasic will have a goal in mind, what they want to get out of these efforts; and the Tamasic just doesn't care. Then we talked about tapas, austerities -- but in our life we call it discipline.\n\nI have to discipline myself to do this. I was just reading this morning. Now, the new research says that not doing exercise is as bad as smoking cigarettes every day. I better be careful because I'm the one who obviously does not get motivated for exercise that easily. So now I say, oh, I need to exercise. That's something I'm telling myself.\n\nI need to perform to be in a good shape. I want to be in good shape because I want to be healthy. I want to be healthy because that makes me happy. So ultimately, all the tapas which we do, all the disciplines which we practice, are for my happiness. Bhagavan said Tapas is performed at three different levels: you perform at your physical level in your actions, you perform at your speech level,\n\nAnd you perform at the mental level. So the actions level, My actions should be helping others and not harming others. All my activities, I keep in mind that my actions are for the greater good. Once I take care of the greater good, I am already included in it. Because any action performed by any one person in this universe affects the entire universe. We know that we are all connected with each other.\n\nIf one person in family is unhappy, it makes the whole family unhappy. So we know that that why I should be performing this for greater good. Because it ultimately will affect me if someone is suffering. That suffering will eventually come down to me. The bhagavan said that the tapas are performed at three different levels. My activities should be such that it is for the greater good, then at the speech level, my speech should be such that it is truth but pleasant sounding truth.\n\nAll we husbands have a good idea of this. When your wife says, how do I look -- do you really want to be truthful? You can be truthful, but it has to be pleasant-sounding. Satyam Vada, Priyam Vada. Bhagavan said your speech should be not only truthful and pleasant, but also beneficial.\n\nIf I tell somebody a truth, it has to be for his or her benefit, not just because I want to be Satya Vadi Harishchandra. So that's at the speech level. And then at the mental level -- I may be acting in a manner that looks so Sattvic, I may be speaking so softly and nicely, but if there is noise in my mind which is completely different from my actions and my speech, it will eventually affect my speech and my actions. Therefore, at the mental level, this tapas is what Bhagavan is describing.\n\nNow when I'm performing, it can also be the same three categories of Sattvik, rajasic and tamasic. Again, my tapas is for not for getting anything out of it, but it is something I need to do. So that's the purification of your internal instrument. My tapas is to purify my internal instrument so that I can experience that happiness in my mind. And the last thing we are seeing is the Dana. Charity is our general idea is it is to help others.\n\nIn reality, charity is to help yourself. Therefore, Swami Vivekananda said: if you find somebody who is worthy of helping, when you help, thank him for giving you the opportunity to help -- so that you can help yourself. Dhanam is for me to purify my mind and control my ego. Dana gives me the opportunity to purify my mind by giving away things which are in abundance with me. Dana is also a social phenomenon to keep the equilibrium in society. We know that in any given society there will be income inequality.\n\nPeople are not born with the same resources and therefore there will be inequality. And if I happen to be the one who is fortunate enough to have more than what I need, it becomes my duty and it becomes my means to purify my mind by doing charities. So charities are strictly for me and not for others. So when the I perform charities, I must be very clear why I'm performing these charities. So there Bhagavan said that these charities can be seen as three types. Again, Sattvik Rajasik or Tamarsic.\n\nThe first one says Datavyam. The very first requirement for appropriate Sattvic Dana, which will give you the most result of what you're looking for. What you're looking for in your life is to purify your mind to a point that it is always in a sunny, bright mood and you're always happy. You do not want to be grouchy and unhappy, complaining and regretful. So to keep my mind in that mode, I'm performing all of this -- I'm eating the right food, doing the right yajna, doing the right tapas.\n\nWhen I do also, I have to keep in mind I'm doing it for me and therefore I should know how to make these charities. So the first requirement is Datavyam Iti -- I see a cause and realize there is no other way but for me to help. You are going on a road and you see a little child just about to get hit by a car. You don't sit down and say: is this going to be a Sattvic act or Rajasic? Is it going to be Tamasic?\n\nAt that point you have no other thought than I need to help that child get him or her out of the harm's way. So when you do a charity and you have that attitude, it has to be done, it has to be done then that's the right charity. And when you give, you are not obliging that person -- actually, you should thank him: you are obliging me by giving me a chance. If there's no one to help, who are you going to help? When we were at the old temple, we were having this annadhanam, because every Sunday people would come there. But if you are feeding people who are already fed, that is not Annadhanam -- it is just a party you are having.\n\nEvery week we all get together. When a person needs food and you give him food, that's Annadhanam. If a person is already fed, you can't give him food and call it charity. Deshe kale cha patre cha ta danam sattvikam smrutam -- when it is given at the right time, at the right place, to the right person.\n\nSo if I want to help somebody and that person is sitting in a group of his friends, and I go and say: you told me that you need help --\n\nHere is my hundred dollars which you asked for. You are insulting him in front of his friends and family. He didn't want other people to know his problems. He came to you to ask for help, and now you're helping him at the wrong place. Wrong place, wrong time.\n\nYou should also not help somebody who you know does not need any help. Sometimes people say: I don't get a chance to do all this social work. I want to do social work, but people are not making me president of this organization. You shouldn't worry about it. Bhagavan says Patra -- only help someone who really needs help and is seeking help.\n\nWhen you find that opportunity, take that opportunity that is God's given to you. Consider that as God's blessing that you came across this opportunity to help that person and therefore you're helping. Bhagawan says that's a Sattvik dharam. You're not expecting anything out of it. Just like the example of a child in a harm's way. When you help that child you're not expecting anything, not even thank you from anybody.\n\nAt that point your only thought is I need to get that child out of the harm's way. It's the exact same emotion you should have when you give somebody any help: that person needs help, and I have the means -- I need to help that person. Bhagavan says that's Sattvic Dana.\n\nYatu pratyupakarartham phalam uddishya va punah diyate pariklistam tadanam rajasam smrutam. In contrast to that, the gift which is given in view of receiving something in return -- phalam uddishya. I'll make this donation so I can get this tax benefit.\n\nAnd at least people will think that he is a good donor. I am doing these charities so it will help my business. So all companies say \"we are connected, we give back\" -- all that is actually just marketing.",
      "reflection": "These verses describe tamasic tapas and introduce the profound teaching on dana (charity). Tamasic austerity is performed \"mudha-grahena\" (with foolish stubbornness), involving self-torture or harming others - discipline without wisdom or proper understanding. But the verses on dana reveal a transformative truth: sattvic giving is \"datavyam iti\" - done with the conviction that \"this must be given,\" to one who cannot reciprocate (anupakarine), at the right place, time, and to the right recipient. Rajasic giving, by contrast, is \"pratyupakarartham\" (expecting something in return) or \"pariklistam\" (given grudgingly). Swami Vivekananda captured this beautifully: when you find someone worthy of help, thank them for giving you the opportunity to purify your own mind.\n\nReflect deeply on your relationship with giving. When you donate or help someone, do you calculate the tax benefit or social recognition? Do you give reluctantly, feeling the pinch? The sattvic giver experiences the spontaneous urgency of \"datavyam iti\" - like seeing a child about to be hit by a car, where helping is not a choice but an imperative. This week, practice giving with complete anonymity - help someone who cannot possibly repay you, without anyone knowing. Notice how this feels different from publicized charity. Also examine: Do you give at the right time and place (not embarrassing the recipient), to those who genuinely need help (not just those who can acknowledge you)? Remember, dana purifies the giver more than it helps the receiver."

Now, the new research says that not doing exercise is as bad as smoking cigarettes every day. I better be careful because I'm the one who obviously does not get motivated for exercise that easily. So now I say, oh, I need to exercise. That's something I'm telling myself.\n\nI need to perform to be in a good shape. I want to be in good shape because I want to be healthy. I want to be healthy because that makes me happy. So ultimately, all the tapas which we do, all the disciplines which we practice, are for my happiness. Bhagavan said Tapas is performed at three different levels: you perform at your physical level in your actions, you perform at your speech level,\n\nAnd you perform at the mental level. So the actions level, My actions should be helping others and not harming others. All my activities, I keep in mind that my actions are for the greater good. Once I take care of the greater good, I am already included in it. Because any action performed by any one person in this universe affects the entire universe.

Because it ultimately will affect me if someone is suffering. That suffering will eventually come down to me. The bhagavan said that the tapas are performed at three different levels. My activities should be such that it is for the greater good, then at the speech level, my speech should be such that it is truth but pleasant sounding truth.\n\nAll we husbands have a good idea of this. When your wife says, how do I look -- do you really want to be truthful? You can be truthful, but it has to be pleasant-sounding. Satyam Vada, Priyam Vada. Bhagavan said your speech should be not only truthful and pleasant, but also beneficial.\n\nIf I tell somebody a truth, it has to be for his or her benefit, not just because I want to be Satya Vadi Harishchandra. So that's at the speech level. And then at the mental level -- I may be acting in a manner that looks so Sattvic, I may be speaking so softly and nicely, but if there is noise in my mind which is completely different from my actions and my speech, it will eventually affect my speech and my actions. Therefore, at the mental level, this tapas is what Bhagavan is describing.\n\nNow when I'm performing, it can also be the same three categories of Sattvik, rajasic and tamasic. Again, my tapas is for not for getting anything out of it, but it is something I need to do. So that's the purification of your internal instrument. My tapas is to purify my internal instrument so that I can experience that happiness in my mind. And the last thing we are seeing is the Dana. Charity is our general idea is it is to help others.\n\nIn reality, charity is to help yourself. Therefore, Swami Vivekananda said: if you find somebody who is worthy of helping, when you help, thank him for giving you the opportunity to help -- so that you can help yourself.

In contrast to that, the gift which is given in view of receiving something in return -- phalam uddishya. I'll make this donation so I can get this tax benefit.\n\nAnd at least people will think that he is a good donor. I am doing these charities so it will help my business. So all companies say \"we are connected, we give back\" -- all that is actually just marketing.",
      "reflection": "These verses describe tamasic giving and introduce the sacred formula \"Om Tat Sat\" - the triple designation of the Eternal Spirit (Brahman). Tamasic dana is given \"adesha-kale\" (at the wrong place and time), \"apatrebhyah\" (to unworthy recipients), \"asatkrtam\" (without respect), and \"avajnatam\" (with contempt) - it demeans both giver and receiver. But then Krishna offers a powerful tool for transformation: \"Om Tat Sat\" - by which the Vedas, Brahmanas, and sacrifices were ordained from the beginning. Om represents the transcendental reality beyond all parts; those who understand the Spirit begin all acts of sacrifice, charity, and austerity by uttering Om, remembering that all manifestation is ultimately one.\n\nThe teaching of Om is profoundly practical. Even if your faith is currently rajasic or tamasic, beginning any action with the remembrance of Om - the ultimate unity behind all diversity - can gradually purify and transform that faith toward sattva. This week, experiment with this ancient practice: before beginning any significant action (work, conversation, meal, or practice), pause and silently invoke Om, remembering that you and all beings are manifestations of one reality. Notice how this shifts your relationship to the action and to others involved. Also examine your giving: Have you ever given in a way that embarrassed the recipient or showed contempt? True giving preserves dignity and arises from respect for the Divine in the other person."

And therefore this chapter elaborates what are the types of faiths a person can have? Then we have broadly classified, just as everything else, in three categories.\n\nFaith can be Sattvic, faith can be Rajasic, faith can be Tamasic, and depending on that, I may be a Sattvic person, a Rajasic person or a Tamasik person, and my understanding of that will help me how do I change my faith so that my thinking changes, so my behavior changes, my mind changes and ultimately gives me the result which I'm looking for, which is in the end is to achieve happiness. You're all looking for one and one thing alone is to get out of our limitations and sorrows. So Bhagavan has described in this chapter the three types of faith and how it controls our Ahara, our Yagna, our Tapa and our Dana. As we have seen last time, it is what we take from this world, how we interact and connect with this world, how we discipline ourselves for what we want and then what we give back to this world, all dependent on my faith. And therefore my goal obviously is to make my faith more Sattvic. If I detect that I have Tamasic faith, I want to make it more Rajasic.\n\nIf I detect I'm more Rajasya, make it Sattvik. Eventually I can get to my goal of achieving that happiness. So now our question was: well, I may or may not have that capability, and I may be all filled with Rajasic faith and not be able to change that. The last three verses we have seen say there is one way of mitigating that. There is a threefold indicator of that transcendental reality, the ultimate reality, the one unifying entity which binds us all, which is indicated in the Sastras as Om Tat Sat. Om is the transcendental form of the Lord that I have learned in the previous chapter. The Astadha Prakrithi, Eightfold manifest Prakriti of the Lord.\n\nSo everything which I see and perceive and feel is basically nothing but his manifestation. But then I come to the conclusion, maybe if I put everything together that's Lord, or if I put all the parts together, will it make a machine? The question is how you put it together. So all this part putting together does not still make the identity of the Lord. That is something beyond that. Lower Prakriti and higher Prakriti.\n\nI have all these parts and say if I put all this together, it will be the whole. No, it has to be in a particular manner. Then only that machine functions as it's supposed to be functioning. All these parts, I have to put it together and perceive it in a way that it will reveal the Lord's identity. And that's the transcendental part, is how to see this whole in a manner that I can see Him. I see this world in its parts, but I can't put it together as his identity.\n\nThat's the Aum, a transcendental part. Om is the indicator of that. And if I can remember that -- that all that I see, perceive, and experience put together -- I will never be able to fully understand the Lord through parts alone. But Om points to that reality beyond the parts. My faith may be rajasic, it may be even tamasic, but remembering Om will transform it into sattvic faith. That's basically a way out given to us by these last three verses.\n\nOm Tat Sat iti nirdeshah brahmanah trividhah smritah. These are the three indicators of that supreme reality. I know all the parts right now, but I can't put together the machine. I can't put together its real identity. So Aum is the one indicator. Tat we have seen is another indicator.\n\nThat is that that which I constantly keep referring to the God, the Lord, that entity other than this which I can perceive, feel, touch and vouch for it, that it exists. That which I cannot vouch for, that it exists, does exist, but beyond my perception. So that's Tat and Sat, the existence or the truth. Truth is that which exists in all periods of time. In other words, it was true yesterday, it is true today and it will be true tomorrow. That is Sat.\n\nSo these are the three indicators. And Bhagavan said that those who are Brahmavadina -- those who are completely convinced about the existence of that ultimate reality. Just like Mudivad (capitalism), Samajvad (socialism) -- because they're convinced that this is the only way to help the society. Vaad means I'm completely on the side of that.\n\nThose who are completely convinced that Brahman is the only reality -- they will start all their activities by uttering Om. Utterance means remembrance. It's an indication to me that Om is the ultimate reality. I may be perceiving a difference between you and me right now, and therefore I may have developed a liking or disliking for you.\n\nBut Om is the ultimate reality which manifests as me, which manifests as you. As long as I have that thought in the beginning, whatever I do afterwards will be purified. Om Iti Udahritya Yajna Dana Tapaha Kriyaha -- we have discussed all that in the previous verses. The activities we are performing in this world:\n\nWe receive from the world, we interact with the world, we connect with this world, we prepare ourselves for how to interact with the world, and then we give back to the world. First, those who are Brahmavadina.\n\nWe see that those who are seeking liberation have come to the conclusion that there is no way that in my present state of limitedness the ultimate goal of infinite happiness is possible. I have come to that clear understanding that no matter how hard I try with my mind and intellect and body that unbroken happiness is not possible at all. It's only possible if I can identify with that. That which is unlimited. That which has no limitations.\n\nThat which has no sorrows, that which has no competition, that which is all-pervading. People who are seeking moksha -- and we are all Moksha Kankshi, believe it or not -- we want liberation from anything which we think is our limitation.\n\nAll of us who are aware of our limitations and are not happy with them -- if you're happy with your limitations, you're not a Moksha Kankshi. If I have some limitations but think this is good enough, then I'm not seeking liberation. But we all have one limitation we cannot stand: running into a situation which makes me unhappy. Therefore I'm constantly trying to avoid the things which create sorrows and want to pursue the things which give me happiness.\n\nSo at least I want to get rid of the limitations that run me into situations which give me unhappiness. Bhagavan says those Moksha Kankshi who want to get rid of those limitations will start all their activities -- the same yajna, tapa, dana kriyaha -- with Tat. Tat anabhisandhaya phalam yajna tapah kriyaha. They have come to the conclusion that if I remember Him as the Karma Phaladata, He is the giver of the fruits. So I leave the results to Him and do all my activities, trusting that He will give me the result that will lead to liberation.\n\nWe have learned that as Karma Yoga. The last one: sad bhave sadhu bhave cha sad iti etat prayujyate, prashaste karmani tatha sat shabdah partha yujyate. Sat is used in the sense of reality. Sat, as we have said is only that can be proven true in all three phases. In the past, in the present, in the future. Everything else is unreal. It existed one point of time in time and space, another period of time.\n\nIt has no existence whatsoever. It's completely gone. Just like a film on a screen or a hologram. It exists in my perception for a period of time. So the lamp is shut off. The word sat is used in the sense of reality and also for goodness.\n\nNow we are coming back to the world which you and I know -- not transcendental unlimitedness, but the world of good and bad. Our world is divided by good and bad. Bhagavan said the real and the good is indicated in this world as Sat. As we say, there are values and there are universal values.\n\nThere are values may be applicable to me in this situation which may not be applicable in other situations. Well, those are transitory values. I work for a company and what are the values of the company? It only applies to me as long as I am there. But there are values which applies to me whether I'm working or not. Whether I'm working for this company or not or that company or not.\n\nThose are universal values. Therefore we have said even before the civilization started, human beings knew what is right and what is wrong. Even before any religious were established, they knew what is good and what is bad. Those universal good and those universal truths are indicated as Sat. It is not dependent on any culture, not dependent on any beliefs -- those are the universal good and universal reality. So Bhagavan said, the word Sat is used in this sense of reality and of goodness. And also, Partha:\n\nThe word is used in the sense of auspiciousness. Anything which is good is auspicious. And therefore you start that work, same thing, yajna pohadana kriya with that word sat. Then may this be auspicious. May this act of mine be of goodness and of kindness and of reality. So you start with sat.\n\nSo obviously in the Sikh tradition, the word Sat is given the most importance: Sat Sri Akal, that Sat which is Akal, which is timeless, no beginning, no end. So that Sat is uttered: yajne tapasi dane cha sthitih sat iti uchyate. Therefore, if I am one who is clearly aware of good and bad in this world -- I divide my world into this is good and this is evil, this is good for me, this is bad for me -- then I should start all my activities with Sat. Bhagavan says yajne tapasi dane cha -- the activities remaining the same.\n\nWhether it is my tamasic faith, my rajasic faith, or the sattvic faith, it is what my mind tells me is good, I'm gonna do. No matter how much I tell you this is good for you, as long as your mind does not tell you it is good, you will not be able to follow. Everybody says, do this. Okay, okay, I'll think about it. But the thinking part never comes, because I have already decided it is not worth thinking about. So Bhagavan said -- and that's what yajne tapasi dane cha sthitih means:\n\nTo be steadfast in my yajna, dana, and tapa. I do some yajnas, but only occasionally -- some sacrifice here and there. But occasionally I'm not steadfast. I sometimes get all excited and say, I think we should all do some charity or some kind of community service. We organize this, and then after about two weeks, everything gradually dies down.",
      "reflection": "These verses explain \"Tat\" and \"Sat\" - completing the sacred formula. \"Tat\" (That) is uttered by those seeking liberation (moksha-kankibhih) who perform yajna, tapas, and dana without attachment to results (anabhisandhaya phalam). They remember that the fruits belong to \"That\" - the Supreme, the Karma Phaladata (giver of fruits). \"Sat\" signifies reality, goodness, and auspiciousness - it represents universal truth that transcends all cultures and beliefs, the values that were known even before civilizations and religions were established. Krishna teaches that steadfastness (sthiti) in yajna, tapas, and dana is itself called Sat.\n\nThe distinction between Tat and Sat offers practical wisdom. Use \"Tat\" when you need to surrender the fruits of action - remembering that results belong to That which is beyond your control. Use \"Sat\" when you need grounding in universal goodness - what is true, beneficial, and auspicious regardless of circumstance. This week, when anxious about outcomes, silently invoke \"Tat\" to release attachment. When uncertain about whether an action is right, invoke \"Sat\" and ask: \"Is this aligned with universal truth and goodness?\" Also examine your steadfastness: Do you enthusiastically begin charitable projects only to abandon them after initial excitement fades? Sthiti (steadfastness) in your practices is itself a form of Sat. What one practice can you commit to maintaining with unwavering consistency?"

      "reflection": "This concluding verse delivers the chapter's most sobering message: \"Asraddhaya hutam dattam tapas taptam krtam ca yat, asad ity ucyate partha na ca tat pretya no iha\" - whatever is offered, given, or practiced WITHOUT FAITH is called \"Asat\" (unreal, the negation of Sat), and has no significance here or hereafter. This is not about the object of faith, but about the presence of faith itself. Actions performed mechanically, rituals gone through without conviction, charity given without heart - all are rendered meaningless. Faith (shraddha) is the essential ingredient that transforms ordinary action into spiritual practice.\n\nThis verse invites deep self-examination: How much of your daily life is performed with genuine faith versus mere habit or obligation? Do you pray with conviction or recite words mechanically? Do you work with purpose or simply go through the motions? The teaching is both challenging and liberating - it is not the elaborate nature of your practice that matters, but the quality of faith behind it. A simple act done with complete faith surpasses grand gestures performed without heart. This week, choose one small daily action - perhaps your morning routine, a work task, or a family interaction - and infuse it with conscious intention and faith. Ask yourself before beginning: \"Do I truly believe in the value of what I am about to do?\" If not, either find that faith or reconsider the action. Remember: shraddha is the foundation upon which all spiritual transformation is built."

      ],
      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 17 and we concluded chapter 17. Now we'll be starting chapter 18, Yoga of Liberation through Renunciation. This is the last chapter in Bhagavad Gita, basically a revision or summary. We are going to review all that we have discussed so far in Bhagavad Gita up to chapter 17. From chapter two through 17 -- chapter one was the introduction, setting the stage, telling us what situation we are in.\n\nWe are in Arjuna's situation. We face this battle of life and in that we come across situations which are not clear cut. So that was the scenario. And then Bhagavan gave us the whole discourse about why we are so confused. We are confused because of our basic fault -- as the Christians would call it, a basic sin -- or basic misconception about ourselves, about who we are. We consider this mortal being to be me, whereas the \"I\" that I truly am is imperishable.\n\nWe learnt that once you change that paradigm -- that this is not me. This body, mind and intellect is not me. The \"I\" that I truly am is the owner of this body, mind and intellect. This body, this mind, my intellect -- they are the equipment I use to transact with this world. The mortality is for the body, mind and intellect, particularly for the body. In this life, the body will survive from birth to death and then it will decay.\n\nBut the mind and intellect will continue their journey till they give up their own attachment and identification. So we have learned in the first six chapters that the basic technique for detaching oneself from this limited self and then attaching to the supreme self is Karma Yoga. We have seen that there are two aspects of Karma Yoga. One is doing actions without any expectations for the fruits, and the second is to act for the greater good. So these are the two main things we have learned. They equate to Tyaga and Sannyasa.\n\nSo we have heard these two words, Tyaga and Sannyasa, over and over again in this discourse. We constantly talk about giving up, abandonment -- and what to give up is what we have to learn. Chapter three said Karma Phala Tyaga is the Tyaga. What you need to give up is the expectations of a particular result from your actions. Then later chapters 4 and 5 talk about renouncing actions in knowledge. Right now I consider myself the doer and therefore I expect the results. Then I become the enjoyer and the sufferer.\n\nIf I give up the doership, then the sufferer and enjoyer also goes away. As long as I consider I am the doer, all the results are binding to me. Because I take the responsibility, I take the ownership of my actions. Then the results which comes in future. Actions are always in present. Results are always in future.\n\nNo matter what a time lag is. By the time I speak and you hear and you respond, there is a time lag. It may be a fraction of a second but there is always a time lag. So the actions are always in present, results are always in future. The future is one which I do not have a control over. I only have control of the present.\n\nI can only live in present. I can only act in present. So how do I make myself more efficient? In present is what we have learned in those chapters. Give up the expectations of the fruits. Because I do not have any control over what the fruits would be.\n\nI am not the judge of what the rewards of my action should be, even though I have expectations. Karma Phala Datta is always someone else. Whether we consider the Almighty or the world. I go for an interview for a project. All I can do is make presentation.\n\nThe result is always in the hand of the selection committee who I have no control over. But all I can do is make myself as efficient and proficient and effective as possible. The Bhagavan said, if you do not think about the results, you will be more efficient. You are not wasting your energy into thinking about what will come out of actions. Then when we talked about the second set of chapters where we have described the Bhagavan's identity, who the Bhagavan is. Then we say Bhagavan has two aspects.\n\nOne is Purusha, which is the substratum for all things and beings. What we call \"myself,\" you call \"yourself,\" he calls \"himself,\" she calls \"herself,\" it calls \"itself\" -- that Self is the Purusha, which is permeating through all things and beings as existence. And then there is the manifest aspect of the Prakriti which is the myriads of forms and names and colors. And it's constantly changing. We have come to learn that that's because of the Maya.\n\nThis Prakriti is the manifest world of plurality, is a product of Maya. Maya is that which is not, but appears to be that. In Newtonian physics, the atom looks so solid, but on further investigation, you found there is no solid material in atom at all. There is nothing that we have found so far which is solid in atom, but it does act as a very solid material. Therefore, I can punch this table. If I punch this table, it will hurt because it is very solid.\n\nThis, which appears to be real, but it is not, is the product of Maya. And this Maya has three gunas. As we have discussed, this Maya is supported by the three constituent parts, the Sattva, rajas and tamas. The purity, the reality, the truth; Rajas, which is the activity; and Tamas, which is inertia. To remain as an entity in space and time, inertia is needed -- it has to remain as it is for you and I to perceive it. Sattva, Rajas and Tamas are the three aspects which govern our life as part of the Prakriti.\n\nSo we have now five things we obviously have to focus on. Tyaga and Sannyasa are the means to achieve the ultimate happiness that I am seeking. And then, what is binding me to this world? This identification which I have with this body, mind, intellect is because of the three Gunas of Prakriti -- Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas. So this chapter combines all the concepts which we have learned in various chapters into one cohesive teaching on how one should use this knowledge to make your life better and achieve your final goal of liberating yourself from unhappiness and sorrows. Just as we have seen previously, Arjuna time and again asked questions to make sure that he understood correctly.\n\nIn chapter eight, he said, these are the following terms. You said Brahman, you said Dharma, you said Karma, you said Adhyatma, you said Adhi Devata. Explain to me all this in detail. Then we had this whole discussion in chapter eight. Now in this chapter, he starts with saying, let's make sure that I understood correctly that you use two terms, tyaga and sannyasa. They both seem the same thing. When somebody says, \"give up drinking coffee,\" and then I say, \"I renounce coffee\" -- both seem one and the same thing. I'm just not drinking coffee. There's got to be a difference. Otherwise you won't be talking about Tyaga and Sannyasa in two different contexts. So I would like to know. So the chapter starts with Arjuna saying Sanyasasya Mahabaho tattoom ichami veditum.\n\nI want to know about Sannyasa in its essence. And also I want to know about tyaga in its essence. I want to know what is Tyaga and what is Sannyasa. He addresses Krishna with two different Hrishikesha and Keshini Sudhana. Krishna has various names depending on how you see him. So one is Keshini Sudhana, the slayer of demon Keshini.\n\nSo for those who have read Mahabharata or Bhagavadpura, Keshani was a demon was sent to kill Krishna in the form of a horse and Krishna slayed him by splitting him into two. So one who basically separates ignorance from knowledge is Keshini Sudhana. He is also called Hrishikesha. Hrishikesha has several meanings. One is \"one who has control over the senses,\" the master of the senses.\n\nAnother meaning is \"one who has short hair.\" So Arjuna addresses him saying Krishna Hrushiki, explain to me what is the difference between Tyaga and Sannyasa so that I am not confused. He talked about giving up things and also renouncing things. If we reflect back, we have talked about how Tyaga is Karma Fala Tyaga, and giving up the sense of agency that I am the doer is Sannyasa. We discussed that previously in the Bhagavad Gita. But Krishna now answers it slightly differently and he says Sri Bhagavanu vacha kamyanam Karmanam Nyasam sanyasam kabayo viduhu Giving up desire prompted actions.\n\nKavi means sage or poet, in Gujarati and in many vernacular languages. So in Gujarati we say, where the sun cannot shine, the poet can take his imagination there. The Kavis in the Vedic time are the people who saw the truth and then put it in poetic language. In the Rig Vedas and Sama Vedas, those who had the vision of the truth are the Kavis.\n\nMany Kavis say that giving up desire prompted actions is sannyasa. Desire prompted actions only come in place if it is driven by my ego. If I think I am the doer and therefore I want something out of my action, so those actions are prompted by my self interest. By my ego are the desire prompted actions. So if I give up the sense of agency as the doer, there won't be any desire-prompted actions. All actions become for the greater good.\n\nAnd that's where we have the concepts of offering all the actions to the Lord. If I come to the conclusion, as we have learnt in Bhagavad Gita that all actions are performed by this body, mind and intellect and the qualities of the body, mind and intellect. Because, why am I not the biggest wrestler in town? It is because I don't have the equipment. I don't have the body to wrestle. Everything which I do in life is depending on what equipment I have.\n\nWhat is the proper apparatus I have? I like to sing because I have been given a voice which is appropriate for singing. If it was not, I would have no desire to sing. I don't have desire to dance. Because the apparatus is not right. So Bhagavan says that all actions are performed by the quality of your equipment and your senses, which are part of this Prakriti.\n\nBut I consider them to be my actions by misconception that this is me. If I correct that conception then all actions will not be for me. And therefore they will not be desire prompted. So he says Sannyasa is simply giving up the desire-prompted actions. Kamyanam Karmanam Nyasa Sarvakarma Falat Tyagam Prahuhu Tyagam Vichakshanah Vichakshanah. Wise people who have observed how this world works and how the actions are performed.\n\nAnd how the results of the actions are affected by our expectations. You see, those people have said Sarvakarma Falatyagam. Not some -- not just giving up the fruits for actions which are of no value. But for all the actions which I perform, I give up the expectation for the fruits. And we have discussed in detail in chapter three what is Karma Faladhyyagam. Karma Falat Yaga is simply not to expect a particular result.\n\nResult will come in the law of nature. Once I perform action, there will be a reaction. As in physics we say it will be equal and opposite.",
      "reflection": "Arjuna opens this final chapter with a profound question that resonates deeply with our daily struggles: What is the difference between tyaga (relinquishment) and sannyasa (renunciation)? Krishna's response reveals a liberating truth - sannyasa is giving up desire-prompted actions, while tyaga is surrendering the fruits of all actions. This distinction is crucial for modern life. We cannot abandon all actions, but we can transform our relationship with them. The key insight is that the Karma Phala Datta (giver of results) is always someone other than the doer. When we truly understand this, the anxiety about outcomes naturally dissolves.\n\nConsider today: What desire-prompted actions are you performing simply because your ego demands certain results? Can you identify one action where you are acting not from genuine duty but from the expectation of recognition, reward, or control over outcomes? The Gita suggests that even good actions bind us when we cling to their fruits. Practice this: Before your next significant action, pause and ask yourself - \"Am I doing this because it needs to be done, or because I want something specific from it?\" This simple inquiry begins the process of transforming ordinary work into a path of liberation.\n\nAs an exercise, choose one task today and perform it with complete attention but zero attachment to how it will be received or what it will produce. Notice the difference in your inner experience - the lightness that comes from acting without the burden of expectation."

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 18, Moksha Sannyasa Yoga, Yoga of Liberation through Renunciation. This is a constant theme in our discussion: that to enjoy something, you have to give up something. So all throughout Bhagavad Gita you hear these two words, Tyaga and Sannyasa. Our normal connotation is that if I give up something, I have lost something. But Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita constantly tell us, to gain something you have to give up something. You are giving up something because you want to gain something.\n\nWhen Upanishads like Isha Vasya Upanishad say \"Isha vasyam idam sarvam\" -- that this world is pervaded by that one single entity. Everything in this world, Jagatyam jagat, that which you see in this Jagat, is all pervaded by the same Ishvara, the same entity. Tena tyaktena bhunjita -- you protect that entity within you by detachment. If you attach to something else, you'll be detached from your own self.\n\nSo the main theme of Bhagavad Gita is that you should give up all attachments to enjoy the bliss which you're seeking. That perennial happiness that you're seeking can only be enjoyed by giving up the attachments to the world of plurality. So we have been discussing these two terms from chapter two onward -- Tyaga and Sannyasa. This chapter opened with Arjuna saying, I want to understand these two terms Tyaga and Sannyasa in detail so there is no confusion. What is Tyaga and what is Sannyasa?\n\nWe have talked about Tyaga and Sannyasa as if they're the same thing. Giving up something and renouncing something. I give up my Samsara or I renounce my Samsara. But as we discussed last time, giving up coffee is Tyaga. I will not drink coffee from tomorrow. That doesn't mean that my attachment to coffee is gone.\n\nI will have a lingering thought of coffee. Renouncing is completely detaching yourself from the thought of coffee. So that's renunciation. So Bhagavan explains here in very simple terms: Kamyanam Karmanam Nyasah Sanyasam Kavayo Vidhu. The sages who have realized the truth in their meditation and contemplation then give out that truth in poetry.\n\nIn the richas, in Vedas they are called kavis. Those who have written poetry. These sages have said that Karmanam Nyasam it is sannyasam. Giving up the desire prompted actions is sannyas. You don't have to give up your clothes. You don't have to shave your head.\n\nYou don't have to run away from this world. Bhagavad said the giving up Karmanam Kamya Naam. But then what is tyaga? He says Sarvakarma Farad Tyagam Prahu Tyagam Vichakshanah. Wise people say that giving up the anxiety for the fruits of actions is tyaga. That I have given all my worries to the Karma Phala Datta.\n\nKarma Phala Datta is always somebody other than the one who is acting. I am always the actor in the present. I act, result comes in future is always in somebody else's hand, not in mine. If something which I don't have any control over to worry about it is seems silly. But we do that all the time. So Bhagavan said that one who has given up that anxiety of the fruits of actions is the tyagi.\n\nAnd then he said some people say that all actions are imperfect. There is not a perfect action in this world. Everything will have a main result and a side effect. Something which is good will always have some imperfection in it or something not good attached to it. And something which is evil will also some good attached to it. Climate change may be disastrous to one region.\n\nIt helps other region. I was watching one of those TV channel. Whatever that fish is migrating upward. So now there were less production in USA but more production in Canada. So what is lost for the USA is gain for the Canada. So there's always something which is contrary to what a popularly understood the result of the action is.\n\nSo Bhagavan said that some people say therefore give up all actions because they are all imperfect. They will never give you perfect results. Your goal is to get the perfect happiness in life by working in this world. But even good actions will not give you the perfect happiness. That's what we say in this class. Doing good is not good enough.\n\nThat still binds you to those good results. You feel good about doing something, you want to continue doing it. Then the world doesn't let you do it and now you're mad. So some people say therefore give up all actions. But Bhagavan says no. My opinion is you should not give up Yajna Dana Tapaha Karma -- the actions of yajna, dana, and tapa.\n\nAnd then we have this confusion about what Yajna, Dana, and Tapa are for. I'm doing it for others, I'm sacrificing, I'm giving to somebody else, I'm doing charity for others. So this verse clarifies that for you. Nischayam Srunume Tatra Tyagay Bharatar Sabha, Tyagohi Purusha Vyagraha Trivedha Sampra Kirti Tah. Listen to me conclusively what Tyaga is.\n\nTyagahi Trividha Sampra Kirti Tah. Tyaga is also of three types. Two things are very common in our discussion in Bhagavad Gita. One is Tyaga and Renunciation. Second is Trigunas, satv, Rajas and Tamas. So Bhagawan said, let me tell you conclusively what Tyaga is.\n\nAnd also you should know that Tyaga is also of three types of it can be classified in the same way we have classified Ahara Yagna Tapa. All this in previous chapter Tag also can be classified in three. And Swamiji points out that Bhagavan addresses Arjuna as Purusha Vyagara, a tiger among men, boosting his morale that you can do it. Yajna Dana Tapaha Karman Karyam Eva Tat, Yagna Dana Tapahachayeva Pavanani Manishina. Here comes why Dana is for you and not for others. He said Yajna, Dana, and Tapa Karma should not be given up, because Yajna, Dana, and Tapa are the purifiers even for the wise.\n\nBut actually there is no word \"even\" in the Sanskrit here; it simply says \"for the wise people.\" Also, continuing education -- in any profession that we are in, unless you continue your education, you get stale. So when I was going for my eye surgery, when I subluxated eye lens, my cataract done four years ago, my lens has moved out. It's actually 90 degree. So obviously I didn't feel anything. But everybody who told me what it is pretty scary situation.\n\nSo I told my first surgeon that I think I want to go with somebody who has a lot of experience, who looks like me with gray hair. He said, no, no, no, Neil, don't do that. Because they are all stale, their knowledge is all outdated, you know, to go with somebody who's fresh, who has the latest knowledge. So I go to the next guy and ask him how many years of experience? How many surgeries you have done? I said, I'll go with the stale guy, the guy whose knowledge is 10 years old.\n\nSo I went with a guy who said I do it routinely for everybody, like six surgery in a month like this. So we also can say that a wise person can veer off from his knowledge. He has to constantly be on his toes to keep his mind pure. So he said this will only help wise people who are constantly doing this to keep their knowledge pristine. If you're doing yajnadanand tapa and you have no intention of getting any benefit out of it for you, then obviously it's not going to be of any value. But it will help people who are wise enough to know the value of this.\n\nThat keeping my mind and intellect pure, I need to constantly be working on it because there are lots of temptations out there in this world. And when I slip from my wisdom, nobody will know. Therefore I have to be constantly vigilant about keeping my mind and intellect -- which is my internal instrument -- pure, so that the knowledge can shine through. So therefore he says, yajna dana tapaacha pavanani manishinam. So wise people, they constantly do yajna dana and tapa to keep their internal instrument pure. So he said, this is for you to keep yourself pure so that the knowledge will always be with you.\n\nEtan apitu karmani sangam tyaktva falanicha kartabyan ITI me partha nischitam matam uttamam. And now he says that I'm going to give you my final opinion. This is my best and final opinion. So there is no confusion. So up till now Bhagavan said, I'm not the first one to tell you. Many sages have come and told you that.\n\nNow I'm telling you same knowledge. Here he comes and tells Arjuna, this is my best and final opinion for you. Because he realized that Arjuna is probably at a point where he will listen to me more than Vedas and Upanishads. He said, I'm telling you itana pito carmani sangam tyaktva falanicha. Even these actions of yajna danan tapa should be done with sangam tyaktva by giving up attachment and falanicha and giving up fruits. So two things we constantly hear, you have to detach and you have to give up.\n\nDetach from that which is not real, that which is of not any use. So there are now lots of seminars on how to keep your house healthy and happy. And their claim is to give up everything which you don't use. Take out everything from your house which you have not used in last three years, last five years, keep it out and keep what you really need. And that will make you happy. So Bhagavan said, sangam tyaktva, detach from things which are of no value to you in this world.\n\nThe objects which cannot give you happiness. Be detached from that and fala nature and also detached from the expectations for the fruit. Because even doing good, when I have an expectation of something good coming out of, ties me to the anxiety. The Bhagavan said, yajna dana and tapa should be done for one simple reason. To purify your mind and intellect, your internal instrument. Because that's all you as a seeker has to do.\n\nRest of it Bhagavan has to do. It's like all you have to do is eat digestion. I don't have to worry about it. He needs to take care of it. Same way Bhagavan said, all you have to do is keep your mind and intellect pure. I'll take care of it.\n\nSo therefore it's a you do not worry about your actions. Give up the attachment to your actions. Whether I could do it or not, did I do it right or not? Let's not get attached to it. Do for purifying your mind and intellect without any attachment and any expectations from your actions. Even expectation this will purify my mind can become a burden.\n\nYou do for your simple motive of finding that ultimate happiness. Bhagawan says, rest, I will take care of it. Therefore he says, karthiya Bhyanidi, do all these actions as I prescribed. Partha nischitam matam uttam. This is my best and final opinion. Do actions which are purifying your mind.\n\nAnd that means which we consider the punya Karma. Papa, Karma are the ones which are giving negative impressions on our mind. They should be avoided anywhere. But the ones which I am doing it to earn punya even they should be done without attachment, without an expectation for the fruits. Bhagawan says that's my best and final opinion. We had been discussing chapter 18, Moksa Sanyasa Yoga.\n\nWe have seen the conclusion of Bhagavad Gita. The last verse we had discussed is said Sarva Dharman parityajya Mamekam Sharanam Braja Ahamtwa Sarva Pape bhy moksha Shyamima Sucha. That's the conclusion. That's the essence of the entire Bhagavad Gita.",
      "reflection": "Krishna delivers his \"best and final opinion\" in these verses: yajna (sacrifice), dana (charity), and tapa (austerity) should never be abandoned because they are pavanani manishinam - purifiers even for the wise. This is a revolutionary teaching. We might think that highly evolved souls no longer need spiritual practices, but Krishna insists that even wise people require continuous purification of their internal instruments. It is like continuing education for any profession - without it, even experts become stale. The practices of sacrifice, giving, and discipline are not just for beginners; they are lifetime companions on the spiritual journey.\n\nThe profound insight here is that yajna, dana, and tapa are ultimately for you, not for others. When you give charity, the primary beneficiary is your own mind and heart being purified. When you practice austerity, your internal instrument becomes clearer. Krishna's instruction is precise: perform these actions sangam tyaktva phalani cha - without attachment and without expectation of results. Even the expectation that \"this practice will purify my mind\" can become a subtle burden.\n\nReflect today: What is your relationship with your spiritual practices? Do you perform them with a scorekeeper's mentality, tracking progress and expecting results? Or can you engage in service, giving, and discipline simply because they need to be done? Try this exercise: Perform one act of generosity today with absolutely no expectation - not even the expectation of feeling good about it. Give anonymously if possible, and observe what happens in your inner world when no one knows and no result is anticipated."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 18, Moksha Sannyasa Yoga. The very title implies that liberation will only come from renunciation. In other words, something which we are holding on to is binding us. If we let go of whatever is binding us, we'll be released. And as we have discussed many times before, this chapter is a summary of the entire Bhagavad Gita's teachings so far. All throughout these chapters which we had been discussing, there is one central theme: that either Sannyasa (renunciation) or Tyaga (abandonment) is the key to this liberation. So the chapter opened with Arjuna's question: what is Sannyasa and what is Tyaga?\n\nAnd Krishna explained that Kamyanam Karmanam Nyasa Iti Sannyasa -- giving up all the desire-prompted activity is Sannyasa, and Sarvakarma Phalatyagam -- giving up the desire for the fruits of actions is Tyaga. And then Krishna took up the theme of Tyaga as the most important thing because at our level, Sannyasa is probably not possible. Giving up all desire-prompted activities is probably not possible at our level because everything we are doing right now is prompted by some desire. Even the things which I consider I'm doing as community work or selfless activities -- when you go to the root cause of why you're doing it, there is some desire which is prompting you to do that. There are people who are involved in a lot of organizations which are community-activity based.\n\nWe know they're very active as long as they have a position -- president or chairperson or board member. And suddenly they lose that position and the person disappears from that organization. All those were supposed to be selfless activities. It was helping the community, it was helping the people it was intended for, but it was not truly selfless for the person performing it. It was not directly benefiting them in terms of monetary gain, but there was something which was feeding their ego. Bhagavan constantly says Tyaga is giving up attachment to the fruits of actions.\n\nAnd that is something which at our level we can understand and we can practice. So he takes up the theme of Tyaga and says, there are philosophers who say that all actions should be given up. Because they say any action which you perform binds you to its results, whether good or bad. Good binds you to good results, bad binds you to bad results. When you're bound by the good results, you want them to be repeated over and over and over again. I want to be successful again and again and again.\n\nI go to Las Vegas and experience beginner's luck. First time I go to the slot machine and win some money. So I think that's how it works. Next time also it should work the same way. So we get bound by this good result. And then sometimes we lose our shirt in Las Vegas and want to avoid that.\n\nSo we are bound by the results. And therefore some philosophers, Bhagavan says, says all actions must be given up. You will never be bound by anything. But Bhagawan said, that's probably not possible for us anywhere. Therefore, he says, I recommend the second opinion which says yajna dana, tapah should not be given up. Yajna the offerings, dana the charity and tapas the discipline, austerities, which is what at our level we can relate to it as what we do as yajna is all our efforts in this life is a yajna.\n\nAll that we give back to this world as our results of our efforts is adana. And whatever we do to discipline ourselves is the tapas, Bhagwan said, that should not be given up. So the definitive advice from Krishna, as we have seen so far, he says, this is my best in the firm opinion that yajna dhana, tapa should not be given up. And then obviously he says, how to look at this tyagaha? So now our central theme of Bhagavad Gita as we have seen is Krishna's doctrine is the tyaga. And the tyaga defined is Sarva Karma, Falatyaga, Sarvakarma akhila.\n\nWithout living any actions, whether it is desire prompted or selfless. In both cases, do not be in anticipation of a particular result. Because as we have seen, even in doing the selfless actions, if we are bound to the Karma phala, then it is binding your ego. So Bhagavan said, perform this yajna dhana tapa but without attachment and without the expectation for the fruits of actions. Swamiji defines attachment as ego plus egocentric Desire is attachment. I have ines and minus, then I have a desire.\n\nSo when I come in contact with an object that can satisfy the desire, I'm attached. And I these days constantly talk about how we are attached to a grandchild. You know, because our ego says that's my grandchild. And also it is enchanting. Rather it's fulfilling, enchanting. So we are attached to.\n\nSo attachment is ego plus egocentric desire. And as long as that ego and egocentric desires are there, there will be an expectation for fruits of actions. So we are already worried. She is only 20 months old. We are worried what will happen when she grow up. Will she be smart enough to do all these things?\n\nWill she be doctor or an architect? Or will she be something else? Will be artistic or athletic? We're already looking at the results of our efforts in raising her up at overload. The Bhagavan says as long as these two are there, it will be a problem. So he said, perform all this yajnadana and tapa but without attachment in expectation for the results.\n\nSo now I think I'm doing the tyaga. I'm giving up some things and then feel good about it that I gave up this thing. Let's see what kind of tyaga is that. So the next three verses says Niyatasyatu sanyasah Karmano na upopady. What should not be given up? He said: obligatory duties.\n\nThose which are the Niyata Karmas should never be given up. So we have learnt in the previous chapter there are three types of karmas. Something which you do daily -- you are not obliging anybody by doing so. Then Niyata Karma, obligatory duties. I'm a doctor, I'm an architect.\n\nI'm a father, I'm an employer. All those roles which I'm playing, it comes with its own duties. They are Niyata Karma. Those are my Niyata Karmas. I have to fulfill their duties. Then Naymithya Karma are special duties, special occasion, special situations.\n\nThese days, at least once in a while I find time from my routine and go see Dan in the hospital. That was not in my routine before, neither was it required that I go to MCV before Dan was admitted there. It's now a special condition which created a duty for me. So then Namittya Karma -- Bhagavan says none of this should be given up. It is not recommended that you give up your obligatory duties. Muha Tasha Parityagaha Tama Saha Pari Kirti Taha. Say I have given up all these duties, Niyata Karma -- I'm a father but I don't want to take care of my family.\n\nI think it is binding me, so I'm going to give it up -- because I'm confused whether I'm supposed to be doing it or not. Bhagavan says that is Tamasic Tyaga. You have given up something, but it is Tamasic -- out of delusion, out of ignorance about your duty. If I give up something because it gives me bliss in my ignorance -- say, I don't file my taxes for five years, nobody finds out, and I'm at complete bliss that I didn't pay any taxes -- that's Tamasic Tyaga. Or I don't go for voting.\n\nThis is Tamasic Tyaga, out of delusion that it is not my duty. \"I did not know I was supposed to file taxes? Well, I didn't file them. I did not know that my vote counts, so I didn't vote.\" Bhagavan says that's Tamasic Tyaga. So do all your obligated duties, but Bhagavan said, without attachment and without fixation on results.\n\nSo first thing Bhagawan said is if I give up something because of my ignorance my delusion that this is my duty it's not a tiag which is going to give me any good benefits or any more liberation. It actually binds me more to the ignorance and its consequences. Ignorance of law is not an excuse. When I came from Africa. Very first week when you start driving you're driving on a right side or left side. Your brain is not wired yet so you end up going in the wrong sense.\n\nLuckily there was no more traffic. I said I'm sorry sir but I did not know that's not an excuse my friend. You're going to get killed if you drive on the wrong side. So bear in mind that we drive on the right side not on the wrong side. Bhagavan said that's a Tamasic tyaga. I give up my duties out of delusion or ignorance -- that is Tamasic. Dukkham Itiyevayat Karma Kayakya Bhayat: I need to do this.\n\nBut it is too hard when it snows and there is a foot of snow in my front door. I have to keep my office entrance clear. So when the people come to my office, they don't fall. But it's too hard and there's nobody else to help me. Kayaklesa Bhayat Tyajet -- because of the fear of the pain to this body, I give up that action.\n\nBhagavan says sakrutva rajasam tyaga. That's the Raja Sikhtyaga. I'm giving up something I am not doing something which I should have done. I clearly know that's my duty. To keep the entrance to my house and office clean is my duty so that nobody else can get hurt by coming to my home or my office. But out of that fear that it's going to hurt my body or hurt me something, I avoid doing it.\n\nBhagavan says it is certainly tyaga, but it is a Rajasic tyaga because it creates agitation in my mind. Sometimes the things you don't do give you more agitation than the things you do. My standard example is calling my mother. My mother expects me to call every week. But I end up calling every couple of months. And then what happens is when I don't call her and as the time goes by I start feeling guilty.\n\nBut I don't get around calling her. It makes me feel even more guilty. It's still I do it that day. You know, I at least called today. I talked to her for five minutes. Okay, now I'm good for a week.\n\nWell, the week passes by. Second week, third week and I then start feeling guilty again. So this dagger of not doing my duty because it's going to disrupt something I'm doing here because of the time change. Obviously we have to either call her or call her in the morning or in the evening, late night. And then that's within my clashing, my routine. And I give up that so that it does not disturb my routine.\n\nNow it gives me pleasure. Sakrutva rajasam tyagam naivat yaga Phalam labhed. There is no benefit I'm getting out of not doing that action. So it did not benefit me at all of saving that time for not calling. It actually gave me more troubles and more agitations. Had I taken those five minutes to call her, it would have given me peace.\n\nFor next five days at least. So Bhagawan said that if you're giving up something by fear of it's going to hurt you, it's going to discomfort you, it's going to disrupt your activities.",
      "reflection": "These verses introduce the threefold classification of tyaga that illuminates our daily choices. Tamasic tyaga is abandoning obligatory duties out of delusion or ignorance - like not filing taxes because you did not know it was required, or not voting because you think it does not matter. Rajasic tyaga is avoiding duties because they seem painful or inconvenient - the fear of physical discomfort or disruption to your routine causes you to neglect what needs to be done. The striking example given is avoiding a call to an elderly parent because it disrupts your schedule, only to suffer more from lingering guilt than the five minutes the call would have taken. Sattvic tyaga, the pure form, is performing obligatory duties because they must be done, without personal desire and without craving results.\n\nThe teaching on niyata karma (obligatory duties) is particularly relevant. These are the duties that come with our roles - as parent, professional, citizen, or community member. Krishna declares that giving up these duties out of confusion is tamasic, and avoiding them out of fear of difficulty is rajasic. Neither approach yields the benefit of true renunciation. Only when we perform our duties with the attitude \"karyam iti eva\" - simply because they must be done - do we experience sattvic action.\n\nAsk yourself today: What obligatory duty am I currently avoiding? Is it because of genuine confusion about whether it is my responsibility (tamasic), or because it seems too hard or inconvenient (rajasic)? Identify one duty you have been postponing and perform it today with the simple understanding that it needs to be done. Notice how completing it releases the mental burden that avoiding it had created."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing Chapter 18, Moksha Sannyasa Yoga -- Yoga of Liberation through Renunciation. We are at the end of Bhagavad Gita. We have discussed 17 chapters. This is like making a work plan for ourselves. What is work strategy?\n\nWork strategy is capabilities plus opportunity. So we've seen our capabilities in chapter two: that this self is indestructible, only the body is destructible. And then we have seen what our opportunities are. If we can align with that supreme self -- versus identifying with this limited being called the Ego, this body, mind and intellect -- then I have a chance to achieve my goal of perennial happiness, unlimited happiness. Right now, because I am identified with this limited self, my happiness is also limited. There are limited capabilities, limited opportunities, therefore limited outcomes.\n\nBut I do have an opportunity to align myself with the unlimited self, the unconditioned self. Then my opportunities will be unlimited. Therefore I will have the unlimited happiness. That's what we have learned so far in Bhagavad Gita. Now we are making a work plan. So right from the beginning of this chapter we have seen that Arjuna asked question about what is renunciation Tyaga.\n\nFrom the overall discourse we have come to the conclusion that the only way to achieve the then Moksha, the liberation is by giving up things, not acquiring things by Tyaga and Sannyasa only. So Arjuna wanted to know what is the difference between the Tyaga and Sannyasa? And Bhagavan made it very clear in a very simple term that Karma Phala Tyaga is Tyaga. When I have no desire for particular result from my action, that's Dhyaga. And when I have no sense of agency, I have no desire for desire prompted actions, that's Sannyasa. When I give up the desire prompted action, it's Sannyasa.\n\nAnd then it seemed like Bhagavan was veering off on a tangent into a discussion about actions. It seemed like we started the discourse on Sannyasa and Tyaga, but now we are talking about action. In earlier verses we discussed what constitutes actions. There are five constituent parts of any action: Adhishtana (the body or seat of action), Karta (the doer), the organs of action, all the functions of the organs of action and perception, and then the presiding deity -- the five elemental forces. These five have to come together for any action to come into existence. If any one of them is missing, the action will not take place. If the body is not there, there won't be any action. If the ego is not there, there will also not be any action. So we have learned that action requires these five constituent parts.\n\nAnd now we'll be talking about what is the anatomy of action. So the question is why Bhagavan is moving from discussion on sannyas and tyaga into actions. If you remember, in chapter four, after learning Sankhya Yoga and Karma Yoga, we talked of Gnana Karma Sannyasa Yoga. This sannyasa from the actions is only possible by knowledge about who is the actor, who is the doer. Right now the sannyas is not possible for me as long as I'm identified with the doer.\n\nIf I think I am the doer, giving up action is not possible. Should I give up all the actions? As it seems that action is the root cause of all my problems. Action may be appropriate, inappropriate. It gives either a good, bad or somewhere in between result. Why not I get out of completely and say, well let me not act and therefore there wouldn't be any consequences.\n\nBy very nature that we are living entities, it's not possible. We have learned that in previous chapters and in this chapter there is not even for a moment that we can stay without action. Nahi Kastchat Kshanama PI Jatu Tishtadhya Karma Krut. The signature of life is action. So as long as I'm alive, I'll be acting. So giving up action is not the solution.\n\nThen what is the solution? The solution is to renounce actions in knowledge. If I take ownership of my actions, then I'm bound by my actions. It is more like filing bankruptcy. If I have a company and I have taken ownership of the company and I have done everything that is supposed to be done, and I end up with a huge debt. What is my out from there?\n\nThe American law says the only way you can get out of it, file for chapter 11. First you file for chapter 11. Say let me reorganize myself. So everything I have done right now is null and void. Nobody can come, no creditor come and ask for anything for me. And if that doesn't work out, I can reconstitute myself.\n\nI file for complete bankruptcy. At that point, I disown everything that I owned in that company. I'm no more responsible for the functioning of the company nor for the assets. I'm not the owner of the assets and I'm also not responsible for the debt. Now I'm completely free and clear from that. Therefore, we have the limited liability companies.\n\nWe want to compartmentalize our responsibility. So Bhagavan said, you can do this. You can file for bankruptcy in your actions. If you disown your actions, if you say I am not the doer then you are not responsible for any of our actions. If I realize that I am not the doer -- the \"I\" which I consider \"I\" right now is actually the conditioned self, the conditioned ego that is identified with this body, mind and intellect, and therefore I feel responsible for it.\n\nWell, if you're a doer, then as you have learned, out of the five constituent parts of the action, one is the Karta, the doer. That doer is as much involved in the action as the other four. So Bhagavan said, the only way to get out of it is to realize who the actor is. Which is what Gnana Karma Sannyasa is about. I, as an \"I\" without any superimposition on it. Superimposition is I am an architect.\n\nWell, that's a superimposition on I. I am a father, another superimposition. I am a brother, another superimposition. If I remove all the superimpositions, what remains as \"I\" -- is that \"I\" really a doer? That is the \"I\" I'm concerned about, the one that wants to be happy. So Bhagavan said that we need to understand what constitute actions. Then also now we have to understand where our misunderstanding is.\n\nSo from these previous verses we have concluded this action belongs to Prakriti, the manifest world. We also learned in chapter 13: Prakriti is the cause for Karya and Karana -- action and the instruments of action. But Purusha, Sukhadu Khana Boktrutvi Hetuhu Uchyate -- Purusha is the enjoyer of Sukha and Dukha. My nature, and the nature of the world of objects, creates this action.\n\nBecause I have a vasana for singing, I go to music concert. So this is the interaction between the world of objects and my vasanas. They are all part of this Prakriti. But I, the self is not really involved in it. I as an I has no vasanas, no conditioning. And therefore it's not involved.\n\nIf I fail to recognize, Bhagavan said, then you are the doer. As an ego, you're fully involved and vested in that and you will bear the results of it. Tatra evam sati kartaram tmanam kevalam Tu yaha pashati akrut buddhihe. Whose Buddhi is not trained in thinking finer points about what is right and what is wrong, what is reality and what is non reality. Sa pasyati durma tehi. Such a person's mind is perverted.\n\nPerverted in essence is not seeing the reality as it is and getting affected by the wrong notion of what reality is. Dhurma tehi akrad buddhi. Why these words are used? Because he says, because you are seeing. Tatyaam siddhi kartaram atmanam kevalam to yahu consider atma itself to the doer. One who sees that atma is the doer, he's wrong.\n\nBecause he does not have the finer intellect to realize what is right and wrong. Also he is influenced by wrong mati. His mind is tilted, polluted by vasanas, his intellect is clouded and therefore he does not see who the doer is. Because we elaborately analyzed and came to the conclusion that the action is only taking place in the realm of the Prakriti and the Purusha is not involved at all. The universal Purusha is not involved. We have used this example over and over again.\n\nThe space in this room is not participating in any activity of this room. But because we are identifying it with the walls, floor and ceiling, it becomes a room space. Now it is all the qualities of this room. Height, length, breadth; polluted air or clean air; light or darkness. All that is associated with this room is actually the conditioning superimposed in the space which was always here, is here and will always remain here. When you remove this building, the space will go back to its original condition.\n\nBut it was unpolluted, pristine space. That space is not taking part in any of the activity of this room. The same way, the self in me which enables me to do all these activities, when it is seen as unconditioned, is not taking any part in them. But it seems like it's taking part, because I'm identifying it with my mind, my intellect and my body. Now I'm thinking that the conditioned self is the only self and that he's the doer.\n\nThat notion is wrong and therefore we are suffering. So this verse clearly says you need to differentiate between who is the doer and who are you. Are you the conditioned self, the ego? Or you are the unconditioned self, that which is imperishable, indestructible. Yasya na aham kruta bhavah buddhi Yasya na lipya de hatwh iman lokan hanti na ni badyade. So we are coming back to what we want to know.\n\nHow should I act in this life? He said, you act as you have to. Because once you understand that yasya naham kuta bhavaha once you realize that I, the self is not the doer, not taking any part in action, I'm just a saxichaitanya. I'm just the enabler. Welfare check comes to the person who is receiving welfare. That check will enable that person to go and buy whatever necessities he has.\n\nWhat he buys is entirely up to that person. We have heard complaints about people on welfare. Use the welfare checks to go and buy beer or whatever, the alcohol versus buying food. But because that is according to him, welfare department only sends you a check, enables you to buy things in your grocery store. After that, it is entirely up to you how you use that. This life in me is enabling me to act.\n\nBut it's not taking part into what field I'm acting in. That comes from my vasanas, my mental makeup, my intellect capabilities in my body. That's how I find my field. So Bhagavan said, yasya na aham kruta bhavah. One with his finer intellect came to the conclusion that I am not the doer. Such a person Buddhi Yasyana Lipyate whose intellect is not clouded by all the experiences of my life.\n\nSo right now my Buddhi is clouded by what I experienced. Experiences press on my mind, and that impression creates what I consider to be reality. So next time when I encounter the similar situation, I'll use that as a reference point and then act accordingly. Some people who start investing in one field get successful in first venture. He continues to do that and he has more positive attitude.\n\nNext guy who does the same thing but fails the very first time, he'll have a negative impression of what to do in that field.",
      "reflection": "The portrait of a true tyagi in verse 10 is striking: one who neither hates disagreeable work nor is attached to agreeable work, who is sattvic in nature, wise, and whose doubts have been cut asunder. This person has transcended the common trap of dividing work into \"what I like\" and \"what I avoid.\" For most of us, work becomes a burden precisely because we have strong preferences. But the wise person understands that all work comes through the gunas of Prakriti, and the real self is merely the witness. The practical implication is profound: since we cannot completely give up actions while living in a body (verse 11), the path to freedom lies in giving up attachment to results.\n\nVerse 12 presents a sobering truth: for those who do not practice tyaga, actions produce three types of results after death - agreeable, disagreeable, or mixed. But for the sannyasi who has truly renounced, there is no fruit at all. This is the ultimate freedom - not escaping action but escaping the bondage of results. Like filing for bankruptcy frees you from corporate debts by dissolving ownership, disowning the sense of doership frees you from karmic bondage.\n\nToday, observe your reactions to different tasks. Notice when you approach work with enthusiasm because you like it, or with resistance because you find it disagreeable. Can you identify the underlying attachments? Practice approaching one pleasant task and one unpleasant task with the same equanimity - neither grasping at the enjoyable one nor pushing away the difficult one. This is the beginning of becoming medhavi (wise) and chinna-samshaya (free from doubt)."

      "reflection": "These verses reveal the five causes that must combine for any action to occur: adhishthana (the body or seat of action), karta (the doer or ego), karana (the various instruments or sense organs), the diverse functions of these instruments, and daivam (destiny or the presiding cosmic forces). This teaching from Sankhya philosophy dissolves the illusion that \"I alone\" am the doer. Consider: if any one of these five factors is absent, the action cannot happen. If the body is not present, if the ego is not engaged, if the instruments are not functioning, if the circumstances do not align - the action simply will not occur. This means our individual contribution is just one-fifth of the equation.\n\nThe insight becomes even more liberating when we realize that these five causes apply equally to right and wrong actions, to actions of body, speech, and mind. The mechanism of action is neutral - it is our identification with it that creates bondage. Like understanding that electricity powers both the heater and the air conditioner without preference, understanding the mechanics of action helps us stop taking personal credit or blame for outcomes that depend on factors far beyond our control.\n\nReflect on a recent accomplishment you feel proud of. Now analyze: What was the role of your body and its health? What instruments and skills were involved? What circumstances had to align? What cosmic factors - timing, luck, the cooperation of others - contributed? Honestly assess how much was truly \"you\" versus the coming together of these five factors. This contemplation naturally reduces ego and opens the door to genuine humility and freedom from the burden of being the sole doer."

There are limited capabilities, limited opportunities, therefore limited outcome.\n\nBut I do have an opportunity to align myself with the unlimited self, the unconditioned self. Then my opportunities will be unlimited. Therefore I will have the unlimited happiness. That's what we have learned so far in Bhagavad Gita. Now we are making a work plan. So right from the beginning of this chapter we have seen that Arjuna asked question about what is renunciation Tyaga.\n\nFrom the overall discourse we have come to the conclusion that the only way to achieve the then Moksha, the liberation is by giving up things, not acquiring things by Tyaga and Sannyasa only. So Arjuna wanted to know what is the difference between the Tyaga and Sannyasa? And Bhagavan made it very clear in a very simple term that Karma Phala Tyaga is Tyaga. When I have no desire for particular result from my action, that's Dhyaga. And when I have no sense of agency, I have no desire for desire prompted actions, that's Sannyasa. When I give up the desire prompted action, it's Sannyasa.\n\nAnd then it seemed like Bhagavan is veering off on a tangent into a discussion about actions. It seemed like we started the discourse on Sannyasa and Tyaga, but now we are talking about action. In the last three verses we discussed what constitutes actions. There are five constituent parts of any action: Adhishtana, Karta, the organs of action, all the functions of the organs of action and perception,\n\nand then the presiding deity -- the five elemental forces. These five have to come together for any action to come into existence. So if any one of them is missing, the action will not take place. So if the body is not there, there won't be any action. If ego is not there, there will not be any action also. So we have learned that action requires the five constituent parts.\n\nAnd now we'll be talking about what is the anatomy of action. So the question is why Bhagavan is moving from discussion on sannyas and tyaga into actions. If you remember, in chapter four, after learning Sankhya Yoga and Karma Yoga, we talked of Gnana Karma Sannyasa Yoga. This sannyasa from the actions is only possible by knowledge about who is the actor, who is the doer. Right now the sannyas is not possible for me as long as I'm identified with the doer.\n\nIf I think I am the doer, giving up action is not possible. Should I give up all the actions? As it seems that action is the root cause of all my problems. Action may be appropriate, inappropriate. It gives either a good, bad or somewhere in between result. Why not I get out of completely and say, well let me not act and therefore there wouldn't be any consequences.\n\nBy very nature that we are living entities, it's not possible. We have learned that in previous chapters and in this chapter there is not even for a moment that we can stay without action. Nahi Kastchat Kshanama PI Jatu Tishtadhya Karma Krut. The signature of life is action. So as long as I'm alive, I'll be acting. So giving up action is not the solution.\n\nThen what is the solution? The solution is to renounce actions in knowledge. If I take ownership of my actions, then I'm bound by my actions. It is more like filing bankruptcy. If I have a company and I have taken ownership of the company and I have done everything that is supposed to be done, and I end up with a huge debt. What is my out from there?\n\nThe American law says the only way you can get out of it, file for chapter 11. First you file for chapter 11. Say let me reorganize myself. So everything I have done right now is null and void. Nobody can come, no creditor come and ask for anything for me. And if that doesn't work out, I can reconstitute myself.\n\nI file for complete bankruptcy. At that point, I disown everything that I owned in that company. I'm no more responsible for the functioning of the company nor for the assets. I'm not the owner of the assets and I'm also not responsible for the debt. Now I'm completely free and clear from that. Therefore, we have the limited liability companies.\n\nWe want to compartmentalize our responsibility. So Bhagavan said, you can do this. You can file for bankruptcy in your actions. If you disown your actions, if you say I am not the doer then you are not responsible for any of our actions. If I realize that I am not the doer -- the \"I\" which I consider \"I\" right now is actually the conditioned self, the conditioned ego that is identified with this body, mind and intellect, and therefore I feel responsible for it.\n\nWell, if you're a doer, then as you have learned, out of the five constituent parts of the action, one is the Karta, the doer. That doer is as much involved in the action as the other four. So Bhagavan said, the only way to get out of it is to realize who the actor is. Which is what Gnana Karma Sannyasa is about. I, as an \"I\" without any superimposition on it. Superimposition is I am an architect.\n\nWell, that's a superimposition on I. I am a father, another superimposition. I am a brother, another superimposition. If I remove all the superimpositions, what remains as \"I\" -- is that \"I\" really a doer? That is the \"I\" I'm concerned about, the one that wants to be happy. So Bhagavan said that we need to understand what constitute actions. Then also now we have to understand where our misunderstanding is.\n\nSo from these previous verses we have concluded this action belongs to Prakriti, the manifest world. We also learned in chapter 13: Prakriti is the cause for Karya and Karana -- action and the instruments of action. But Purusha, Sukhadu Khana Boktrutvi Hetuhu Uchyate -- Purusha is the enjoyer of Sukha and Dukha. My nature, and the nature of the world of objects, creates this action.\n\nBecause I have a vasana for singing, I go to music concert. So this is the interaction between the world of objects and my vasanas. They are all part of this Prakriti. But I, the self is not really involved in it. I as an I has no vasanas, no conditioning. And therefore it's not involved.\n\nIf I fail to recognize, Bhagavan said, then you are the doer. As an ego, you're fully involved and vested in that and you will bear the results of it. Tatra evam sati kartaram tmanam kevalam Tu yaha pashati akrut buddhihe. Whose Buddhi is not trained in thinking finer points about what is right and what is wrong, what is reality and what is non reality. Sa pasyati durma tehi. Such a person's mind is perverted.\n\nPerverted in essence is not seeing the reality as it is and getting affected by the wrong notion of what reality is. Dhurma tehi akrad buddhi. Why these words are used? Because he says, because you are seeing. Tatyaam siddhi kartaram atmanam kevalam to yahu consider atma itself to the doer. One who sees that atma is the doer, he's wrong.\n\nBecause he does not have the finer intellect to realize what is right and wrong. Also he is influenced by wrong mati. His mind is tilted, polluted by vasanas, his intellect is clouded and therefore he does not see who the doer is. Because we elaborately analyzed and came to the conclusion that the action is only taking place in the realm of the Prakriti and the Purusha is not involved at all. The universal Purusha is not involved. We have used this example over and over again.\n\nThe space in this room is not participating in any activity of this room. But because we are identifying it with the walls, floor and ceiling, it becomes a room space. Now it is all the qualities of this room. Height, length, breadth; polluted air or clean air; light or darkness. All that is associated with this room is actually the conditioning superimposed in the space which was always here, is here and will always remain here. When you remove this building, the space will go back to its original condition.\n\nBut it was unpolluted, pristine space. That space is not taking part in any of the activity of this room. The same way, the self in me which enables me to do all these activities, when it is seen as unconditioned, is not taking any part in them. But it seems like it's taking part, because I'm identifying it with my mind, my intellect and my body. Now I'm thinking that the conditioned self is the only self and that he's the doer.\n\nThat notion is wrong and therefore we are suffering. So this verse clearly says you need to differentiate between who is the doer and who are you. Are you the conditioned self, the ego? Or you are the unconditioned self, that which is imperishable, indestructible. Yasya na aham kruta bhavah buddhi Yasya na lipya de hatwh iman lokan hanti na ni badyade. So we are coming back to what we want to know.\n\nHow should I act in this life? He said, you act as you have to. Because once you understand that yasya naham kuta bhavaha once you realize that I, the self is not the doer, not taking any part in action, I'm just a saxichaitanya. I'm just the enabler. Welfare check comes to the person who is receiving welfare. That check will enable that person to go and buy whatever necessities he has.\n\nWhat he buys is entirely up to that person. We have heard complaints about people on welfare. Use the welfare checks to go and buy beer or whatever, the alcohol versus buying food. But because that is according to him, welfare department only sends you a check, enables you to buy things in your grocery store. After that, it is entirely up to you how you use that. This life in me is enabling me to act.\n\nBut it's not taking part into what field I'm acting in. That comes from my vasanas, my mental makeup, my intellect capabilities in my body. That's how I find my field. So Bhagavan said, yasya na aham kruta bhavah. One with his finer intellect came to the conclusion that I am not the doer. Such a person Buddhi Yasyana Lipyate whose intellect is not clouded by all the experiences of my life.\n\nSo right now my Buddhi is clouded by what I experienced. Experiences press on my mind, and that impression creates what I consider to be reality. So next time when I encounter the similar situation, I'll use that as a reference point and then act accordingly. Some people who start investing in one field get successful in first venture. He continues to do that and he has more positive attitude.\n\nNext guy who does the same thing but fails the very first time, he'll have a negative impression of what to do in that field.",
      "reflection": "Verse 16 delivers a sharp rebuke: one who sees the Self alone as the doer, not understanding the five factors of action, is akrita-buddhi (of immature intellect) and durmati (of perverted understanding). This is strong language because the error is so consequential. When I believe \"I am the sole doer,\" I take full ownership of results I do not fully control, creating unnecessary suffering. The solution in verse 17 is equally powerful: one whose intellect is not tainted by the notion \"I am the doer\" (naham-krita-bhava) does not kill even when killing, and is not bound by actions. This is not a license for violence but a statement about the nature of liberated action - when ego is absent, karma does not stick.\n\nVerse 18 presents the complete anatomy of action through two triads. First, the impulse to action: jnana (knowledge), jneya (the object to be known), and parijnata (the knower). Second, the action itself: karana (instrument), karma (action), and karta (doer). Understanding these components helps us see how we get pulled into activity. Knowledge of a coffee shop creates the knower who desires coffee, prompting action through the instruments of body and mind. By understanding this mechanism, we gain the ability to interrupt automatic patterns.\n\nToday, when you feel compelled to act - especially in response to a strong desire or aversion - pause and identify: What is the knowledge driving this? What am I seeking to know or obtain? Who is the knower that wants this? What instruments will be employed? This brief analysis creates space between stimulus and response. In that space lies freedom. Practice this with one desire today and notice how understanding the mechanics of action naturally loosens its grip on you."

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 18, Moksha Sannyasa Yoga -- Yoga of Liberation through Renunciation. As we have discussed before, the whole exercise in Bhagavad Gita is to renounce actions in knowledge. We have figured out that actions are the cause for all my frictions and unhappiness in life. Any action which I perform, whether good, bad or ugly, will have its result. And the result will be either conducive, not conducive, or somewhere in between -- mixed. And in this chapter, Bhagavan clarifies that this only applies to those who have not given up expectation for the fruits of actions.\n\nIn this chapter we learn the definition of a Tyagi: one who gives up Karma Phala Tyaga is a Tyagi. The one who gives up all the desire-prompted actions is a Sannyasi. I can only give up all my desire-prompted actions if I have no desires. At this point, it does not seem that I can reach that point where I hold no desire. So then the question is: how can I solve this conundrum?\n\nOn one hand it says the only way you can be free is if you have no desires. On the other hand, it clearly seems that living without desires is not possible. It seems like there is something we are missing in this equation. If both are true, then there has to be some kind of parallax which I have to remove so I can see the truth as it is. This is something which we have learnt in Vedanta: that the same thing can be seen in two different lights.\n\nA rope can be seen as a rope if I'm clear about what it is. But it can also give rise to fear that it's a snake. So the same thing, depending on my mental association, can appear as a rope or as a snake. Similarly, because I can't reconcile these two -- on one hand Gita keeps telling me to live without any desires and on the other hand I see that desires are unavoidable -- it seems like there are two different kinds of people: one who cannot live without desires and one who has no desires.\n\nSo to understand that, we have obviously taken this study of Bhagavad Gita. And now we are coming to the conclusion that there are two I. The one I is a conditioned I which is conditioned by my body, my mind, my intellect, associated with my body, my mind, intellect and therefore that I has all the limitations of my body, my mind and intellect. But then there is one \"I\" which is always there. No matter what the condition of this body, mind, intellect -- the body was a baby, then it was a child, then a young man, then an adult, and now it's the old man -- that \"I\" remained the same. So there must be a differentiation between the I which I consider I when I think about my body, my mind, my intellect and that which has no conditioning.\n\nWhen I remove all the conditioning, I will not be there as this conditioned \"I,\" but that \"I\" will still remain. As we learnt in Bhagavad Gita chapter 2, that \"I\" is indestructible. The metaphor we use all the time is the room space. Room space is conditioned by its limitations of the size and shape and the type of air in it. Right now once this walls, floor and ceilings are gone the space will remain what it is. So we have learnt in chapter 13 that there is a field and it's knower. As long as there is field, I as the knower will limit myself as the knower of the field. So in this chapter we have started our journey by saying let me define what is Tyagi and what is Sannyasi.\n\nThe Tyagi does not give up the Karmaphalas, because Karmaphalas are not in his hand. Karma Phala Datta -- someone other than me -- gives me the fruits of my actions. But I want to influence that outcome by my desires. That I want this particular outcome.\n\nThat if I give up influencing the outcome by my desires then I will be Karma Falathyagi. If you know this, then the next thing you need to know is that any kind of results which come from your actions are not binding to you. Because you did not expect any result out of it. Whatever comes you accept with the Prasad Buddhi. Just like when you go to the temple and you accept Prasad, you don't really are choosy about what comes in your prasad. Whatever Panditja gives you, accept it with love.\n\nWhen whatever comes out of my actions is the result, I should accept that. Just as I accept Prasad from Bhagavan. If I develop this sense, Bhagavan said, you will be a Tyagi. Once you disassociate from this limited \"I,\" you will not have desires. That higher \"I\" will not have desires. The smaller \"I\" will have desires. The body will have its own demands, mind will have its own demands and intellect will own demands.\n\nThe one who is overseeing the three will have no demands whatsoever. It is now up to me to identify either with the lower \"I\" or the higher \"I.\" So we have learned from the beginning that giving up actions is not possible. Therefore, whatever action you perform should be ordained action. Those even when I am performing, I should be not attached. It should be performed without any Ra, without any asakti, without any expectation and any attachment.\n\nI should be performing this action without attachment. That's the advice we've heard so far. Then Bhagavan got into the discussion of what action is, because we need to understand it. We understood that action has five components. Unless those five come together, action never takes place.\n\nIn these five components, one is Karta, the actor. You have to have an actor or an action to come into being. And that's the only one I have control over. Then I need to now define who the Karta is. And that once I figure out, then I will be able to figure out whether I am the sufferer, the enjoyer of my actions or not. Because the Karta is the Bhokta of all the actions.\n\nSo in the following _Verses_ we have seen that one who considers that this self is the doer, he does not see the truth alone. Because the truth is the self is not acting at all. In all these actions which I am performing, the self remains as just a witness. Because actions are performed by the gunas of my body, mind and intellect. The nature of my mind, nature of my intellect and nature of my body decide what type of actions I'll perform. When the conducive objects come in my way, I get tempted to act and then I act.\n\nGnanam, gneam, parignata, Trivedaha, Karma, Chodana. These are the propellers of my actions. Gnanam, knowledge, Gnayam the knowable and Pariganatha the knower. So this is basically going back to chapter 13. In chapter 13 we are seeing there is a field and its knower. So when this gnanam, when there is a knowledge of the field occurs, that's the knowledge.\n\nOnce I figure out this is the field of my activity and I identify it, then the knower comes into being. As long as I'm aware of the field, I become the knower of the field. So this three when the knower of the field identifies the field and when that knowledge takes place the gnanam that becomes the propeller of my action. Starbucks is the field of my knowledge. Passing by I identify Starbucks.\n\nThe field of knowledge is there and my knowledge has taken place -- the Starbucks is there. I as the knower of the field will have the desire to have a cup of coffee. That knowledge of the field by the knower is the propeller of action. As long as I'm identified as the knower of the field constantly associating with the field that knowledge will create the impulse in me to act in this world. So that's clearly Bhagawan said you should understand that the knower of the field minus the field is just the knower.\n\nKnowledge of the field minus the field is just the knowledge. So that knowledge is I exist in my deep sleep. I have no other knowledge but I still know that I exist. So when I wake up and somebody asks what kind of sleep? You say I had a very nice sleep. I said I don't know, I just had a good sleep.\n\nThere is no other experience but just I exist in the experience. Bhagavan said, know how these actions work. When the field comes in contact with the knower of the field when knowledge takes place that knowledge will be the propeller of your action. And then he says Karanam Karma Karta ITI Trivedha Karma Sangrah what will preserve the action? Three things to come together. Karanamdhi instrument of action.\n\nI see a nice house in a good neighborhood. I really want to buy this house. But then I figure out: do I have the means to buy the house? If I don't have the means, all that good idea about that house and my desire to buy it remains just a dream. I will only put that into action if I have the means to perform that action -- that is Karanam.\n\nWhen I have the Karana -- the means, the equipment to perform this action -- then we need the Karta, the doer. If there is no doer, I may have all the means and all the desires, but if I am not available to perform that action, then it won't come into existence. So these two have to come together. The Karanam and Karta have to come together for Karma to take place. We are analyzing what the impulse of action is, and how action comes into being, because at the end of this discussion we're going to find out what control I have over my actions.\n\nWe are coming to the conclusion that the person that I really have control over is the Kartha. If I don't have that doership Bhav that notion that I am the doer then no action really takes place. So that I, which we call it the conditioned I Jivatma is thinking that he is the doer. Not only is thinking he is the doer, he is the only doer. When I perform any action and it is successful I feel that I did it and I did it all by myself. There was no help from anybody else.\n\nThis is where Bhagavan says you are going wrong. That you think you are the doer and you are the only doer. If I think that I have the control over my actions and I perform my actions then obviously I have a particular result in mind. Because I think I'm performing it correctly. I'm performing right field. The result must be X, Y or Z.\n\nWe forget that for any action I have to perform the field of action has to be appropriately configured to drive from my home to here. The whole field of action which is my road from my house to here has to be completely clear. All traffic lights have to work perfectly. All other drivers should drive in the proper lanes. Unless all that come in property configuration I wouldn't be able to come here in time. So when I consider that I did everything myself to come here in time, I'm actually wrong.\n\nThere are so many people have to do so many things for me to be here on time.",
      "reflection": "These verses introduce the threefold classification of knowledge based on the gunas. Sattvic knowledge perceives the One immutable Reality in all diverse beings - seeing the undivided in the divided (verse 20). Rajasic knowledge sees beings as separate and unrelated, perceiving manifold distinct entities everywhere (verse 21). This distinction has immediate practical implications. When we have sattvic knowledge about our own body, our hand rushes to help our aching leg without negotiation - there is complete unity. But with rajasic knowledge about the world, we see others as fundamentally separate, requiring permission, contracts, and boundaries for any cooperation.\n\nThe key insight is that our type of knowledge determines our type of action. If I see the world as a collection of separate, competing entities (rajasic knowledge), my actions will naturally be self-protective and acquisitive. If I perceive the same consciousness animating all beings (sattvic knowledge), my actions become naturally harmonious and selfless - like the seamless coordination within my own body. The knower, the knowledge, and the knowable are the propellers of action. Transform the knowledge, and the actions transform automatically.\n\nExamine your perception today: When you interact with family, colleagues, or strangers, what do you fundamentally see? Separate beings competing for limited resources? Or the same life force expressing through different forms? Choose one interaction today and consciously shift to sattvic perception - see the other person as another expression of the same consciousness that animates you. Notice how this shift in perception naturally changes the quality of your interaction, making it more easeful and compassionate."

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 18, Moksha Sannyasa Yoga -- Yoga of Liberation through Renunciation. We had been discussing that this renunciation is of the actions which we are performing. Renouncing the actions will liberate me. And then we have also seen that all actions cannot be renounced. Therefore, the actions which are helping me in purifying my internal instrument, the Antahkarana, those actions must be performed. And Bhagavan said, even for the wise people, even one who has achieved this knowledge -- if they stop performing these actions, there is the danger of getting pollution on their mind and intellect, or getting Tamas clouding over the mind and intellect again.\n\nSo they also continue these actions. It's like continuous maintenance. You have to continue to act in the manner which purifies our internal instrument, the Antahkarana. Your actions should be for the purpose of purifying mind and intellect, so they remain in a Sattvic, clean mode where you can see the reality as it is all the time. And those actions must be performed in the right attitude and the right manner.\n\nThen we have also discussed that actions are prompted by knowledge -- I know something which I either like or dislike, and I come to the conclusion that that's the field of my action. So knowledge is the propeller of action. The knowledge, the knower, and that which is to be known are the three propellers of action that propel you to act in this world. The last three verses analyzed knowledge, showing that even knowledge can be of three different types. Like everything else we have discussed in Bhagavad Gita and Vedanta, things can be classified broadly into three categories: Sattvic, Rajasic, and Tamasic. Because these are the qualities of Maya.\n\nThis world is nothing but the projection through Maya. So everything in this world can be classified into these three categories. Knowledge can be Sattvic, Rajasic, or Tamasic. Sattvic knowledge is the one which makes me see the unity in diversity -- I can see the same immutable reality pulsating through all beings and things. That knowledge which makes me see that is the Sattvic knowledge, the pure knowledge. The knowledge which makes me see the plurality -- that this world is made up of innumerable various things and beings unrelated to each other -- is called Rajasic, because it divides my world into \"I\" and \"the world.\" I am separate from this world.\n\nAnd this world is also not a one entity but conglomeration of various beings and things. That's Rajasic knowledge. And that creates again another division of the world: things which I like and things which I do not like. And then the third we have seen is Tamasic knowledge, which is a very narrow focus on a view or a philosophy. One may say, \"this is reality.\" In Sanskrit we say kupamanduk, like the frog in a well.\n\nFor that frog, the well is the world. There is nothing beyond that. Obviously we know that is because of the frog's ignorance about the rest of the world. The same way, if we hold a view that this is real and everything else that other people tell me or believe is wrong, then it's Tamasic knowledge. It's out of delusion, out of confusion, out of ignorance that I hold that view. That's Tamasic knowledge.\n\nBhagavan said it is important for us to know what type of knowledge we have, because my actions will be guided by the views I hold because of my knowledge. We have seen the example that because I have a complete sattvic knowledge about my own self, when it comes to my body, the actions are completely synchronized. That when there is a pain in our leg, my hand and arm rush there to help that. That's because the knowledge is purely sattvic about myself that I pervade through this entire body. There is a unity in this diversity of limbs I have in my body.\n\nAnd therefore my actions are also sattvic. There is no permission to be granted to the hand to go and massage the leg, which is if I have the similar reason for the rest of the world, my action will be exactly like that. So the next three verses say actions can also be classified -- depending on what propelled them -- into Sattvic, Rajasic, and Tamasic. Niyatam Sangarahitam: that action which is done with the attitude that it needs to be done, and therefore I'm doing it. My hand does not ask permission because it needs to be done.\n\nIf I will have the same view, if there's any pain anywhere, I just won't be able to stop myself to go and help. But right now I divide my world. \"Well, that's all happening in Egypt, so it's not my problem. We are fine here. Let me call my brothers and sisters in India -- well, they are doing fine.\"\n\nSo I think we are okay. Because I don't feel that connection, that unity with the people who are suffering or people who need help. Bhagavan said, one who does this action -- the action which is ordained -- does it without attachment. There are no likes or dislikes.\n\nThere is no particular attachment in the left leg versus right leg. Even though my right leg is probably broken and needs more care. But I see them completely unattached manner. My actions are ordained. In a sense, I feel compelled to act by my nature and my instinct because of the oneness I feel with that entity. Without any attachment, there is no particular reason that I want to help that person or want to do that action.\n\nIt just needs to be done. I don't have a particular love for that action or hate for their action. And there is no expectation of a particular result to come out. Such an action is considered satwik. That's because it will create the bliss internally for me in my internal instrument. Once I perform that action, there is no agitation.\n\nThere is no lingering thought, why did I do it? Was that the right thing to do or not? There is no after effect of my action and therefore it is sattvic. So there is a bliss inside. As Bhagavan said, the harmony outside the field in which I'm acting, there is also no agitation. Because I read something, the people I'm working with, there is no agitation with them.\n\nThey also feel harmony. And we know that when we are in some kind of community action where you really don't have anything to gain but just want to help out, you feel harmony there. With other actions, you don't feel harmony. That's because they fall into the next category -- Rajasic action. Most of our actions unfortunately fall into this category.\n\nFirst of all, it's done because it's prompted by my desire. I want to get something out of it, therefore I'm doing it. Their desire prompted action. I want to gain something out of it. Why did you join this organization?\n\nWell, it's good networking. It's a Rotary Club or a Lions Club or something. It's supposed to be just for community development. But what does the marketing guy say? \"If you really want to be successful, you should join your local Rotary Club or a Lions Club or something.\" So you have a networking.\n\nBy the way, some people may get benefit. That's a side effect of my joining. My main goal was to get a networking. I actually did a leadership metro course in 2003. It's pretty prestigious -- a lot of CEOs and presidents and all that.\n\nIt's basically for developing leadership in the area. But you ask them what the incentive is, and they say, \"Well, you will get to know all the CEOs and presidents in this town. Good networking tool for your business.\" Now, by the way, if somebody is doing that and helping the community, it is still good enough. The people who are doing these actions for the wrong reasons but having a right effect on society -- let them do it, don't stop them.\n\nBut it is not helping the person who is doing it. So that's action which is prompted by desire. And again, it is also done with an ego. I am doing it, you know, nobody else was ready, but I said nobody else could have done it. But I said I can do that. So kriyate Bahula Yasam and it requires lots of efforts.\n\nSomething which does not come naturally to you obviously requires lots of effort. The guy who is trained singer, when he sings, how much effort does he have to put nothing he naturally because he's trained. All his systems are wired for it. His vocal cords are trained for that. And he just comes out and sings and goes away. Somebody like me, somebody says, neel, you have to perform on such and such.\n\nWell, I have to practice and make sure that I understand lots of effort because it does not come naturally to me. So Bahula Yasam all our actions which are prompted by desire and done with ego require lots of efforts. And that's where we have a fatigue. When I say the burnout factor, you know, well, I had been helping this community for a long time. Well, volunteers make sure they don't get burned out. If they're truly volunteering, they will never get burned out.\n\nThey get burned out because there was something other than just helping was involved. Well, people are not giving me credit for what I'm doing. That feeling makes you burn out of what you are doing. Bhagavan said they are doing it with lots of effort, and therefore there is fatigue, there is a burnout factor, there is disharmony and agitation within. Sattvic action creates bliss within and harmony outside.\n\nRajasic actions create agitation inside and disharmony outside. \"I wanted to do it, but he is now doing it. I wanted to be the president of this organization. Even though I don't get anything out of it, nobody pays me for that -- but now he is doing it.\" So there is agitation, disharmony.\n\nTherefore these actions are called Rajasic. Swamiji makes a very good point that even the great political leaders, great social workers, and great leaders in the business world all fall into Rajasic action at the best of their behavior or the best of their intentions. Because the same action can be Tamasic -- one which looks Rajasic but could be Tamasic. He says Rajasic actions are clearly better than Tamasic. You now just have to graduate from Rajasic to Sattvic to get the bliss which you're seeking, the happiness which you are looking for.\n\nYou have to transcend Rajasic into Sattvic. But be careful -- what you consider Rajasic may actually be Tamasic. So the next verse says what Tamasic action is: those actions are first of all prompted by delusion. I want to do this because I do not know what is the right thing to do.",
      "reflection": "These verses classify actions themselves according to the three gunas. Sattvic action is niyatam (ordained/obligatory), performed sangam rahitam (without attachment), araga-dveshatah (without likes or dislikes), and aphala-prepsuna (without desire for results). Rajasic action is driven by desire (kamepsuna), performed with ego (sahamkarena), and involves bahula-ayasam (great effort/strain). The contrast is illuminating: sattvic action flows naturally and creates inner bliss and outer harmony, while rajasic action requires tremendous effort and creates internal agitation and external discord.\n\nThe description of rajasic action in verse 24 deserves special attention. When work is desire-driven and ego-centered, it demands great effort. This explains burnout in volunteers and professionals alike - when we work for recognition, position, or personal gain, we become exhausted because we are fighting against the natural flow. Swamiji points out that even great social workers and business leaders, at their best, often operate at the rajasic level. The challenge is to graduate from rajasic to sattvic action.\n\nToday, examine the effort level in your activities. Where does work feel like a struggle, requiring you to push through resistance? This may indicate rajasic motivation - desire for results or ego investment. Where does action feel effortless, almost doing itself? This points toward sattvic action. Choose one task that feels burdensome and ask: What am I really seeking from this? Can I perform it simply because it needs to be done, without attachment to how others receive it or what it produces? This shift from \"I want\" to \"this needs doing\" transforms the entire experience."

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 18, Moksha Sannyasa Yoga. Just to remind ourselves what we have seen so far: in the beginning, Arjuna made a request -- I want to know what is Sannyasa and what is Tyaga? Because we had been talking about renunciation. This chapter is called Liberation through Renunciation. So the obvious answer is renouncing actions.\n\nAnd how do we renounce actions and what type of actions can we renounce or should we renounce is the gist of this chapter. So the first thing Bhagavan said is Kamyanam Karmanam Nyasa Iti Sannyasa -- giving up all the desire-prompted actions is Sannyasa. It's as simple as that. If I can give up all desire-prompted actions so that I'm truly driven by my duties, the joy of working, and whatever is appropriate for me to do, then I am a Sannyasi. But that may or may not be possible. So the next teaching is Sarvakarma Phala Tyaga Iti Tyaga.\n\nIf you give up all the Karma Phala, the desire for the fruits of action, then it's Tyaga. So Bhagavan starts with Tyaga because that may be more appropriate for us. So then he describes that even tyaga can be of three different types. So now the entire chapter takes up the aspect of actions -- which is what is binding us. Actions in our day-to-day life, what we call work, are becoming a burden for us. That's why we all want to retire.\n\nAll our planning for is what retirement. That's because we are not enjoying the work. So Bhagawan said let's understand what tyaga is. So then we have seen that the tyaga also can be of three types of you can give up something which is you're appropriately giving up because of sattvic reasons or rajasic reasons or tamasic reasons. Then we said the tyaga we talked about of actions. So what type of actions should be given up and what should not be given up?\n\nWe said the yajna dana tapa, this type of actions must be performed. So even the yajnas can be of three types. Sattvik, Rajasika, Tamasik, Dana also can be of three types. SattVik, Rajasik and tamasic. The disciplines which we follow can also be three types. Sattvik, rajasik, tamasik.\n\nIn other words, everything is tied to each other. How we think, how we behave and what the results come to us, they're all tied to each other. Our thinking is not sattvic, then obviously our actions will not be sattvic and therefore our results will not be satwik. So if we understand this mechanism of actions, then maybe we will be able to liberate ourselves from this burden of work. In India, at least in the 60s that I can remember, the first thing people would ask is, \"So where are you working?\" Oh, I just got a job in government.\n\nI think it's a perfect job. I'll tell you, I hardly have to work. The definition of good job in many times in India was the job in which I did the least amount of work is a good job. Now is it really what I'm looking for in a job? I remember when I went to Zambia. I took a job at the building department in the government of Zambia.\n\nSo my chief architect, first day in orientation said, we have a requirement that in a year you should at least do three drawings. And I said, are you serious? He said, no, at least you should have three drawings in a year. So that was a government standard of your performance. Our basic understanding right now is that action is a burden. Actually, as long as I can get out of the actions, then I'll be happy.\n\nSo renouncing action is the goal of our life. But how to renounce action is the theme of this chapter. So we say even yajna dana tapas, which needs to be done also should be done in a manner that it liberates you and not binds you. So yagnas can be of three types, Dhyana can be of three types, and tapas can be of three types. And we all know sometimes we do charity. But that makes you unhappy.\n\nInstead of making you feel joy about giving, it makes you unhappy. That's because our attitude towards giving had something not right about it. So Bhagavan said, you should examine this thing in all things you do, whether it's sattvik, tamasic or rajasik, and see what is appropriate for you. Then we said, okay, Karma. Now let's understand what is the nature of Karma. And I said: Karma, Karana, Karta.\n\nThese are the three constituent parts of any action. Any action will have an action, a doer, and an instrument of action. And that requires knowledge. Gnanam, Gneyam, Parignata -- these are the three constituent parts: the knowledge, that which is to be known, and the knower. If we understand the mechanism of these actions and how the knowledge takes place, then we should be able to work better.\n\nSo then we have looked at how the knowledge takes place and how the action is related to it. So then we have been looking at and say, okay, now if knowledge also can be of three types. Some knowledge is Sattvic, some is Rajasic and some is Tamasic. Something I come to believe without any reason or rhyme could be tamasic. So knowledge also can be Sattvik, Rajasik or Tamasik. I should be very careful.\n\nEven I consider myself a more knowledgeable person. I need to examine whether my knowledge is appropriate or Sattvik or Rajasik or Tamasakya. Obviously, before whoever figured it out that earth is round, people had knowledge the earth is flat. But it was not really a knowledge based on any basis, but just a regular observation that looks like earth is flat. So sometimes what is quite obvious may not be the truth. So I need to be constantly vigilant about it.\n\nSo my knowledge also should be examined whether it is Rajasik, Tamasik or Sattvik. Then Karma, which I am performing, also can be Rajasic, Tamasic or Sattvik, depending on the knowledge which I have, is whether Sattvik, Rajasik or Tamasik. So these are all tied together in every aspect of my life. I should be examining whether this is the most appropriate way to behave. So then the verses which we'll be saying today they about Karta, Karta. I consider myself the doer.\n\nNow am I a Sattvik doer, a Rajasic doer, a Tamasic doer? Then we find out that it's not a consistent that I am not always a Sattvic doer, I'm not always a Rajasik doer. I'm not always a Tamasik doer. At times I'm Sattvik, at times I'm Rajasik, at times I'm Tamasik. However, I must examine that and make sure that I do not become predominantly Tamasic or Rajasic. Because the results of Tamas and Rajas, as we have seen, are nothing but pain in the end.\n\nThe only thing which liberates you is sattva, the pure knowledge. When I start seeing things as they are, that's where the liberation comes in. Anytime I have bias of my own, then I'm bound by my own bias. More and more people realizing that more they limit themselves to one viewpoint or one group of people, they're binding themselves to limitations. The more they open up, they become more liberated and make more progress. So the verse 26 says Mukta Sangha Anahamvadi Dhruti Utsa Samanvitah Siddhi Asidyo nirvikaraha karta satvika uchate.\n\nIf I am a doer and I consider myself the person performing this action, well, let's see in what attitude I perform it. Mukta Sangha -- free from attachment. Am I really too attached to this action? If somebody lets me do it, great. If I don't get a chance to do this, am I okay? Or is the world going to come apart if I don't get a chance to do this? Unattached. Anahamvadi -- he does not have the ego that \"I am the doer.\"\n\nI am the only one who can do it. I can do this so that we know that if I can do it, the others can also do it. However, I can put the best efforts if I want. Dhruti Utsa Samanvitah -- I think this, at least from my life, is the most important part. Whether you are successful or not successful in what you are pursuing. Again dhruti persistent firmness.\n\nThis is what I want to do. When I came to this country, I kept giving my life's example because that's all I know is my life. When I came to this country, I met some architects who had been here 10 years before I had come. So I asked their advice and said what should I do? I need to get registration as a licensed architect in this country. They forget about it.\n\nIt's not really worth it. It will take you 10 years. There are better professions with your architectural training. You can be a pipe draftsman or something which will give you a better compensation. And I say, I'll tell you honestly, the only thing I know is architecture. So I need to pursue architecture.\n\nWhether there are good chances in this country or not. I have to continue find my niche because I don't know anything better. But I say only thing I know is doing architecture. So Dhruti -- if you want to be successful in architecture, stay with architecture. Don't buy a gas station; don't open up a hotel.\n\nDhruti is the most important aspect of any actions we will perform. If you are yourself not firm about it, people will recognize right away that you are not serious about it. And the next quality, which I learned from my guru Swami Chinmayananda, is Utsaha -- enthusiasm. Swamiji had a unique quality: he would infuse enthusiasm in anybody he met. Everybody in front of him was like Swamiji we can do this and Swamiji we can do that. That's a unique quality that you can inspire people to be enthusiastic about what they are doing.\n\nAnd again, if you are not enthusiastic, everybody else will be also the same way. The most important aspects of any doer are Dhruti and Utsaha -- Samanvitah Siddhi Asidyo Nirvikaraha. Having done all that, the result is not in my hand. I may be the best person, I may be the best firm. But the world may have different needs and the world may react differently. And therefore it may not be a successful action.\n\nAnd I should be unattached to that. Do not get affected by it. We are human beings, we have emotions. We may feel slightly bad about it, but you have to move on from that. It should not affect your personality that now I'm rejected one time, I will not try next time. In fact, continue trying to persistently keep going back and back to the same organization or efforts to be successful.\n\nPersistence pays off. Siddhi Asidyo Nirvikarah karta satvikochate. Such an actor, such a doer is considered Sattvik. He may be successful, he may not be successful. He may be appreciated. He may not be appreciated.\n\nBut he knows that he's pursuing this with all his zeal and all firmness. So that's such a doer is Sattvik the next one. Ragi Karma Phala prepsuhu lubdaha in Satmakaha Asuchi Harshoka Anvitah karta Rajasah Parikertita. However, when we are in that mode, we don't recognize it. Unfortunately, it's a ragi attached sometimes with a good virtue. He's very passionate about it.\n\nPassion is something which can be very tricky to recognize whether it is positive or negative. The same passion, it is based on your dhruti then it is positive.",
      "reflection": "After classifying knowledge and action, these verses turn to the actor. The sattvic doer (verse 26) is mukta-sanga (free from attachment), anaham-vadi (without ego-assertion), endowed with dhriti (steadfastness) and utsaha (enthusiasm), and nirvikara (unchanged) in success or failure. This portrait challenges our usual understanding of success. The sattvic actor is not passive but combines firmness with detachment - persistently pursuing goals without being shattered by setbacks or inflated by achievements. Dhriti and utsaha - persistence and enthusiasm - are highlighted as essential qualities for any endeavor.\n\nThe rajasic doer (verse 27) is driven by passion and greed for results, capable of violence and impurity, and swings between elation and sorrow based on outcomes. This describes most of us in our professional lives - attached to outcomes, devastated by failure, euphoric in success. The symptoms are clear: harsha-shoka-anvita, constantly oscillating between joy and sorrow based on external circumstances. This emotional volatility is the signature of rajasic doership.\n\nReflect on your own tendencies: When you undertake projects, how do you respond to success and failure? Does achievement make you think \"I did this\" while failure makes you defensive or depressed? True dhriti (steadfastness) means continuing your efforts regardless of immediate results. True utsaha (enthusiasm) comes from the work itself, not from anticipated rewards. Today, notice one moment when your mood shifts based on results - a compliment lifts you, a criticism deflates you. This is rajasic reactivity. Practice returning to center: \"I did what was needed; the result belongs to the field of action, not to me.\""

The most important aspects of any doer are Dhruti and Utsaha -- Samanvitah Siddhi Asidyo Nirvikaraha. Having done all that, the result is not in my hand. I may be the best person, I may be the best firm. But the world may have different needs and the world may react differently. And therefore it may not be a successful action.\n\nAnd I should be unattached to that. Do not get affected by it. We are human beings, we have emotions. We may feel slightly bad about it, but you have to move on from that. It should not affect your personality that now I'm rejected one time, I will not try next time. In fact, continue trying to persistently keep going back and back to the same organization or efforts to be successful.\n\nPersistence pays off. Siddhi Asidyo Nirvikarah karta satvikochate. Such an actor, such a doer is considered Sattvik. He may be successful, he may not be successful. He may be appreciated. He may not be appreciated.\n\nBut he knows that he's pursuing this with all his zeal and all firmness. So that's such a doer is Sattvik the next one. Ragi Karma Phala prepsuhu lubdaha in Satmakaha Asuchi Harshoka Anvitah karta Rajasah Parikertita. However, when we are in that mode, we don't recognize it. Unfortunately, it's a ragi attached sometimes with a good virtue. He's very passionate about it.\n\nPassion is something which can be very tricky to recognize whether it is positive or negative. The same passion, it is based on your dhruti then it is positive.",
      "reflection": "Verse 28 completes the portrait of the tamasic doer: ayukta (undisciplined), prakrita (vulgar), stabdha (obstinate), shatha (deceitful), naishkritika (malicious), alasa (lazy), vishadi (despondent), and dirgha-sutri (procrastinating). This is a catalog of self-defeating tendencies that prevent meaningful action. The combination is revealing - laziness paired with obstinacy, deceit with procrastination. These qualities feed on each other, creating a downward spiral that keeps one trapped in inertia and ineffectiveness.\n\nVerses 29-30 shift to buddhi (intellect), the guiding faculty that determines which actions to pursue. Sattvic buddhi knows pravritti (what should be done) and nivritti (what should be avoided), karya (duty) and akarya (non-duty), bhaya (what to fear) and abhaya (what not to fear), bandha (bondage) and moksha (liberation). This discriminative capacity is the cornerstone of wise living. Without clear buddhi, even good intentions lead to confused actions. The sattvic intellect serves as an internal compass, consistently pointing toward what truly matters.\n\nExamine your own buddhi today: How clear is your discrimination between what binds you and what liberates you? We often know intellectually what we should do but find ourselves doing the opposite. This gap indicates the need to strengthen sattvic buddhi through consistent practice. Ask yourself: In the decisions I face today, can I clearly see which choice leads toward freedom and which toward bondage? Make one choice today based purely on this discrimination - not on what feels good or what others expect, but on what your purified intellect recognizes as the path to liberation."

      "commentary": "We've been discussing chapter 18, Moksha Sannyasa Yoga, Yoga of Liberation through Renunciation. The goal is liberation and the tool is Sannyasa. Liberation is always from some bondage, and normally we think the bondage is always imposed by someone else. But in this case, Bhagavad Gita says the bondages are imposed by my own self. I myself have imposed these bondages on me by identifying with this material body, this material self -- the equipment which I use to transact with this world. I falsely understood it to be me.\n\nAnd now all the limitations of this instrument have become my limitations. Sorrows and unhappiness are just the product of these limitations. And therefore, if I need to find ultimate happiness and ultimate liberation from sorrows and unhappiness, I need to get rid of the bondages. So this chapter says this liberation can only come from Sannyasa. The only means available to us is Sannyasa. So then, what is Sannyasa? We learn it is Kamyanam Karmanam Nyasa.\n\nAll you have to do is simply give up the desire prompted actions. This we found is not easy. So the means again given is Tyaga. Give up the anxiety for the fruits of actions and over a period of time you will develop Sannyasa. Once you give up the anxiety of the fruits of action, work in this world and you will develop that understanding of who you are and you will overcome the limitations that you have. That basically what we understood in the gist of the entire Bhagavad Gita.\n\nSo now this chapter summarizing our endeavor, pursuing this path of Tyaga and then ultimately getting Sannyasa, examining all the qualities that we have acquired by just associating with this Prakriti. We have this long history of associating with this Prakriti. All this time the only thing I could associate with is my material nature. Therefore all the qualities of the Prakriti became my qualities. And we have learnt in Vedanta that this Prakriti has three basic Gunas, Satvarajas and Tamas. So everything associated with me is tainted by these three gunas.\n\nMy goal is to go beyond these three gunas and liberate myself from this identification of this Prakriti. So therefore, we have examined what makes me attached to this work. And the first thing came the Gnana. The knowledge that the Prakriti exists and I'm aware of it, makes me identify with it. It's like somebody says, why are you climbing this mountain? If I did not know it is there, I would never have any need to climb that mountain.\n\nBut because it is there, I have to now climb it. Because I'm aware of the Prakriti, I identify with that recruitment because I'm aware of the world of my liking. I identify with the world which I like. Also I'm aware of the world of my dislike. And again, I identify with that world for avoiding it. So my entire pursuit in life becomes pursuing that which I like and avoid that which I don't like.\n\nIn all cases, what is common is my knowledge about that field of activity. The first thing you need to say, what is the Gnana? The Gnana, what you consider Gnana at this time is of the Prakriti. Therefore it falls into these three categories of Sattvik, Rajasic and Tamasic. Just as the nature of the Prakruti has these three gunas, so we've seen the knowledge is also Sattvic, Rajasik and Tamasic. Then he said, now the next person involved in this action is the Karta.\n\nOne who considers that I exist and I do things. He said, that person again is tainted by the three gunas of the Prakriti because of the identification of the Prakriti. So the Karta can be Sattvic, Rajasic, or Tamasic. Now you put the two together. Knowledge and I as the doer both have tendencies which are Sattvic, Rajasic, or Tamasic.\n\nThe final product which comes out -- actions -- will also be Sattvic, Rajasic, or Tamasic. All these we are evaluating and understanding so that we can introspect and see where we fall in this category, where our actions fall. Because one thing we have learned is that the gradual progression is from Tamasic to Rajasic to Sattvic. Once I have purified my mind and intellect, the only obligation I have as the seeker of the truth is to purify my internal instrument, Antakarana, my mind and intellect. Once mind and intellect is pure, the knowledge will shine through by itself, there will be no effort required. Therefore, we keep hearing the term praptasyaprapti.\n\nThis knowledge which I'm seeking about myself is already available to me. It's already with me. I'm just not seeing it because I'm so engrossed in the knowledge of this world that I'm completely oblivious about the knowledge about myself. Once I get rid of this knowledge which is falsely coloring my personality as Sattvic, Rajasic, or Tamasic, the true knowledge will shine through. To know this and to negate the qualities which are binding, gradually rise from Tamasic to Rajasic to Sattvic. Once I reach that sattvic tendencies and my mind and intellect are purified, the knowledge will shine through.\n\nIf this room is dark, my key is in this room. Only thing I require is turn the lights on. It will be very easy for me to find where my keys are. So Bhagawan said that this knowledge is within yourself. You already have it and therefore nothing new you will find. There is no new accomplishments to be made.\n\nThere is no new achievements to be achieved. But finding your own self would be like finding the keys in your pocket and becoming aware of it. Therefore, the word is realization. All I am doing is becoming realized about my own self. So if you examine Gnana Karta, Karma, then Bhagwancha Buddhi, which is a guiding factor. I see the objects or the field of actions in this world, then knowledge takes place.\n\nMind decide whether it is like or unlikable. Finding guidance from the intellect, then intellect will tell you how to act in this world. So therefore Buddhi is to be evaluated as whether it is Sattvik, Rajasik or Tamasik. So we have looked at the Buddhi also. Now all of that is only useful if I'm consistently pursuing my path of evolution from Tamasic to Rajasic to Sattvik. Because anything if I do once in a while is of not great value.\n\nSomething which I do consistently, then it will have positive effect for me to become an expert in anything, I have to continuously work in that field. Once in a while I do something, it becomes hobby. That's why I'm not so good. But somebody who does it consistently, he becomes good at it. So Bhagavan said Dhruti is a very important factor in becoming successful and getting rid of unhappiness and sorrows -- the limitations of this body and intellect, the bondages. To get rid of them and to work consistently -- that consistency is what we have seen as Dhruti. And Dhruti can also be classified into three types.\n\nEach one of us who is seeking happiness is consistently trying to be happy. See, it's not that nobody will be blamed for not trying to be happy. So if you ask anybody in this world, no matter what his position is, what his caste is, what his creed is, what's the goal of your life? Have you ever tried to be happy? And the answer is, of course I'm trying. Every day, every minute of my life, I'm trying to be happy.\n\nI'm very consistent in finding my happiness. But how many of us are successful? The statistics are not so good. The Bhagawan says, that's because this dhruti with which you're finding your happiness also comes in three varieties. Drutya, Yaya, Dharayate Manah, Prana, Indriya, Kriya Yogena or Vyabicharynya Dhruti Sapartha Satviki. Swamiji says, and many commentators believe that Dhruti is very loosely translated in English language.\n\nBecause the essence of the word Dhruti cannot be translated without understanding it. Dhruti is fortitude -- in other words, grit, an inner strength, a force from my inner personality which will not let me give up. The things which I consider are important to me. I'm trying to achieve something. We know this world will throw some obstacles in my path. It will all dependent on how strong I am in pursuing my goal.\n\nWhen I encounter great difficulties, I'll evaluate my situation. My Buddhi will say, I don't think it's worth it. We will weigh the pros and cons of this situation and say, what are my risk and reward here? Depending on what I come up with, I say, well, it's not worth pursuing it. Or I'll say, well, risk is not that great. Reward may be great, let's pursue it.\n\nPrabhagawan said, that's Buddhi. Beyond this Buddhi, there is an inner strength which no matter what the circumstances are, will make me pursue my path. Bhagawan says that dhruti. He said that dhruti also can be of three types. The first one is Dhruti, which by the power of yoga will control my manah, Pranaha and Indriyaha. That inner force which by the power of yoga.\n\nBecause I had been pursuing this path and I have seen the glimpse of my own self, I know that all the things which I associate with this Prakriti is temporary. And therefore it will allow me to control my mind, my vital functions and my senses. We know how the world of actions works. Senses go out and get the information about the objects in this world. Mind decides whether it wants to pursue it or not. Intellect will guide the mind whether it is worth performing that action or not.\n\nMy tendency will override whatever my Buddhi will tell me to do. The Bhagavan says that force from my inner self which will let me control my mind. I control the mind, I control my senses. It also control my intellect. So Bhagavan said that Dhrutti which allows me to control my mind, vital functions and senses is Satvik Dhruti. I'm firmly established in what is the truth.\n\nAnd therefore it is allowing me to pursue my path to stay connected with my truth is the Satvik Dhruti. Next one is Yayatu Dharma Kama, Artha Dharayate, Arjunah, Prasangayana, Falakangsi, Dhruti, Sapaarta Rajasi. This one we can relate to very easily. The Bhagavanta Dhrutti which is allowing me to pursue my Dharma, Artha and Kama by Prasangena by attachment. Attachment to my Dharma, attachment to my Kama and attachment of Artha Falakaan. Because I want to get something out of it.\n\nI am pursuing my Dharma as whatever you put it, as an architect, as a father. Because I want results out of that. So I'm firmly pursuing my path of being an architect. I want to continue practicing it. Why I want something out of it. I'm attached to my Dharma.\n\nMost people, if you take their profession away from them, they feel completely lost. They don't know who they are. But once it went, I am pursuing my path of Dharma Orthayanaka. The four goals of life we have learned in our scriptures, Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha. The waiting vow is also. There are four steps you take will do things which is in line with my Dharma.\n\nWhatever my Swadharma, whatever is my duties, I'll follow them. I will only be able to sustain my Dharma if I have enough wealth. Narayana also sustained this world by the power of Lakshmi. Take the Lakshmi away from Narayana. Narayana cannot sustain this world. So if I want Artha -- acquiring wealth -- and Kama -- I want to fulfill my desires.\n\nThese three I'm consistently pursuing my life driven by Prasanga and Falakangshi. Because I'm attached to this three. And I want to get results out of them. And Swamiji says the Bhagavan leaves out moksha because typically we are not really interested in moksha simply because I think the happiness will be in pursuing these three.",
      "reflection": "These verses complete the classification of buddhi and introduce dhriti (fortitude). Rajasic buddhi imperfectly understands dharma and adharma, what should be done and avoided (verse 31) - it has some discrimination but inconsistently applied. Tamasic buddhi, shrouded in darkness, mistakes adharma for dharma and sees everything in reverse (verse 32). This is perhaps the most dangerous state - not ignorance that knows itself as ignorance, but ignorance that believes itself to be knowledge. When wrong seems right and right seems wrong, one is deeply lost.\n\nVerse 33 introduces sattvic dhriti - the unwavering steadfastness that maintains control over mind, prana, and senses through yoga. Dhriti is more than willpower; it is the inner force that keeps one on the path despite obstacles. Swamiji emphasizes that dhriti cannot be adequately translated - it combines fortitude, grit, persistence, and inner strength. This quality enables one to continue when the intellect calculates that the effort is not worth it. Beyond rational assessment lies dhriti, which says \"this is my path, and I will walk it.\"\n\nReflect on your own dhriti: When obstacles arise, what keeps you going? Is it stubbornness (tamasic), desire for results (rajasic), or genuine commitment to the path regardless of outcomes (sattvic)? Today, identify one area where your resolve has weakened. Rather than forcing yourself through willpower alone, connect with the deeper \"why\" - the yoga that naturally sustains effort. Sattvic dhriti does not come from gritting your teeth but from being established in truth. When your path aligns with your deepest nature, persistence becomes effortless."

      "reflection": "Rajasic dhriti (verse 34) persistently pursues dharma, kama, and artha - duty, desire, and wealth - but prasangena and phalakankshi, with attachment and craving for results. This describes most dedicated professionals: persistent and hardworking, but bound by attachment to outcomes. Swamiji notes that Bhagavan leaves moksha out of the rajasic list because we typically are not interested in liberation - we believe happiness lies in successfully pursuing duty, desire, and wealth. Tamasic dhriti (verse 35) clings to sleep, fear, grief, depression, and pride - a stubbornness that perpetuates suffering rather than overcoming it.\n\nVerse 36 introduces the final element: sukha (happiness/pleasure), which also comes in three types. Krishna promises that with proper practice (abhyasa), one can find happiness that ends all suffering (duhkhantam). This is crucial - the Gita does not dismiss our pursuit of happiness but redirects it. Every being seeks happiness; the question is what kind and through what means. Understanding the threefold nature of happiness helps us choose wisely.\n\nExamine your persistence today: What keeps you going in your work and relationships? Is it attachment to results (rajasic) or something deeper? When you pursue Dharma, is it from genuine understanding or from social pressure? When you seek wealth, is it from need or greed? The rajasic person is not wrong to pursue these goals but remains bound by attachment. Today, practice holding your goals more lightly. Continue your efforts with full commitment, but experiment with releasing the grip on specific outcomes. Notice whether this loosening actually improves or diminishes your effectiveness."

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 18, Moksha Sannyasa Yoga -- Yoga of Liberation through Renunciation. We had been discussing all throughout the chapter that this renunciation is about the sense of doership. Right now I have this sense of doership which makes me a doer. Therefore I am bound by my own actions. But once you renounce that doership in knowledge that my true self is not the doer and therefore it's all related to the actions which I perform in this life. So we have seen the entire chapter discussing the quality of actions and how the actions are performed.\n\nIt also says that if I'm not attached to my actions, if I do not have ego and my Buddhi is not tainted, then even if I kill, I do not kill and I'm not bound by my actions. So the bondage is because of my doership in all the actions that I perform. So therefore we have seen the physiology of action and the three things are important. Knowledge of the field actor and then the act of acting which is action itself. These three we have discussed in detail that they are affected by the qualities of the Prakriti. Prakriti we normally translate in English as nature.\n\nSo you can apply that. What is the nature of my knowledge, nature of my actions and nature of my own self will affect the outcome of this actions. And we have seen because they are part of the Prakriti, they are affected by the Sattva Rajasav Thomas. So the knowledge can be Sattvic, Rajasic, or Tamasic. The Karta can be Sattvic, Rajasic, or Tamasic. Therefore the actions will be Sattvic, Rajasic, or Tamasic.\n\nAnd then we have seen that this is driven by the Buddhi and Dhruti. What kind of actions I will perform is dependent on my Buddhi. So I have a Sattvic Buddhi. I will be performing Sattvic actions because Buddhi is the guiding factor. Buddhi as we have seen is the Reservoir of all my experiences in memory that creates my tendencies. The Buddhi will finally decide whether it's to be done or not to be done based on what I have considered it to be.\n\nMy duties, my past experiences, the outcomes which I had in the past -- the Buddhi, depending on my past experiences and their outcomes, can be Sattvic, Rajasic, or Tamasic. No action can be successful unless there is dhruti, fortitude, persistent efforts. So what kind of a Dhruti I have will also be affecting my outcome of my actions. So we have seen that dhruti, the fortitude or grit can also be of three types. Even the person who is trying to rob a bank, he also need the fortitude.\n\nYou know, he may fail. One time he goes there first time he figures out that this is not the right time. He goes back again and again till he finds the right time to rob the bank. So this Dhruti also can be of a Rajasik, Satvik or Tamasic. We have seen that these five are connected -- three causes of actions and two supporters: the Buddhi and Dhruti, which make the action possible.\n\nThey all can be Sattvik, Rajasik or Tamasic. Now you can see the permutation combinations of all this. There are myriads of variations of actions that we see in this world. But the reason we all act is one and the same. We all want happiness. So this Sukha which comes out of these actions can also be of three types.\n\nNow Sukha can be translated in English as \"comfortable\" -- I'm comfortable, I'm a Sukhi. I'm a Dukhi -- unhappy or not comfortable. So Sukha is either comfort or joy or happiness. Any of these words can be associated with the word Sukha. In Sanskrit there are two words: Sukha and Ananda. What is the difference between Sukha and Ananda is what we obviously were trying to figure out. But in this case it says Sukha is the goal for all my actions.\n\nBecause Sukha I associate with happiness. Comfort I associate with happiness. The word Sukha originated from the word for the space for the axle in a chariot. \"Su\" means good, \"kha\" means space. Sukham -- good space for the axle of the chariot. Duhkham -- not so good space. In other words, if the hole in that chariot wheel is perfectly round, it is Sukham.\n\nIf it is not perfectly round, it is Duhkham. The ride will be comfortable if the axle is perfectly balanced in its space and there is no room for it to wobble. Then your ride will be comfortable. So that comfortable ride is associated with Sukham. Duhkham will be a not very comfortable ride because the space for the axle is not perfect.\n\nSo this sukhum is associated with comfort that I experience in life. So the comfort actually relates to the outside environment. If temperature is right in this room, it is comfortable. Temperature is too high or too low, somebody will start complaining. So it relates to the outside condition. My happiness or my comfort is dependent on the outside environment.\n\nThat Sukham is generally associated with your outside conditions. I was watching one of these interviews with Bill Gates and somebody asked him, \"Do you relate your wealth with happiness?\" And he said, \"Yes, I think wealth does give happiness. I don't have to worry about health care costs or anything like that.\" He right away related that to other people's problems, because their conditions are not as comfortable as his.\n\nIt is because of his wealth that he didn't have to worry about the normal things people have to worry about. So Sukha is typically about the outside condition. Joy or Ananda is the state of mind. Happiness is a state of mind. It can exist in a Sukhi or Dukhi condition. The outside condition may not be comfortable, but I may still be happy.\n\nSukha and Duhkha, when they relate to the body, mind, and intellect, are obviously related to the outcome of my efforts. So this verse defines three types of Sukha which are the results of my actions. Sukha also can be of three types. I'm acting in this world so that my life is comfortable and I achieve happiness. Why do you want to be comfortable?\n\nBecause I want to be happy. In the end it's all about happiness. We know happiness is a state of mind. Somehow if my mind feels that it's the perfect condition then it will be happy. Till that time it will keep complaining. I may have the best car, but that's not the car I wanted.\n\nI wanted something else. Well, I'm not really happy. Sukham Tvidanim Trividham Shrunu Me Bharatarshabha. Listen, Sukha can be of three types. Sukha is also not common to all. Our standard example is smoking.\n\nThat which gives Sukha to one person, gives the guy sitting next to him discomfort. So Sukha is also personal, depending on my tendencies and my likings and my dislikings. Abhyasad Ramate Yatra Duhkhantam Cha Nigacchati. But if you practice properly, this Sukha can lead to the end of Duhkha. If you figure out what is the cause of your Duhkha and work towards it, Sukha leads to the end of Duhkha. That's all this verse says. The verse says there are three types of Sukha.\n\nAnd if you're intelligent enough to find out what is the cause of your Duhkha, then you can end that Duhkha. But my problem is something else, and I'm working on something else. It's like having a stomach ache but hitting my head. If the cause of my Duhkha is something else but I keep trying to fix other things, it will not help.\n\nTherefore he said Abhyasat Ramate Yatra Duhkhantam Cha Nigacchati. With constant practice of figuring out what Duhkha is and how to avoid it, Bhagavan Buddha finally figured out what the cause of all these Duhkhas in this world is. He said, well, no matter what the situation, everybody's unhappy -- somebody's sick, somebody's old, somebody's poor. And he finally found one universal cause for all Duhkha. He said desire is the cause for all Duhkha. If you get rid of desire, all Duhkha will go away.\n\nSo Bhagavan said, you should understand the nature of Sukha also. Just because it is comfortable, it will not give you happiness. Yat Agre Visham Eva Pariname Amritopamam Tatsukham Sattvikam Proktam Atma Buddhi Prasadajam. Every word is important here to understand. So it says that Sattvic Sukha is that which is compared to poison (Visham) in the beginning -- so difficult, like climbing Mount Everest. I don't know why people do it.\n\nI have never figured it out. Something which you consider Sukha, and if you want to achieve that, you have to go through hell. The road to heaven passes through hell. Bhagavan said that which is in the beginning like poison but in the end like nectar -- that is Sattvic Sukha.\n\nBut where does it come from? It says Atma Buddhi Prasadajam. It comes as a Prasad from your Buddhi which is established in yourself. One who has realized his own true nature -- that Buddhi will give you a Prasad. As we use the word Prasad in our day-to-day language, when you go to the temple and do puja, at the end there is a Prasad. Now this Prasad is not really guaranteed by my efforts.\n\nBecause it's up to the pujari -- whatever the Prasad, whether I get a banana or a mango. Meena said that her eye was on the mango. But then the pujari asked the first person, \"Whatever fruit you want, take one from here.\" That person took the mango. If you are given a choice, it's not really Prasad. Prasad is to be given.\n\nSwamiji used to say, you go to the temple and just accept the Prasad. Prasad is to be given, never taken. Prasad is something which is not in my control. It comes as a result of my efforts automatically. So that Prasad of integrating my Buddhi with the truth -- what comes out of it is the Prasad of that integration.\n\nSo the Buddhi which is established in the self, which gives you Prasad in the form of Sukha and bliss -- Bhagavan says that's Sattvic Sukha. But to get to that point was like poison. All the efforts that you put in to figure out what your true self is, going through all the experiences in life. When Buddha went through all these experiences in his life, he went from one teacher to another. He left his kingdom, left his wife, left his child, meditated for years. Finally, under the Bodhi tree, he realized what the real nature of the truth is.\n\nThen he achieved the bliss. Bhagavan said that the Sukha which is obtained after vigorous efforts gives the most satisfaction. Because if you earned your Sukha, then that will give you the most happiness. If you have come to that final point of integrating your mind and intellect so that they recognize yourself, that Sukha will be permanent. And therefore it is Sattvic. In contrast to that: Vishayendriya Samyogat Yat Tad Agre Amritopamam, Pariname Visham Iva Tat Sukham Rajasam Smritam.\n\nBut that which is very pleasant in the beginning, because it is born out of contact of sense organs with the sense objects -- nice silky clothes, a nice bed -- those things give you happiness because of the contact of the sense organs with the sense objects, which feels like nectar in the beginning.",
      "reflection": "These verses present the profound teaching on the three types of happiness. Sattvic sukha (verse 37) is like poison in the beginning but nectar in the end - it arises from atma-buddhi-prasada, the clarity and grace of an intellect established in the Self. The metaphor is perfect: spiritual discipline, study, and self-inquiry can feel arduous initially, but they lead to lasting fulfillment. Rajasic sukha (verse 38) is the opposite - like nectar at first when senses contact sense objects, but poison in the end. This describes most worldly pleasures: immediately gratifying but ultimately depleting.\n\nThe word sukha itself is revealing - it originally meant \"good space\" for the chariot axle, creating a smooth, comfortable ride. Duhkha is \"bad space\" - a rough, uncomfortable journey. Sukha relates to external conditions, while ananda (bliss) is an inner state independent of circumstances. We constantly confuse the two, seeking lasting happiness through adjusting external conditions rather than establishing inner stability.\n\nToday, observe your pursuit of happiness: Are you seeking sattvic sukha that builds over time, or rajasic sukha that provides immediate gratification but leaves you emptier than before? Notice one pleasure you regularly pursue and honestly assess its trajectory - does it lead to greater peace or greater craving? Challenge yourself to choose one sattvic practice that feels difficult now - meditation, study, discipline - and commit to it not for immediate pleasure but trusting that it becomes like nectar over time. The teaching promises that what seems like poison initially transforms into lasting fulfillment."

      "commentary": "Chapter 18, Moksha Sanyasa Yoga. This is obviously the last chapter in our studies of Bhagavad Gita. So we had been systematically studying Bhagavad Gita. The goal of that is to figure out how I should act in this world so that I can get the maximum happiness. So we have first understood who we are in the Bhagavad Gita as individuals, how we function in this world. And then we have also talked about who is that?\n\nWho has the control over this entire universe and therefore also over my life. We are coming to the end portion of the Bhagavad Gita. We are synthesizing this knowledge about who we are at the individual level. What is my relationship with this world and the Supreme Being? But the bottom line still remains, how can I be happy? So in this chapter we are analyzing the factors affecting my actions and the outcome of my actions.\n\nSo in the beginning, Arjun asked what is sannyas and what is thyaga? Because in all this discussion I picked up these two words which ultimately lead to happiness, ultimately leads you to liberation, freedom from all the sorrows and unhappiness. So I want to understand these two concepts so I can find out how I can act in this world. Number one, very simply said, giving up all desire prompted actions is Sanyas. If you can reach a point where you don't have to do anything to satisfy your desires, then you are a sannyasi. That can only happen when I have exhausted all the desire.\n\nThere is no desire left. Therefore I don't have to act for my desires. That can only happen if I have no ego and no individual identification. Sarva Karma Falatyagama stagger. That seems like the goal one can strive for that I can probably work on Tyaga part. But because the Tyaga can be misunderstood, giving up, abandoning something can be misunderstood.\n\nWe went into discussion about this. Tyaga also can be of three types. This Prakriti has three qualities, so anything associated with the Prakriti will have the same Triguna. We used the example before that every gold ornament will have the same ingredient of gold. Gold ornaments also come in different carats -- 18 carat versus 16 carat, 12 carat, 24 carat.\n\nWhat that means is something else is mixed into the gold. You cannot make an ornament out of pure gold; they have to add zinc. The proportion of that metal can change, but every gold ornament will have both gold and zinc, which makes it more malleable, more workable. It is the proportion which makes it 12 carat vs 18 carat vs 24 carat. Prakriti is also like that.\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind is I should give up all my actions. So we reaffirmed that action cannot be given up by anybody. It is not possible for a living being to completely abandon all actions. Therefore, now we need to understand what actions are to be abandoned. In the beginning, Bhagawan gave an indication -- desire prompted actions. So what actions should I perform?\n\nYajna Dana Tapa should not be given up at any cost. The actions which are purifying your mind and intellect, they should be performed. And then we talked about the anatomy of action, because we are going to be focused on actions all our life. We are going to be focusing on how I should act in the right manner and what actions are to be abandoned. We looked at three propellers of actions.\n\nThe knowledge, Gnanam, Gnem, Parignatha -- the knowledge, the knower, and the knowable. We also looked at Karanam, Karma, Karta, iti, Trivedha, Karma, Sangraha. Action only comes into existence if these three are there: the instrument of action, the doer, and the action itself. Then we analyzed that Gnana, Karma, and Karta also can be of three types.\n\nAnything which is part of the Prakriti will have the same three ingredients in different proportions. Gnana, Karma, and Karta also come in three types. We also discussed Buddhi and Dhruti -- the foundation of any action, my intellect and my fortitude. These basically make any action possible, or rather, success in any action possible. Even those two can come in three different varieties.\n\nAnd in the end our goal was to get Sukham, happiness or Ananda. See this Sukha also can be three types. Sattvik, Sukha, which is at the beginning seems like a poison. But in the end it is like a nectar. Work hard to get somewhere. But when you get there, there is joy there.\n\nSo that's a Sattvik sukha. It seems good in the beginning, but in the end it gives pain. That's Rajasik sukha. So the pleasures in life which we pursue, they are like Rajasik sukha. It gives you some joy, but in the end it gives you unhappiness. Even going on vacation -- every time you come back, you say, \"I'm tired, I can't do anything.\"\n\nI need a vacation from my vacation, you know. So every pleasure which we seek in the end it ends them into some kind of a misery. So the Bhagawan says, that's Rajasik sukha. It starts as very pleasant, ends in unpleasantness. And Tamasik sukha? It is not enjoyable in the beginning, and also not enjoyable in the end.\n\nScratching, for example -- when we start, it's not really that pleasant. And after you are done with it, it is also very painful. This is why Bhagavan said that's Tamasik sukha. And then we are coming to the segment where Bhagavan said, therefore now understand that everything in this Prakriti is made up of these three gunas. So human beings are also affected by these three gunas. These three gunas affect all the people we come across and ourselves.\n\nAnd based on those gunas, they can be also classified into Sattvik, Rajasic and Tamasic. But we may get confused. The Bhagawan makes it clear that it is not possible for anything or any being in this Prakriti to be without these three gunas. All three gunas have to be present for a thing or being to exist in space and time. For something to exist in space and time, it has to have inertia. Without inertia, the thing simply cannot persist -- otherwise it vanishes the moment it's created.\n\nSomebody gave an example -- I think it was Swamiji who gave a story of Brahmaji when he first created human beings. They were all completely Sattvik. As soon as Brahmaji created them, they all went back to their true nature. Brahmaji was really baffled.\n\nHow can I keep this thing stable? The inertia tamas makes things remain in this time and space. But the thing also cannot remain what it is. And it rajast with activities. We now know from science that even atom which seems stable has intense activity in it. All electrons are circling around that neutral proton.\n\nAnd the thing needs to know that it exists, which is Sattva. So Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas -- I exist, I act, and I remain in my place. These three are absolutely necessary for anything or any being to be in existence. So the verses which we are coming to now clarify: Na tad asthi prithivyam va divi deveshu va punah Sattvam prakritei muktaha yat yabhi sha tribhirgunaihi -- on this earth and also in the heavens among Devas, there is not a single being who is free from all these three gunas. Thinking of yourself without these three gunas is not possible. But at the same time, we keep hearing Bhagavan say Guna teet Bhava Arjuna.\n\nWe probably understood that I should go beyond this guna, so I should get rid of all three gunas. Bhagawan said that is not possible. You can stop identifying with this Guna. So my mind is working in Tamasic mode or Rajasic mode. I should be able to introspect and say it's my mind which is a rajasic mode. If I can make him go to Sattvic mode, it will be more comfortable.\n\nBut if I identify with my mind, am I obviously identifying with my mind and intellect? So you can be Gunateet only if you are not identifying with your limited self. Bhagavan said, be clear that these three gunas are present in all beings -- divine beings and also the mortals on this planet. They all are affected by these three gunas. And therefore all humanity and all beings can be classified into Sattvik, Rajasik, and Tamasik depending on their predominant qualities. Brahman, Kshatriya, Vishyam, Shudranamcha, Parantpa, Karmani, Pravibakthani, Swabhava, Prabhavai Gunai.\n\nThis is basically a clarification for all of us who have this confusion about what is this caste system. Bhagavan created Brahman, Vishyanshudra and therefore now you are bound by this divisions. It clearly says that Karmani, Pravibakthani, Swabhava, Prabhavai Gunaihe. Their duties are divided among this Brahmakshatriya, Vaishna Sudra for their own nature, Prabhavayi Gunai hi. According to their own nature, their duties are determined for Brahma, Vaishya, Kshudra and Kshatriya. So it is your own nature which makes you Brahman or Kshatri or Shudra or Vaishya.\n\nBhagavan makes it clear here: it is not by birth, not by association, not by caste, creed, or color, but by the texture of your mind and intellect. Your gunas will make you the Brahma, Kshatriya, Vishya, or Sudra. Shamah, Damah, Tapaha, Shaucham, Kshantihi, Arjamam, Evacha, Gnanam, Vignanam, Astikyam, Brahma Karma, Swabhavajam. First he said their duties in life are attributed to them according to their own nature. You have to give a person work or his place in your company, in your society and community based on what his aptitude is. That's why before going to college you take an aptitude test. Even in a company, two engineers come.\n\nOne may be more research oriented and other may be more practical oriented. You put them in right place. In our profession it is much more clearer that we are all architects. But some are more design oriented so they can design, some more creative. Some are more technical minded so they can put things together in a building a little better. And some are more into administrative.\n\nMake sure that things are done right. So we used to have three divisions in companies. There used to go to design department, Production department and Construction Administration department. Suppose more glamorous because it's creative. But depending on your aptitude, you end up going from one to the another. Sometimes, even if you don't have the aptitude, you think, \"Because design is more glamorous, I want to go there.\"\n\nBut then you would be miserable because you won't be able to perform your task properly. Eventually you end up going where your aptitude is whether you like it or not. Bhagawan said that the duties are distributed among them according to their own gunas. Now how do I know what gunas Bhagavan says know what Brahmana's qualities are? Shamaha, control over the mind, mental control, Shamah Dhammah, physical control, control over your senses, Tapaha austerity. Any discipline which you follow, Shaucham, purity, Shantihi, forgiveness, Arjvam, straightforwardness.\n\nWhatever it is, you can see clearly: Gnanam, Vignanam -- knowledge and also applied knowledge, the application of knowledge. Astikyam -- faith in the underlying truth that this world has its basis. We have learnt in Bhagavad Gita before that those people who are of devilish qualities think there is no basis in this world. The Bhagawan says Astikyam, that faith in the underlying truth, the underlying reality in this nature -- Brahma Karma Swabhavajam. This comes naturally to Brahmins. In other words, the people who have these qualities are the Brahmins. Now, say you identified that you are that person.\n\nYou ask him to run a business. Obviously he is not good at it. So you can't really put somebody in charge of something he is not good at.",
      "reflection": "Verse 40 makes a universal declaration: nothing in this world, neither on earth nor among the celestial beings, is free from the three gunas born of Prakriti. This is both humbling and liberating. Humbling because no one can claim to be beyond these qualities while living in a body. Liberating because it means we should not despair at finding these tendencies in ourselves - they are the nature of existence. The goal is not elimination but transcendence through dis-identification.\n\nVerses 41-42 begin describing the four varnas based on svabhava-prabhava-guna - qualities born of one's own nature. This is not a birth-based caste system but a recognition that people have different temperaments and aptitudes. The Brahmana qualities are listed: shama (serenity), dama (self-control), tapa (austerity), saucha (purity), kshanti (forgiveness), arjava (straightforwardness), jnana (knowledge), vijnana (applied wisdom), and astikyam (faith in the underlying reality). These are not inherited but developed through inner work.\n\nReflect honestly: Which qualities from the Brahmana list do you embody naturally, and which require effort? The teaching is not that everyone should become a Brahmana but that everyone should discover and fulfill their own svadharma (inherent nature). Today, identify one quality from this list that you want to develop. Rather than forcing it, ask: What in my life is obstructing this quality? Shama (serenity) is obstructed by constant stimulation. Arjava (straightforwardness) is obstructed by fear of consequences. Address the obstruction, and the quality naturally emerges."

      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 18 and we have so far analyzed the actions, knowledge and the actor. Now, as we have seen, everything is kind of classified into three classes depending on the qualities of the actions, knowledge or the actors. Now we are going into the classification of human beings. We also classified the Sukha, the happiness or the pleasure which comes from your actions. Actions are performed for as we said and discussed many times for two purposes only. One is to gain happiness and other is to avoid unhappiness.\n\nThere are actions we perform simply to make sure that there is no sorrow. Your retirement planning for avoiding sorrow in the future, when I'm not working, I'm not able to work. I need planning for my retirement. That's for avoiding unhappiness. But I am accumulating money to buy a BMW to get happiness. So there are two reasons we work in this world.\n\nWe have identified those. The happiness that comes out of these actions can also be either sattvic happiness. It may take very painful efforts in the beginning, but in the end it will be like nectar. Or it will feel like nectar now, but in the end it turns out to be more painful. Or the last one we have seen is something which in the beginning it is painful, in the end also painful. But I do it because I think that's the only way I can get some comfort.\n\nSo now why people act in this manner? The next few verses which we will see said, we are all driven by our qualities. So Bhagavan vastu, pravartate, Beings and things in this world are driven by their own qualities. So if you ask me to go for football match, no matter how hard you try, unless there is some other temptation you give, I won't go to football match. As I said when I was in Dallas, we will have all the social party football matches. The temptation was all the socializing and the food and friends.\n\nFootball was least of my concern because it's not in my nature. But you have a music party. I will stay hungry if I need to sing. Obviously you can't really sing with a full stomach. So I'll be the last one to eat while everybody has left. Because I want to make sure that I am at my best when my turn comes to sing.\n\nSo I'm sacrificing something for which my own nature says it's pleasurable. So the next few verses it says. nastih prathivyam vyam va divi deveshu va punah sattvam prakruti jai Muktam Yadebhi sat tribhirgunaih. Now first thing they say, well, if I understood all that, I'm going to get rid of all the Tamas. I'm going to get rid of all the Rajas. I'll be just Sattvik.\n\nBhagavan said, it is really not possible that there is no being on this earth or again in the heaven. It's our conception that we are the mortal beings on this planet earth and they are immortal beings or devas are in the heaven. These Devas, even you know, Purana says they also have their qualities. Some devas are angry, some manipulate, some do this, you know, that's all the Pura Puranic stories. So it says, there is no being, whether a human being or a divine being, Deva, who is totally liberated from the three qualities. One cannot get rid of these three qualities totally.\n\nBecause once you liberate from these Gunas, you're out of the Prakriti, you're out of Maya. These three gunas are the characteristics of Maya, the Prakriti, the manifest world. As long as you are part of the manifest world as a being, these three has to be there. All these three has to be there to make you a being in this world. Therefore, Bhagavan said, there is no being on this planet or anywhere else in this universe who can be liberated completely from these three gunas. The day you transcend all three gunas, there is no Gita class, there is no you, there is no I.\n\nOnly the supreme self who was never tainted by this Prakriti remains. So the next verse says Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishyam, Shudranamcha, Parantapa, Karmani, pravibhaktani, svabhava, prabhavaih, gunaih. This is not a social commentary on Indian caste system. Bhagavad Gita was written before the caste system had been polluted by social thinking and historical influences. So this is not a social commentary. Let's not get confused with what happened in India over the last few thousand years regarding the caste system or Varanashram. It simply says Brahmanakshatriya, Vishyam, Shudranamcha, Parantapa Karmani, Pravibhaktani, svabhava, Prabhaivi Gunehi.\n\nWhatever the predominant quality in a being, their karmas are assigned accordingly. If my aptitude is to sing, but then you say no, there is no singing here. You're going to dance today. Obviously that's not really something I can do. And that happens to me all the time. We go to a party and then everybody starts dancing.\n\nAnd I'm the one who has no real interest at all. But why you are not dancing? Because I don't like dancing. That's why I'm not dancing. So Bhagavan said that each one's actions karma is assigned as per the predominant Gunas. The Brahman, Rakshatriya, Vaishyam or Rakshudra.\n\nNow these classifications are not based on what we understand today; they are based on the Gunas. And we tend to conveniently forget that Bhagavan has already said in the Bhagavad Gita: Chaturvarnam, Maya Shrushta Guna, Karma, Vibhaga Saha. Depending on their gunas, their qualities and their actions, I have created four types of people in this world. I'm not a Brahmin and you are not a Shudra. Everybody in this country of 250 million people or so has equal right.\n\nThe citizens I'm talking about has equal right to be a president of this country. How many in this class wants to be a president of this country? We have no desire to be that. We have no qualities to become one. Does that mean I don't have a right to become a president? You have every right to become a president.\n\nThe other day we were at the India festival and Tim Kaine came. Obviously we kind of know him from our association all these years. So we took Medha and had a picture with Tim Kaine. And I said, \"Senator Kaine, this is the newest member in our family -- the future senator of Virginia.\" From his perspective, a child can only aspire to become another senator. But Medha will become exactly what her Guna Karma is. So Bhagavan said, the Prakriti has created four types of beings at least in the human race with their qualities and their actions are assigned accordingly.\n\nI told you, in our architecture firm we're all architects. We come out of architecture college. But then some have a design tendency on the technical side, some are more on the nitty gritty type -- construction and details. And some are purely management. Now if you take one type and assign them the other's work, it's always a disaster. So even though we have abolished the system of design department, production department, we still assign work according to their tendencies.\n\nDoes that mean we are discriminating? No, we are just trying to make people more comfortable in their ability to produce work. So Bhagavan says Brahmanakshatriya Vishaam Sudranam Chaparantapa Karmani Pravibhaktani. So Bhava prabhavaih gunai hi. All these people have own tendencies and the work is distributed in the society according to their qualities born of their own nature, not just somebody instilled by force. There is a lot of social injustice in this world, but that's not what Bhagavad Gita is about.\n\nBhagavad Gita makes a statement of facts. How we understand these facts and utilize -- or misuse -- them is a matter of our shortcomings and ignorance. So the next verse says Shamah damah Tapaha Shaucham shanti arjavam Gnanam Vignanam Astikyam Brahma Karma svabhavajam Long list. These are the qualities of the scholarly class thinking class in any society whether it is Indian, tribal or somewhere in some distant planet. More evolved society than human beings. Every society in this age or in Rama's age was divided by people who have tendency to be more thinking, contemplating type, knowledge oriented. Those people who have these qualities -- serenity, self-restraint, austerity, purity, forgiveness, and also uprightness, knowledge, realization of what is right and wrong.\n\nRealization of what is my true self and what is my non-self. Belief in God -- Brahma Astikyam -- having faith that there is some higher self than this limited self. The Astikyam, Brahma Karma, Svabhavajam -- these are the qualities of the Brahmanas. It does not say the one who was born in a Brahmana family or falls into a Brahmana caste. It simply says that the group of people in any society who have these qualities fall into this type of activity because of their evolution in their intellectual pursuit.\n\nWhat I know in architecture today is a lot more than I knew in the 1970s. My constant working in that field has given me more and more knowledge. Does that mean that because we should have equal rights, I have to give up my knowledge and act like the guy who comes out of architecture school?\n\nNo, this is with my own effort I have achieved a status which is higher than the guy who comes out of architecture school today. So by their own efforts and evolution the people have achieved the state where they have developed these qualities. And we have seen all we are doing is working in our inner equipment through our actions. There are some actions which purify my inner equipment. There are some actions which will pollute my inner equipment. If my actions were consistently to purify my inner equipment I would have developed these qualities.\n\nAnd those who have done that, they are the Brahmanas. In any society, the next category we discuss is Sauryam Tejo Dhrutihi Daksham Yudde Chapyapalayanam Dhanam Ishwara Bhavasta, Kshatram Karma Svabhavajam. There are people who are scholarly and who have, through the evolution of their mind and intellect, reached a point of serenity and clarity where they can see things as they are. Therefore, in all our Puranas, the king has to go to the Rajguru and ask for advice. Because the king, in his passion, may not see what is right or wrong -- whether to attack that next territory or not. He goes to the Rajguru and asks his counsel.\n\nThe Rajguru, because he's not attached, can see things as they are and say, \"This is good for you,\" or \"This is not good for you.\" This is right or wrong. Because he's devoid of the passion with the King. So the next group of people in any society are the Kshatriyas. We know by now that the Brahmanas do the scholarly work.\n\nKshatriyas do the political work and protection and administering the country or the kingdom. So their qualities should be prowess, splendor, firmness, dexterity. And also not fleeing from battle -- the battle of life. Some of us run away from any situation when it is threatening, and some will face it head on. The quality of Kshatriya is to face that situation head on. Generosity, lordliness, leadership.\n\nToday we call it leadership qualities. I was part of this leadership Metro Richmond group and so was Rajesh. We want to develop leaders in this community so that they can take this community to the next level. I attended one of the seminars and the guy said something which really I thought was pretty neat. He said, do not work in your business, you have to work on your business. See, my staff works in my business.\n\nI need to be constantly working on my business in a sense that I. I need to have foresight.",
      "reflection": "The qualities of Kshatriyas (verse 43) include shaurya (valor), teja (brilliance), dhriti (steadfastness), dakshya (skill), apalayana (not fleeing from battle), dana (generosity), and ishvara-bhava (lordly bearing or leadership). For Vaishyas (verse 44): agriculture, cattle-rearing, and trade. For Shudras: service. This framework recognizes that different temperaments are suited to different contributions. The key teaching is svabhava-jam - these duties arise from one's own nature, not external imposition.\n\nVerse 45 delivers the crucial promise: sve sve karmani abhirata samsiddhim labhate narah - devoted to one's own duty, a person attains perfection. This is revolutionary: perfection (siddhi) comes not from abandoning your field for a supposedly higher one, but from complete dedication to whatever naturally suits you. A devoted janitor attains the same spiritual perfection as a devoted scholar. The path to liberation is through work, not around it.\n\nExamine your relationship with your work today: Are you doing what naturally suits your temperament, or are you in a field chosen for prestige, family pressure, or financial considerations? If you cannot change your external circumstances, can you change your internal orientation? Even within unsuitable work, find the aspect that aligns with your nature. The teaching promises that wholehearted dedication to one's own dharma - whatever that may be - leads to samsiddhi, complete fulfillment. Where in your current work can you bring more wholehearted presence today?"

      "commentary": "Chapter 18, Moksha Sannyasa Yoga. Yoga of Liberation through Renunciation. We have discussed what this chapter is all about. You can see it as a summary or the final recommendations. You can see it like a summary of a long report. You're trying to make sense out of it without reading the whole thing.\n\nIf you just read a summary before the full report, you might hear different interpretations about what's right. Similarly here, if you just read chapter 18 by itself, it probably won't make any sense to you. But if you read the entire Bhagavad Gita from chapter one through 17 and then read chapter 18, it should make sense to you. So what we have discussed so far is in Bhagavad Gita, the recommendations are made for your betterment, for your growth, for your happiness in general.\n\nWe have realized that in this world there are people who are different from each other. But each one is striving for the one and the same goal, which is to achieve happiness. Not only just the happiness in a finite term, but infinite term. I want to get happiness which never ends. So we all learned who we are at this limited self, what is our identity, what when we identify with the supreme, and how can we remove this parallax between the limited self and unlimited self to achieve that infinite happiness. So this chapter now brings it back to our attention that what we have discussed.\n\nSo what we have discussed so far is working in this world is absolutely necessary. In this world you will not be able to stand still without acting anything because of our experiences, that anytime I get involved in something and there are conflicts and there are frictions, and therefore it creates unhappiness. Maybe I should stay away from all these things. But that's not the answer, because you just cannot stay without doing anything. So therefore understand what action is all about. You should not give up actions, but act in accordance with the advice in the Sastra, which says that there are actions which are forbidden.\n\nIt is not that you and I have to invent the will all over again every time. We have the wisdom of our ancestors, our civilization, our culture which tells you that stay away from this. This is not going to help you. Just like you tell a child, don't put finger in the fire, you're going to get burnt. Don't put finger in the electrical outlet, you'll get shot. You don't have to try it out to see whether it works or not.\n\nSo the Nishiddha Karma are forbidden -- so that you don't get burnt, you don't get completely destroyed. Now what is left is Nityaattachment and you shall achieve your goal of getting happiness. That's basically a simple advice in the beginning. But then the question occurs that we are all of different temperaments and we all have different goals.\n\nWe act in different fields. Is it really applied to all of us or only apply to the great evolved people who have understood all this philosophy of life? And Bhagavan come to the conclusion, a guideline that no. It applies to all of you. Whether you are at the top of the pyramid or at the bottom of the pyramid in the society. Therefore, we have discussed the four types of people.\n\nThis classification which we have just learned in previous verses says there are four types of people. They are defined by their own nature, their own gunas. It does not say that because you are a Brahmana, these gunas are yours. Rather, because you have these gunas, you'll be considered a Brahmana. You should consider yourself a Kshatriya because you have the following gunas: bravery, valor, brightness, lordliness.\n\nNot the other way around. It's not \"because you are a Kshatriya, you should have these qualities,\" but \"because you have these qualities, you are a Kshatriya.\" And similarly, because you have certain qualities, you are a Vaishya or a Shudra. It did not say that one class is more important than the other. He said it's applicable to all of you.\n\nThe advice given in Bhagavad Gita, whether you are at the lowest rank, at the Shudra level or the Brahmin level, it all will apply to you. So last time somebody asked me, can you make a reference to the Purusha Sukta in Riga Veda. So in Purusha Sukta the same idea is explained. Purusha Sukta starts with Sahastra, Sirisa, Purushaha, Sahastraksha, Sahastrapad. This Purusha is envisioned, is the universal being. If the entire creation is one being, then how will you view it?\n\nOr the sage who saw this universe as one being, he saw him as a being with thousands of eyes and thousands of legs and thousands of mouths. Very similar to what we have learnt in Bhagavad Gita in that vishwarupadas in chapter 11. So he said, this Purusha is everywhere. Sabhumim, Visvatovratva, atyatistha dash Angalam. He's enveloping the entire universe and is spreading in all ten directions. We have discussed before eight cardinal directions.\n\nNorthwest, east, south, northwest, southwest, southeast and northeast. Then eight up and down, 10, he's extending in all 10 directions. And then the question asks, what about his limbs? Brahmano mukha Asita. The first time you hear this Brahmano, Ashya Mukha, Asith, Brahmanas are his mouth. This universal being in his self is envisioned as what coming out of his mouth is Brahmanas.\n\nSo Brahmana, the knowledge speech, what we see is Brahmana, Asya Mukham, Asith, Bahuhu, Rajanya, Kritaha. His arms are made up of Rajanya, Kshatriyas, Uru tadasyat, Vaishyah. His thighs are made up of Vaishyas and Padyam Shudrajaya and his feet are made up of Shudras. The shudras constitute his feet, Vaisyas constitute his thighs, Kshatriyas constitute his arms and Brahmanas his mouth. This being cannot be complete if any one of them. You remove the complete picture of the Supreme Being.\n\nIt cannot be complete if you just take the Brahmanas and say other three are not necessary. He is who he is because all four parts. And then it continues and says Nabya Asid Antariksha. His navel forms the space between the heaven and the earth. Sishnav dyo Samovar Tathaha, his head sustained in heaven. Padma Bhumir Disaha, your feet are sustaining the earth.\n\nNakshatra, Tatha, Lokan Akalbayan and his ears the directions. So basically this one single entity is viewed as encompassing every part of the society, every part of our universe. Brahmanas are his mouth, Kshatriyas are his hands, arms and Vaishyas are his thigh. And shudras are his feet. He's supported by Shudras and Vaishyas. But it is part of the same entity.\n\nSo it's not the intention of the writer of this Purushaktam to put anyone down or so. But basically saying this system just cannot function unless there are all four types of people at any given time, at any given place, in any given society. So therefore we have discussed in this that there are four types of people. You may fall in any one of them depending on your qualities. If you find your qualities to be of service, your Shudra and as we said, entire service sector now today can be part of Shudras. Because we are serving.\n\nServing is the nature of Shudras. Creating wealth is the nature of Vaishyas. If you put the Vaishyas where the Rajanya is supposed to be, that happens. What is happening in USA now? So Bhagawan said that each one has own quality. And when you try to mix each other without understanding, it may create issues and problems.\n\nBut if you understand yourself and where you stand, at least at your level -- this Bhagavad Gita is for self-unfoldment, for individual self-development. So the next four verses, from 45 through 48, are actually the essence of how to be successful. If we forget the entire message of Bhagavad Gita but understand these four verses, contemplate on them, and practice them, Bhagavan guarantees that you will be a happy person and a successful person. These verses are applicable to all four classes of people. Not just for the Brahmins, and not just for Kshatriyas or Vaishyas, but even Kshudras, all four of them.\n\nIf they can stick to this formula of success, then success is guaranteed. That's basically what these four verses are all about. Verse 45, which we have seen, says: devoted to one's own duty, a man attains perfection. Perfection here should not be taken in the ordinary sense. It is the realization that now I have realized what my true self is. Whatever the field you're practicing, if you stay within your own nature, you will achieve perfection in that. If I'm a sweeper, if I focus into it, I'll achieve perfection. I always wonder -- all these people who have a garbage collection company, I mean, at some point the guy had some interest in garbage collection, right? Before he became a big businessman with lots of trucks running around all over Richmond.\n\nYou can't suddenly get interested in garbage collection. I actually had a client one time with one of these recycling businesses. Just passing through his yard -- all junk all around it. Then you go to his office, which is air-conditioned, a nice little office, nice little conference room. But just going through that yard made me realize that this guy must really feel comfortable in this environment. Therefore, he can be a successful businessman trading in this recycling business.\n\nBhagavan said, wherever you feel comfortable, according to your own dharma. If you follow the actions. If you perform actions in your own field of interest. Sansiddhim Labate Naraha person gets success. That's as simple as that. If I try to do something which is not my nature, I may get some success here and there.\n\nBut I'll never get full success. I tried developing some hotels and lost my shirt. But designing hotels I do very well. So after I lost all my investment, I said, let me go back to what I do best. Keep designing for other people. I can give advice to other people.\n\nWhere to build hotels, what is the right location, what will work, what will not work. I tried to do it myself. The Bhagavan said, if you stay within your realm of interest, of your own nature, success is guaranteed. You will achieve success. Swag karma nirataha Siddhim Yatha Vindha di tatsurana. But how that happens?\n\nBhagawan said, I'll tell you now how working in the field of your own interest, one can get. Siddhi -- perfection, success, expertise. And we find in this world all kinds of experts. Every time I come across a new challenge in my profession, something which I never heard about -- somebody says design something and it requires something so unique -- how do I figure this thing out?\n\nAnd then I realize that there are experts even in disaster recovery. Suddenly you find that there are experts in this world who deal with that type of disaster which we have never thought about. How can you have experts in that field when the disaster only occurs once in a while? Because there are people who find their niche and they become experts because they pursue the field of their interest. So Arjuna asks, \"How do they do it?\" Bhagavan says, \"I will explain to you now.\" So the next three verses.\n\nThis simply says how you should view your own field of interest.",
      "reflection": "These verses form what Swamiji calls the \"formula for success\" applicable to all people regardless of their station. Verse 46 reveals how work becomes worship: sva-karmana tam abhyarchya - by worshipping through one's own work, the one from whom all beings arise and by whom all this is pervaded, a person attains siddhi. This transforms every action into a sacred offering. The mechanic worships through perfect repairs; the teacher through patient instruction; the parent through loving care. No action is too mundane when offered to the Source.\n\nVerse 47 repeats the earlier teaching: better is one's own dharma, though imperfect, than another's dharma well-performed. Svabhava-niyatam karma kurvan napnoti kilbisham - performing action determined by one's own nature, one incurs no sin. Verse 48 adds a crucial insight: sahajam karma - innate or natural work - should not be abandoned even if it has defects, because sarvarambha hi doshena - all undertakings are covered with defects as fire is covered by smoke. No work is perfect; waiting for perfect conditions means never acting.\n\nWhat is your sahajam karma - the work that naturally suits you? Today, release the perfectionism that prevents wholehearted engagement. Accept that your work will have defects (like smoke accompanies fire) and offer it anyway. The defects belong to the work; liberation belongs to the attitude. Practice this: before beginning your next task, consciously dedicate it to the Source from which your abilities arise. During the work, stay present rather than projecting to results. After completion, release it - let the outcome unfold without grasping."

      ],
      "commentary": "We had been discussing chapter 18, Moksha Sannyasi Yoga, Yoga of Liberation through renunciation, renunciation of actions. Up till now we have discussed the nature of actions, the nature of actors -- that is, you and I -- and the nature of knowledge. Knowledge that propels my desires, and my desires prompt me to act. And I go and act in this world outside. So we have analyzed how we function in this world. We came to the conclusion that depending on the texture of my mind and intellect, whether it is Sattvik, Rajaseek or Tamasvik that's dependent on my tendencies.\n\nIf my tendencies are Sattvik, I will have Sattvik desires and I will do Sattvik actions. If they are Rajasik, the same applies, and Tamasic appropriately. So my tendencies are driving my actions. And from these actions come reactions from the world, and I react to those, and they become my further actions. This cycle continues as long as I have the sense of doership and Bhokta Bhava, which is the sense of enjoyership.\n\nI am the doer and I'm the enjoyer. And therefore we have analyzed in detail what is the nature of the action, what is the nature of the actor, and what is the nature of knowledge. So the prescription we have seen in the last verse we had been discussing says Sahajam Karma Kaunteya, do the actions which come naturally to you? Because after analyzing all these actions we get confused. Maybe the only Sattvic actions should be done.\n\nI should give up all the Rajasic and Tamasic actions. But that's not possible for any one of us, because what we don't have control over is our tendencies. The tendencies came from my past experiences. I do not have any control over my past. I have control over my present, and I don't have any control over my future.\n\nBut my present actions can determine what my future will be. I can control the present to shape my future. So therefore Bhagavan says after knowing all this, that the actions and actors can be Satvika, Raja, Sikh and Tamastik and their consequences, the results of those actions. So what am I supposed to do, Bhagavan? Bhagavan said, sahajam Karma Kaunteya.\n\nYou do the actions which come naturally to you at this time, because you have these accumulated vasanas and tendencies which you cannot get rid of overnight or just because you read Bhagavad Gita for half an hour in the morning. So Bhagavan said, do the actions which come naturally to you -- Sahajam Karma Kaunteya -- not the ones which I find to be the best actions to perform in this field or environment, but that which comes natural to me due to the tendencies of my mind and my intellect. Sadosham Api Na Tyajet. Now, I come to the conclusion that my desire is to do designs for buildings. But then the clients come to me.\n\nTheir projects may have some defects. I had clients who had tobacco companies. I have casinos as my client, and I even had a strip club as my client. In 2001, we were in our downtown Brook Binder building and there was a strip club on Brook Road. They called us up and said, \"Somebody recommended your name and we need your help doing some modifications to our club because there are some code violations.\" So my staff who fielded the phone came to me and said, \"Neil, this is a problem.\"\n\n\"I don't think you're going to allow it.\" I said, \"Of course I'm going to allow it. The client is a form of God.\" Gandhiji said, Grahaka Iti Bhagavan -- the customer is God's representative. I said, our job is to fix the code violations. Go and find out what the code violations are, figure out what needs to be done, give them the appropriate drawings, and make sure the code violations are mitigated. What he does is between him and his Bhagavan.\n\nWhat I do is between I and my Bhagavan. My Bhagavan says, your job as an architect to make sure if a client comes to you to get his building more in line with the local codes, you need to help him. Even actions with defects should not be given up. Because imagine if all architects say, \"Well, we are not helping any strip clubs anymore\" -- what happens? It will be a building full of fire violations, code violations, dangerous for the society. So Bhagawan said, even if your actions seem to have defects, because they come naturally to you, they should not be given up.\n\nSarva Arambahi Doshena Dhumena Agnihi Ava Vritaha -- all actions (arambha in this case means actions). Swamiji clarifies what is considered arambha: I'm doing it because I want to do it, to fulfill my desire. Any arambha will have its own defects. Any medication will have its own side effect. Any action prompted by your desire will have its own side effects.\n\nSo Bhagavan said that's given that the nature of any action. Therefore even if you find that something you are doing out of your nature and find a fault in it, you should not give up. Because every action if you analyze will have its own defects. Dhumena agnihi ava vritaha -- just as every fire will have smoke. Some fires may have more smoke, some may have very little. But there is smoke, because there is no combustion that we know of in our day-to-day life which is hundred percent combustion. Therefore there will be smoke.\n\nBut that does not mean that you give up lighting fire when you need it. Therefore you should continue to perform actions which comes naturally to you even though they may have defects. Now, if I work in this world in that manner, what should I expect? What happens is that when you are aligning your actions with your nature, the ego pressure will reduce. All the problems we see in our life come from egocentric actions. But when I do something which comes naturally to me, there will not be any ego pressure.\n\nAnd therefore you will gradually become asaktabuddhehe -- your intellect will become unattached. When you do something which comes naturally to you, there is very little ego involved in it. And therefore you don't get attached to that. Sarvatra -- your intellect becomes unattached in all actions that you perform which come naturally to you.\n\nBecause now your intellect is not attached, it's not creating more vasanas. Where we create more vasanas is when we get polluted by the experience in the field. For example, I go to the mall and all I want to do is buy one thing. But while I'm there, I get affected by the environment.\n\nI went with a list of 10 items and I came back with 18 items. That's how the environment affects us. If I'm consciously working in tune with my own nature, then I will be least affected by the environment. Therefore I will have the least creation of new vasanas, and the pressure of new vasanas will be at a minimum.\n\nSo I will be Jitatma -- I will have control over myself. Now anytime we say \"the self,\" we mean my mind, my intellect, and my senses. So Jitatma Vigataspruhaha -- one becomes without any desires. This may be very difficult for us to grasp.\n\nBut the more you function in line with your nature, the more you get success in that field. And you have less and less desire to do things which are not in line with your nature. So therefore you become Vigataspruhaha -- without any additional desires. I'm exhausting my past vasanas which created my tendencies, which put me into this field of activities. I'm exhausting my past vasanas by doing so.\n\nAnd therefore I'm getting least and least attached to my actions. And when I exhaust those vasanas, I'll have less and less desires. Because I'm only focused on the what I like. Niskarima siddhiyam paramam sanyasena adigachati. What was my final goal is to renounce actions. But right now, because of my past vasanas and the vasana pressures and my tendencies, I cannot renounce them.\n\nSo Bhagavan said, go ahead and act in this field which is in tune with your true nature. By doing so you will get less and less the sense of doership and sense of enjoyership. And therefore you will not take credit or blame for those actions. You will say, \"This is what I do, this is what I wanted to do, and I did it. What came out of it was not in my hand.\" More and more you give up that sense of doership.\n\nActions become non-actions because you're not taking any credit for them. If you act on behalf of your company and things go completely wrong -- but you did it exactly as per the company's policies and what your job description calls for -- would you be totally worried about that?\n\nThat's the company's problem. Why did they have this wrong policy? They asked me to do this. I, as a project manager or the VP, did it. Those happen to be the wrong policies. As long as you thought that you took the decision and were guiding the company's policy, then you are in trouble.\n\nBut you are working on behalf of the company. What you do is strictly the company's liability. Even though Bhagavan has given us all these capabilities, we take the responsibility and therefore we suffer for it. So Bhagavan said, when you reach a point where your actions become natural, you are not taking the credit or blame for them. You offer everything to him who has given you this talent.\n\nSo Bhagavan said, as long as you recognize that most of your ability to function in this world has come in spite of you, that sense will give you Naishkarmya Siddhi -- you will reach a state of actionlessness. And if you think about it, that's what we were trying to do in the first place! I was working towards my retirement, right? All this 401k and all that I'm putting together for my retirement -- an actionless state. Naishkarmya Siddhim Paramam -- he achieves the highest state of actionlessness. And therefore, Sanyasena Adhigacchati.\n\nAnd therefore he renounces all the sense of doership and enjoyership and achieves the highest state of complete bliss. The next verse says Siddhim Prapto Yatha Brahma Tata Apnoti Nibodhame Samase Naivakante Nishtha Gnanasya Yapara. We have come full circle. We have understood who we are, how we work in this world. And we also got the prescription of Bhagavan. So now Bhagavan said, okay, now that he understood all of that.\n\nNow if you follow this advice, then what will happen? Siddhim Prapto yatha Brahma Tatha Apnoti Nibodhame ultimate goal was to reach the state of infiniteness. One with the Supreme Self. Why do I want to be one with the supreme self? Because the limited self is not giving me joy and happiness. Therefore I want to transcend it.\n\nIt's not that I'm doing a favor to the Supreme. I'm joining his party. This state is not giving me joy and happiness which I'm looking for. So I want to achieve a state which can give me joy and happiness. And at that state, by all accounts we have seen is the only one state, the state of the Supreme Being. So everyone is knowingly or unknowingly trying to achieve that.\n\nWe are failing and then going in circles. The Bhagavan says, let me tell you, it's a very simple and clear path. Act according to your nature. Do not do anything which is contrary to your nature. Because that will complicate your life, will create more unnecessary vasanas, unnecessary desires and then unnecessary actions.",
      "reflection": "Verse 49 describes the ultimate state: asakta-buddhi (unattached intellect), jitatma (conquered self), vigata-spriha (free from longing) - such a person attains through sannyasa the supreme perfection of naishkarmya-siddhi, the state of actionlessness. This does not mean inactivity but rather action that leaves no karmic residue. When actions flow naturally from one's dharma without ego-driven attachment, they become like a hobby - full of engagement but without the burden of \"I am doing this for that result.\"\n\nVerses 50-51 begin describing the path to Brahman. The process starts with buddhya vishuddhaya yukto - endowed with purified intellect, controlling the self with dhriti (steadfastness), abandoning sense objects, and casting aside raga-dvesha (attachment and aversion). This is the practical instruction: purify the intellect, establish control, renounce sensory preoccupation, and release the grip of likes and dislikes.\n\nToday, examine your attachments and aversions: What are you currently pursuing (raga)? What are you currently avoiding (dvesha)? These twin forces keep us bound to the wheel of karma. The instruction is not to become indifferent but to vyudasya - cast aside the compulsive quality of attachment and aversion. You can still have preferences without being driven by them. Practice with one attachment today: notice it, acknowledge it, but do not act from its compulsion. Notice one aversion: face it rather than automatically avoiding it. This is the beginning of jitatma - conquering the self."

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 18, Moksa Sannyasa Yoga, Yoga of Liberation through Renunciation. So far we have seen that we are the product of our past and therefore we have tendencies, likings, and dislikings. All the discussion so far was about Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas -- this is Sattvik, this is Rajasik, and so on. So the natural tendency is to think, \"Well, I'll pick the best which I can find. This looks like Sattva, so I'll just do Sattvik things only.\"\n\nBut our tendencies and our desires and the coloring of our mind won't let us do that. So the advice from Bhagavan is Sahajam Karma kontea sadoshena PI Natya Jat. Do the actions which come naturally to you -- those which are in line with your own personality, your tendencies, your likings, your dislikings. Do those actions even though you find them to have defects. Because I have learned 17 chapters of Bhagavad Gita now, and suddenly I find that most of my actions are Rajasik.\n\nThat's your nature right now that comes naturally to you. That's where the Bhagavad Gita started. Bhagavan said to Arjuna, you are a warrior. The Rajasic action is your nature in the Kshatriya. You can't give it up right now, run towards jungle to meditate, because that will be against your tendencies in nature. That will actually create more harm to your path of evolution than help you.\n\nIt won't purify your mind, pollute your mind and confuse your mind. So Sahajam Karma kaun teja sadoshana pen Natya Jat. Do not give up the actions which come naturally to you. Even though you find some defects, they are not perfect. And then Bhagavan said that by doing so you will purify yourself and consolation given to Sarvarambahi kadushena dumena agnihi ava vritaha all actions, no matter how pure you see them have some defects. There is always a side effect to even the best medicine you can take.\n\nThe Bhagavan said Any actions which you have to perform in accordance with your nature even if you find the faults in it, continue. Because every action will have its own defects. But then what do I do with it? The only thing you can do is perfect your attitude towards your actions. Actions by nature has their own pluses and minuses but you can change your attitude towards your actions. So the next few verses which we have seen say Asakta Buddhi -- the first thing you do is detach your intellect from your actions.\n\nAsaktabuddhi Sarvatra Jitatma Vigataspruhaha -- I'm doing these things because they come naturally to me. As I said, Gita class is a Kamya Karma for me, because I like to do it, it is my desire to do it. So if it comes naturally to you, do it. But Bhagavan said, Asaktabuddhehe -- detach your mind and intellect from those actions.\n\nSarvatra Jitatma -- have self-control over your desires, your likings, and dislikes. I'm doing it, but I may not have any control of the outcome. I may not be allowed to do these things; the environment, the situation may not allow me. I need to be content with that, without attachment. I want to do it, but if there is no opportunity to do it, I'll continue with what is available to me.\n\nThe goal here is to achieve a state of Naishkarmya Siddhi -- whatever I do, I do not feel that I'm doing it. As I said, when we are working on our hobbies, it's not work. I'm putting in lots of effort, but I don't consider it work because that's my hobby. The other day Krishna told me, \"I'm going to call you. We're going to practice together.\"\n\nBecause when we are not practicing, it's not really working. \"When are you going to call me?\" \"Well, Saturday I'm not available,\" because that becomes work for me. Naishkarmya Siddhi is like this: when everything I do becomes my hobby, I become actionless. It's all basically in line with my nature.\n\nParamam Sanyasena Adhigacchati -- such a person achieves the highest level of renunciation. By doing the things which you are supposed to do, you can achieve sannyasa. The definition of sannyasa is giving up the sense of agency. Not giving up things and beings, but giving up the sense of agency -- \"I am doing it\" and \"I am enjoying it.\" When you give that up, you are a sannyasi.\n\nBhagavan said, if you do all the things in line with your nature, you will never have that sense of agency, nor will you even notice that you are enjoying it. You get so engrossed in the stuff which you do for your hobby that neither you are aware that you are putting lots of efforts into it, nor whether it's painful or enjoyable. Music practice was the most painful thing I had when I was going to my teacher's classes for that little time. But it was still what I wanted to do. So whether it was a pain or a joy, I never noticed it. This is something I want to do.\n\nThat Bhagavan says -- in that state you are neither aware that you are the doer nor aware that you are the enjoyer. When you achieve that state, you have achieved sannyasa. With that the next verse says Siddhim prapto yatha brahma tatha apnoti nibodame sama se nay kaunteya nista gnana seya yapara. Now I'll tell you in brief how to reach Brahman, having achieved that siddhi -- the Naishkarmya Siddhi.\n\nNow everything comes naturally to me. I do everything naturally. I don't have any anxiety about whether I'm enjoying or suffering through it, or whether good will come out of it. I just enjoy doing it. Therefore I'm doing it. He said, achieving that siddhi in your actions and achieving sannyasa through that -- how you can then achieve Brahman, I will tell you now.\n\nSo now comes the prescription or the detailed guidance of how to achieve that. The verse we have seen after that is Buddaya visuddaya Yuktah dhruti atmanam niyam yucha. First thing is Buddaya Vishuddaya -- you have to purify your intellect. My intellect is right now polluted by my ego.\n\nMy ego says I am always right, even though everybody else says otherwise. My intellect says I am the smartest among all. So Buddhaya Vishuddaya -- the purified intellect will see things as they are. The intellect is purified by not having ego polluting it. Dhruti Atmanam -- be firm in your own self. This is what I want to do. This is what I like to do.\n\nAnd this is where I am putting my efforts. Dhruti Atmanam firm in your own self. What is my true nature? I know what I really like. I was just listening to NPR yesterday and some guy who was a lawyer and has a nice corporate practice, he gives up and becomes a LEGO artist. I don't know whether anybody heard that.\n\nIn other words, he makes complex form of lions and stuff. He's basically an artist whose work is now displayed all these places. But he gave up the job and became a LEGO artist. And LEGO company provides him free logos. When they have a new LEGO comes out in thousands and he creates whatever. He said that the worst day as an artist is better than the best day as a lawyer.\n\nFor me, therefore I did it. He found what he likes. He followed Bhagavad Gita without reading it. I want to do this no matter what the outcome may be. But this is what I like. Buddaya Visuddhaya Having purified my intellect, what is my true nature?\n\nOur intellect typically gets polluted by worrying about what others will think of us. And therefore we make choices accordingly. We choose our profession -- at least in my time it was very simple. You didn't have to figure out what you like. If you don't get admission in medicine, go to chemical engineering. Chemical engineering doesn't work out? Go to mechanical engineering. Mechanical doesn't work out? Electrical. Then civil. And if you are completely out of all that, go to architecture. You didn't have to figure out what you like.\n\nYou just figured out what the social scale was. Bhagavan said that's a perfect recipe for disaster for you. Dhruti Atmanam Niyamyacha Sabdayati Visayam Tektva Ragadveso, vidashyacha sabdadi sound, etc. In other words, all the sense objects from outside which is polluting your mind and intellect. You are not getting disturbed by this. I wish I can become an artist but there is no money in it.\n\nDoctors make more money, so let me go to medicine even though I hate that profession. There was one guy on Kaun Banega Karorpati. He had just done his internship, and Amitabh Bachchan asked him, \"So after that, what next?\" He said, \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Don't you want to do MD or MS or something?\" He said, \"Yeah, I can do MD or MS, but I'm not interested in it.\" \"Why are you not interested in furthering your career?\" He said, \"I don't like medicine. My parents wanted me to go to medicine. That's why I went to medicine.\"\n\nBut I want to be an IAS officer. I've seen IAS officers. I've seen what they do and their power and their influence. And that's what I want to be. So I did what my parents wanted me to do. Now I'm going to do what I want to do.\n\nAnd how do I achieve this purified intellect and self-control? Vivikta Sevi, Laghvashi -- now comes the discipline or guidance for how you can find out what you really like. How do you find out what your true nature is? How do I align my actions with my own nature? Vivikta Sevi -- solitude. Solitude is something we think about.\n\nWe are all afraid of loneliness. I'll tell you -- when we were young, if on Saturday you had no invitation to go to any party, we didn't know what to do. \"Neil, what are you doing over the weekend?\" \"So Neil, how was your weekend?\"\n\nI said, \"It's always the same. My weekends are always the same.\" \"Which party did you go to?\" If you don't get invited to a party, you don't know what to do with your life. That weekend you're completely lost. Learn to be happy with yourself.\n\nFind a way that you can enjoy solitude. That you think, thank God nobody is now here. I can be by myself and enjoy my time. I'm sure most of your parents went through that. But solitude is a practice to figure out how you can enjoy yourself by yourself. Laghvashi -- eating but little. Other texts say: eat as much as you would take your medicine.\n\nYour medication -- you never take more than what your doctor says you should take. One tablet means one tablet. That's what the doctor said, right? Not, \"Well, the doctor says one, but I'm a little more aggressive about it, so I'm going to take three at a time.\" Take only what you need. Your food should be just like that -- only what you need. The texts elaborately describe that a quarter of your belly should be filled with food, a quarter left for water, and half left for air.\n\nThat much you should eat -- Laghvashi -- because you know that when you're overstuffed, you're uncomfortable and the mind is not available for anything else. Laghvashi Yata-Vak-Kaya-Manasaha -- control over your speech, body, and mind. Swamiji explains here that vak (speech) includes all organs of action. It's an indicator: all the organs of action should be in control.\n\nIt does not say stop them -- just keep them in control through moderation. Kaya -- body. The body is the gross form of my mind.",
      "reflection": "These verses provide the complete prescription for Self-realization. Verse 52 lists the practices: vivikta-sevi (cultivating solitude), laghvashi (eating lightly), yata-vak-kaya-manasa (controlling speech, body, and mind), dhyana-yoga-para (devoted to meditation), and vairagyam samupashrita (established in dispassion). These are not random austerities but a coherent program for purifying the instrument through which we perceive reality. Notice the emphasis on moderation - laghu (light) eating, yata (controlled) faculties - not extreme suppression.\n\nVerse 53 lists what must be abandoned: ahamkara (ego), bala (force/power), darpa (arrogance), kama (desire), krodha (anger), and parigraha (possessiveness). Casting these off, one becomes nirmama (without \"mine-ness\") and shanta (peaceful), qualifying for Brahma-bhuyaya - becoming one with Brahman. Verse 54 describes the result: Brahma-bhuta (established in Brahman), prasannatma (serene-minded), neither grieving nor craving, equal toward all beings, and attaining supreme devotion.\n\nThe path is clear but challenging. Today, practice vivikta-seva - cultivating moments of solitude, even briefly. Examine your laghu-ashi - are you eating more than needed? Practice yata-vak - restraint in speech before responding. These small adjustments accumulate. Also examine: where does ahamkara (ego) drive your actions? Where does parigraha (possessiveness) create suffering? Identify one instance of each today and consciously release it. The promise is profound: through consistent practice, one attains prasannatma - a naturally serene mind that neither grieves loss nor craves gain."

      "commentary": "Okay, we had been discussing chapter 18, Moksha Sannyasi, yoga, Yoga of Liberation through Renunciation. And we are literally coming to the end of Bhagavan's advice in this chapter. So in the beginning, obviously, we have seen that the goal of life is to achieve permanent happiness. And we have heard from our scriptures that the only way one can achieve that perfect happiness is either one becomes a sannyasi or a yogi. Everyone else is in the rut of life. And therefore, if that's your goal, to achieve that permanent happiness, you have to either become a sannyasi or a yogi.\n\nSo the chapter opened with the definition of sannyasi and yogi. The one who has renounced the sense of \"I am the doer\" -- the sense of agency -- is the sannyasi. And who is the yogi? The one who has given up the desire for the fruits of actions is a yogi. So to achieve that permanent happiness, I have to either become a sannyasi or a yogi. And then the prescription came.\n\nIt is easier for us to give up the fruits of actions than giving up the sense of agency. Ego is so entrenched in my personality right now that for me to think I'm not doing it is more difficult. I must at least give up the expectations for desired results of my actions. I can start with that. If I have to do that, I first have to understand what is action and how it is done, what is my involvement in performing my actions. So we have this detailed analysis of what is action, what is an actor, and what propels that action.\n\nThe knowledge propels my actions. My knowledge about myself and this world, my relationship with this world drives me to act in this world. So we have detailed analysis of these three, the action, the actor, and the knowledge. We have seen that all of these three are driven by the texture of my mind. My mind has either a sattvic, Rajasic or tamasic tendencies that will make me either a sattvic actor, Rajasic actor, tamasic actor, that will drive me to the sattvic actions, rajasic actions or tamasic actions. So the texture of my mind is the basis for my life.\n\nWho I am today is a reflection of my mind. With self-introspection, I may come to a conclusion about the makeup of my mind. Right now I'm 20% Sattvic, 60% Rajasic, and 20% Tamasic. I really don't have a choice to change that overnight. Just because I go to a doctor to get my blood work done which I do every four months and they say your cholesterol is too high, triglycerides are way out of control.\n\nJust knowing that, I will not be able to change it right away. Neither is there any magic bullet where I can change it overnight. But I can start on a course of action -- a course of action which my doctors constantly, every four months, remind me of. I remember the first month, but for three months I take it easy. And as soon as the fourth month comes, I'm vigilant again. I have to be in that prescribed method consistently.\n\nSo the first thing is I have to accept my condition. I have to accept that I have the high cholesterol and high triglycerides and I have this propensity to get a heart attack and all that. If I deny that, if I'm in denial -- for a long time I denied my blood pressure. I go to my one doctor, my blood pressure always comes out right. I go anywhere else, my blood pressure is very high. So I go to the insurance company, they check and say, \"Your blood pressure is high.\"\n\nI said, \"No, no, you are wrong. Let me go back to my doctor, I'll check it out.\" For some reason it worked -- every time I go there, my blood pressure is normal. I go anywhere else, my blood pressure is not normal. So I was in complete denial that I have high blood pressure.\n\nFinally I had to accept that I probably do have high blood pressure. So the first step is acceptance -- accepting that I may have this condition. The conditioning which I see as myself is not in my control. It was in my control at one point of time, but it has now become the past. So I have now become who I am because of all my past experiences and actions. And I accept that now I have to work on it.\n\nSo first thing I have to do is what comes naturally to me at this time and then take it from there what my goal would be. So Bhagavan said, now if your goal is to achieve permanent happiness, you have come to this conclusion: this is the makeup of your mind. The advice is Sahajam Karma Kaunteya Sadosham Api Na Tyajet. Do the actions which come naturally to you, even though they are imperfect. My chosen field of action may not be the most popular, the most appreciated.\n\nBut that's what my nature is. I like carpentry and I want to be a carpenter. I like arts and I want to be an artist. They always have this hungry artists exhibitions because artists go hungry. But that's the chosen field comes naturally to me. The Bhagavan said, sahajam karma kaunteya sadosha bin natya jat.\n\nYou cannot give up the field of actions which come naturally to you. First advice, Clear guidance. Stay in the field which comes naturally to you and then go from there. So the next advice is then. Okay, Now I have figured out what my natural field of action is. But how should I act so that I'll get the benefit of that?\n\nThe next thing is Asaktah Jitatma -- without attachment and without any expectation. We have seen there are only two paths: either to become a sannyasi or a yogi. Yogi is the one who gives up Karma Phala, the desire for fruits of action. So I've found the field of my actions.\n\nI'm ready to now launch my career in that field or my endeavors -- but without any expectation. I will do what I like to the best I can. What comes out of my actions is not in my control, because I am not the Karma Faladatta. Karma Faladatta is always the Lord, Ishvara, somebody other than me.\n\nI need to leave it to them their duties to perform diligently. I will perform my duty diligently. The Bhagavan said, perform your actions without attachment expectations in the field which comes naturally to you. Doing so, you will develop devotion for me. You will align your thoughts with the one who empowers you to do these actions. So therefore he said, become one with me.\n\nOffer everything to me. And the last few verses which you have seen. He says, bhaktiya mam abhijanati yavat na aschasmi tatvatah tatomam tattvato gnatva visatei tad anantharam. Just by acting in this manner of offering everything to him. As we have seen in detail the previous verses, once I decided the field of my actions, I decided that I am not really the one who empowers me to act. The consciousness functioning through me as my life empowers me to act.\n\nI'll be only able to conduct Gita classes as long as I'm alive. The day I drop dead, Gita classes will be history. That's because my consciousness in me allows me to understand Bhagavad Gita. So the empowering authority is something other than me. That which connects the electricity in this room is the empowering authority for the electricity. We have lights, we have air conditioning.\n\nRight now we are pretty happy. Things are working fine. But when they first rented the place, the electricity wasn't there. He thought, \"I am the Almighty for this place.\" Calls me up and says, \"Not working.\"\n\nI said, I think the machine is not working. Electricity is not connecting through Dominion Virginia Power. Dominion Virginia Power is the final authority that the electricity comes here. I have a limited power to turn the switch on and off when I need that. But in that limited power, I start thinking because it is always there. I think I am in control and I can turn this thing on and off.\n\nIt is only when the power goes out I realize I am just a Nimitta Matra. Virginia Power decides whether I have electricity or not. As long as that electricity is functioning through this space, I can control this space. When Dominion Virginia Power connection is disconnected, no matter how many times I turn the switch on and off, nothing happens. Bhagavan said, you need to recognize this fact that you are connected to me as the supreme consciousness which is functioning through you. If you keep that in mind all the time, they will make sure that that connection never gets disconnected.\n\nSee, when I design buildings, most buildings have normal electricity connection. And then when there is power outage, the connection goes out. But I designed the emergency shelter. Actually medical examiner's office in downtown. Well, you can't have the power go out during emergency. That is the time when there's a disaster.\n\nThat's the time that office becomes most active. They may have all these disaster victims coming to this place. Those pathologists have to work overnight to deal with them. So you need to have a dual power system for that. We connected that building from two different grids. So even though one grid is out, the other grid is connected.\n\nThey will never be out of that electrical connection. That's where you will have this permanent connection. Bhagavan said, if you want eternal happiness, you need to make sure that your connection to me is always connected. And for that, you have to offer everything that you do to me. Remembering constantly that I can only do this because he's functioning through me. With that attitude, you will develop devotion for him.\n\nYou will be constantly attached to him. So we both have to have that dual connection. Bhagavan has to have connection with me and I have to have connection with him. That connection when developed, we call it devotion. It's one that devotion takes place. Bhakti mam Avijanati Yavatna Asha asmi Tattvatahara Tatotam tattvoto Gnatva visate tat Anantaram.\n\nBy devotion he knows me in essence. Once I become identified completely with someone or something, I know that thing or being in its essence or his essence. He forthwith enters into me the supreme. Once I completely identify myself with the supreme self, I enters into him. In other words, I become one with that supreme being. Sarvakarmani API sada Kurvanaha mat vyapaasrayah mat prasadat avapnothi Saswatam padam avyayam.\n\nThe process took place. I gave up identification with my ego. I chose the field of my actions. I started working in the field of my actions without any expectations and offered all my actions to him. Now with that connection I have identified completely with him. So now my life is doing all actions always taking refuge in him with his grace.\n\nNow I have not become happy with my efforts. I have become peaceful and happy with his grace. This space is properly conditioned and lit up right now -- by the grace of Dominion Virginia Power. When their grace is taken away from me, the lights will go away and the air conditioning will go away. As long as I recognize that the lights and air conditioning are not because of me -- not because I'm paying the bills, but because of their grace in connecting electricity to this space -- then I will be fine.\n\nThen I'll develop that devotion to Dominion Virginia Power. As soon as the bill comes, pay the bill. Bhagavan said, one who becomes one with me, with this root of actions he has become one with me and therefore he achieves that Saswatam Padam avyayam.",
      "reflection": "These verses describe the culmination of the spiritual journey through devotion. Verse 55 declares: bhaktya mam abhijanati - through devotion one knows Me in essence, and knowing Me thus in truth, immediately enters into Me. This is not intellectual knowing but direct realization through love. The analogy of complete identification applies - just as we intimately know those we deeply love, complete devotion to the Divine yields complete knowledge of the Divine.\n\nVerse 56 offers remarkable assurance: sarva-karmani api sada kurvano - even while always performing all actions, one who takes refuge in Me attains by My grace the eternal, imperishable abode. This is the Gita's liberating promise: you do not need to abandon action for liberation. Continue your duties, but mat-vyapashraya - take refuge in the Divine. Mat-prasadat - by grace, not solely personal effort, comes the eternal state. Verse 57 summarizes: mentally surrender all actions to Me, keep Me as your supreme goal, practice buddhi-yoga, and constantly fix your mind on Me.\n\nThe practical instruction is clear: maintain your connection to the Source through all activities. Like staying connected to the power grid while using electricity for various purposes, stay connected to the Divine while engaging with the world. Today, practice mat-chitta - keeping the Divine in your awareness through activities. Before each task, briefly remember the Source of your abilities. During activities, occasionally pause and reconnect. This is not adding a spiritual practice to your day but infusing your entire day with spiritual awareness. The promise is that this constant remembrance, combined with offering all actions, leads to the eternal abode - by grace."

      "commentary": "Okay, we had been discussing chapter 18, Moksha Sannyasi, yoga, Yoga of Liberation through Renunciation. And we are literally coming to the end of Bhagavan's advice in this chapter. So in the beginning, obviously, we have seen that the goal of life is to achieve permanent happiness. And we have heard from our scriptures that the only way one can achieve that perfect happiness is either one becomes a sannyasi or a yogi. Everyone else is in the rut of life. And therefore, if that's your goal, to achieve that permanent happiness, you have to either become a sannyasi or a yogi.\n\nSo the chapter opened with the definition of sannyasi and yogi. The one who has renounced the sense of \"I am the doer\" -- the sense of agency -- is the sannyasi. And who is the yogi? The one who has given up the desire for the fruits of actions is a yogi. So to achieve that permanent happiness, I have to either become a sannyasi or a yogi. And then the prescription came.\n\nIt is easier for us to give up the fruits of actions than giving up the sense of agency. Ego is so entrenched in my personality right now that for me to think I'm not doing it is more difficult. I must at least give up the expectations for desired results of my actions. I can start with that. If I have to do that, I first have to understand what is action and how it is done, what is my involvement in performing my actions. So we have this detailed analysis of what is action, what is an actor, and what propels that action.\n\nThe knowledge propels my actions. My knowledge about myself and this world, my relationship with this world drives me to act in this world. So we have detailed analysis of these three, the action, the actor, and the knowledge. We have seen that all of these three are driven by the texture of my mind. My mind has either a sattvic, Rajasic or tamasic tendencies that will make me either a sattvic actor, Rajasic actor, tamasic actor, that will drive me to the sattvic actions, rajasic actions or tamasic actions. So the texture of my mind is the basis for my life.\n\nWho I am today is a reflection of my mind. With self-introspection, I may come to a conclusion about the makeup of my mind. Right now I'm 20% Sattvic, 60% Rajasic, and 20% Tamasic. I really don't have a choice to change that overnight. Just because I go to a doctor to get my blood work done which I do every four months and they say your cholesterol is too high, triglycerides are way out of control.\n\nJust knowing that, I will not be able to change it right away. Neither is there any magic bullet where I can change it overnight. But I can start on a course of action -- a course of action which my doctors constantly, every four months, remind me of. I remember the first month, but for three months I take it easy. And as soon as the fourth month comes, I'm vigilant again. I have to be in that prescribed method consistently.\n\nSo the first thing is I have to accept my condition. I have to accept that I have the high cholesterol and high triglycerides and I have this propensity to get a heart attack and all that. If I deny that, if I'm in denial -- for a long time I denied my blood pressure. I go to my one doctor, my blood pressure always comes out right. I go anywhere else, my blood pressure is very high. So I go to the insurance company, they check and say, \"Your blood pressure is high.\"\n\nI said, \"No, no, you are wrong. Let me go back to my doctor, I'll check it out.\" For some reason it worked -- every time I go there, my blood pressure is normal. I go anywhere else, my blood pressure is not normal. So I was in complete denial that I have high blood pressure.\n\nFinally I had to accept that I probably do have high blood pressure. So the first step is acceptance -- accepting that I may have this condition. The conditioning which I see as myself is not in my control. It was in my control at one point of time, but it has now become the past. So I have now become who I am because of all my past experiences and actions. And I accept that now I have to work on it.\n\nSo first thing I have to do is what comes naturally to me at this time and then take it from there what my goal would be. So Bhagavan said, now if your goal is to achieve permanent happiness, you have come to this conclusion: this is the makeup of your mind. The advice is Sahajam Karma Kaunteya Sadosham Api Na Tyajet. Do the actions which come naturally to you, even though they are imperfect. My chosen field of action may not be the most popular, the most appreciated.\n\nBut that's what my nature is. I like carpentry and I want to be a carpenter. I like arts and I want to be an artist. They always have this hungry artists exhibitions because artists go hungry. But that's the chosen field comes naturally to me. The Bhagavan said, sahajam karma kaunteya sadosha bin natya jat.\n\nYou cannot give up the field of actions which come naturally to you. First advice, Clear guidance. Stay in the field which comes naturally to you and then go from there. So the next advice is then. Okay, Now I have figured out what my natural field of action is. But how should I act so that I'll get the benefit of that?\n\nThe next thing is Asaktah Jitatma -- without attachment and without any expectation. We have seen there are only two paths: either to become a sannyasi or a yogi. Yogi is the one who gives up Karma Phala, the desire for fruits of action. So I've found the field of my actions.\n\nI'm ready to now launch my career in that field or my endeavors -- but without any expectation. I will do what I like to the best I can. What comes out of my actions is not in my control, because I am not the Karma Faladatta. Karma Faladatta is always the Lord, Ishvara, somebody other than me.\n\nI need to leave it to them their duties to perform diligently. I will perform my duty diligently. The Bhagavan said, perform your actions without attachment expectations in the field which comes naturally to you. Doing so, you will develop devotion for me. You will align your thoughts with the one who empowers you to do these actions. So therefore he said, become one with me.\n\nOffer everything to me. And the last few verses which you have seen. He says, bhaktiya mam abhijanati yavat na aschasmi tatvatah tatomam tattvato gnatva visatei tad anantharam. Just by acting in this manner of offering everything to him. As we have seen in detail the previous verses, once I decided the field of my actions, I decided that I am not really the one who empowers me to act. The consciousness functioning through me as my life empowers me to act.\n\nI'll be only able to conduct Gita classes as long as I'm alive. The day I drop dead, Gita classes will be history. That's because my consciousness in me allows me to understand Bhagavad Gita. So the empowering authority is something other than me. That which connects the electricity in this room is the empowering authority for the electricity. We have lights, we have air conditioning.\n\nRight now we are pretty happy. Things are working fine. But when they first rented the place, the electricity wasn't there. He thought, \"I am the Almighty for this place.\" Calls me up and says, \"Not working.\"\n\nI said, I think the machine is not working. Electricity is not connecting through Dominion Virginia Power. Dominion Virginia Power is the final authority that the electricity comes here. I have a limited power to turn the switch on and off when I need that. But in that limited power, I start thinking because it is always there. I think I am in control and I can turn this thing on and off.\n\nIt is only when the power goes out I realize I am just a Nimitta Matra. Virginia Power decides whether I have electricity or not. As long as that electricity is functioning through this space, I can control this space. When Dominion Virginia Power connection is disconnected, no matter how many times I turn the switch on and off, nothing happens. Bhagavan said, you need to recognize this fact that you are connected to me as the supreme consciousness which is functioning through you. If you keep that in mind all the time, they will make sure that that connection never gets disconnected.\n\nSee, when I design buildings, most buildings have normal electricity connection. And then when there is power outage, the connection goes out. But I designed the emergency shelter. Actually medical examiner's office in downtown. Well, you can't have the power go out during emergency. That is the time when there's a disaster.\n\nThat's the time that office becomes most active. They may have all these disaster victims coming to this place. Those pathologists have to work overnight to deal with them. So you need to have a dual power system for that. We connected that building from two different grids. So even though one grid is out, the other grid is connected.\n\nThey will never be out of that electrical connection. That's where you will have this permanent connection. Bhagavan said, if you want eternal happiness, you need to make sure that your connection to me is always connected. And for that, you have to offer everything that you do to me. Remembering constantly that I can only do this because he's functioning through me. With that attitude, you will develop devotion for him.\n\nYou will be constantly attached to him. So we both have to have that dual connection. Bhagavan has to have connection with me and I have to have connection with him. That connection when developed, we call it devotion. It's one that devotion takes place. Bhakti mam Avijanati Yavatna Asha asmi Tattvatahara Tatotam tattvoto Gnatva visate tat Anantaram.\n\nBy devotion he knows me in essence. Once I become identified completely with someone or something, I know that thing or being in its essence or his essence. He forthwith enters into me the supreme. Once I completely identify myself with the supreme self, I enters into him. In other words, I become one with that supreme being. Sarvakarmani API sada Kurvanaha mat vyapaasrayah mat prasadat avapnothi Saswatam padam avyayam.\n\nThe process took place. I gave up identification with my ego. I chose the field of my actions. I started working in the field of my actions without any expectations and offered all my actions to him. Now with that connection I have identified completely with him. So now my life is doing all actions always taking refuge in him with his grace.\n\nNow I have not become happy with my efforts. I have become peaceful and happy with his grace. This space is properly conditioned and lit up right now -- by the grace of Dominion Virginia Power. When their grace is taken away from me, the lights will go away and the air conditioning will go away. As long as I recognize that the lights and air conditioning are not because of me -- not because I'm paying the bills, but because of their grace in connecting electricity to this space -- then I will be fine.\n\nThen I'll develop that devotion to Dominion Virginia Power. As soon as the bill comes, pay the bill. Bhagavan said, one who becomes one with me, with this root of actions he has become one with me and therefore he achieves that Saswatam Padam avyayam.",
      "reflection": "These verses present both the promise and the warning. Verse 58: mat-chitta - with mind fixed on Me, you will overcome all obstacles by My grace. But aham-karat na shroshyasi - if through ego you will not listen, you will perish. The choice is stark: surrender and be carried across all difficulties, or cling to ego and be destroyed. Verse 59 addresses Arjuna's specific situation: if through ego you think \"I will not fight,\" your resolution is vain - Prakriti will compel you. This applies universally: we cannot escape our nature through willful avoidance.\n\nVerse 60 drives the point home: svabhava-jena nibaddha - bound by your own karma born of your nature, what you do not wish to do through delusion, you will do helplessly. This is not fatalism but psychological truth. Our vasanas (tendencies) are powerful forces that will express themselves. The question is not whether to act but whether to act consciously or be driven unconsciously. Arjuna cannot avoid being a warrior; his nature will assert itself. Better to fight consciously with understanding than to fight unconsciously driven by repressed instincts.\n\nExamine where ego-resistance is preventing you from doing what needs to be done. What are you avoiding through willful stubbornness that your nature will eventually force you to face? The teaching suggests that surrender is not weakness but wisdom - recognizing that fighting against our fundamental nature is futile. Today, identify one area where you are resisting something that aligns with your dharma. Ask: Is my resistance protecting something valuable, or is it merely ego avoiding what feels threatening? Often what we resist most persistently is exactly what we need to embrace."

      "commentary": "Discussing chapter 18, Moksha Sannyasa Yoga -- Yoga of Liberation through Renunciation. We are at the conclusion of Bhagavad Gita, and in this chapter Bhagawan has stated a few simple facts which we already know. We have discussed them before and also experienced them in our life. Something as simple as this: in this world, people have different temperaments. Not all people are alike. Each one has his or her own temperament. Depending on that temperament, he may be good at one thing or another. Everybody is not good at everything, but depending on your temperament, you may be good at something.\n\nAnd also this temperament will make you like some things and dislike other things. So this temperament is your own nature or your personality. Therefore, because in this world the different people have different personalities, different temperaments, they do different things. Some are good at scholarly pursuits and some are good at doing heroic things and some are good at creating wealth and some are just happy serving others, you may find yourself to be somewhere in this spectrum. Not everybody likes same type of coffee. Some like strong, some like very mild.\n\nOthers may be somewhere in between. So you will find yourself somewhere in the spectrum of temperament. Some are very sattvic, some are very tamasic and most of us are somewhere in between. Therefore find out what your real nature is. Bhagawan said this is a fact that each one has his or her own qualities and temperaments. So depending on your temperament, now you have to find the field of activity which is appropriate for you.\n\nSo earlier in chapter three, Bhagavan said Swadharma Nidhanam Shreya Paradharma Bhayavahah -- working in your own nature is better, because another's dharma is frightening. If you try to do something against your nature, it will be very frightening. You will always be a fish out of water. You are a very artistic person and you want to run a business -- you will be a fish out of water.\n\nYou will not feel comfortable. So therefore find your own Dharma and then work in it. So in this chapter again he reminds us what is good for you. So he said that Sriyan Swadharmo Vigunaha, Paradharma, Swanushti daat. Your Dharma alone is good for you, even though it has faults. It may not be as pristine as others, but this is what your nature is and it is good for you.\n\nAnd therefore Sahajam, Karma, kaunteh. So find the field of activities which come naturally to you. Do the activities which come naturally to you. You shall not incur any sin in doing so. You shall not incur any sin. Continue doing what you like, what comes naturally to you.\n\nAnd do not worry about whether I'll incur any sin or I'll incur any wrong tendencies. We have learnt in the previous chapter that no matter what your tendencies are and what activities you are performing, you start with Om Tatsat, purify them. So in chapter 17 we have learned that no matter what your Saddha is, whether it is Sattvic, whether it is, whether it is Raja Sikh, whether it is Tamasic, you are acting in that manner. But rather than worrying about whether it is Sattvik, Rajasik, or Tamasik, do whatever is natural to you. But whatever you do, start with Aum. Every activity which you do, remember him, that he is almighty and all pervading.\n\nAnd he is enabling me to do this activity. So start with Om and say end with Tat, that this is not for me, this is for you. There is nothing that I am doing it for myself because I am not even capable of doing anything. He is all pervading and everything I am doing, I am offering to him because he made me do this. So Bhagawan said, with that attitude, when you perform any actions in the field of your liking which come naturally to you, you will find your happiness. We try everything and we get frustrated.\n\nThat's because we say, one, you are not pursuing your own Dharma and secondly, you think you are doing it for yourself. Those two things, if you correct them -- find the field of activities which is natural to you, and then don't expect anything from it -- Then Bhagavan said that you will be relieved from these sorrows and unhappiness. In spite of all this diversity which we see in this world, there is a profound unity. Iswarahas, Sarvabhutanam, Prudeshe, Arjuna, Tisthati.\n\nHe said, this is why you should offer everything to him and remember him all the time. Even though you find yourself to be very different from others, even though you find all these people are very different from each other, there's one thing very common. They are all functioning because of that one single principle functioning through them. There are not several consciousnesses -- mine different from yours, yours different from hers, hers different from his. One consciousness functioning through all. Depending on the quality of the equipment, outer behavior will be different from each other.\n\nJust as we have used these examples many many times. This room space is dependent on the conditioning. How far the walls are from each other and how far the ceiling is from the floor. But the space is the same space as it is outside. The space outside and space inside is no different same. All pervading space is in each room in this universe.\n\nWherever you find a space which is confined by limitations, the space is universal. The same way, Isvara Sarva Bhutanam Hrudeshe Tishtati -- the core of all being is the Ishvara himself residing there. Because of his presence only, things are functioning. But how are they functioning? Bhramayan Sarva Bhutani Yantra Rudhani Mayaya -- by his illusive power Maya, everyone is functioning in this world.\n\nThey are functioning because of Iswara's presence and his power of Maya. The elusive power Brahmayan Sarvabhoot are Yantra Rudhani. It seems like they are just mounted on a machine, helpless to act in this world. We are driven by our own likes and dislikes and vasanas almost compulsively. Whether we like it or not. We see something which is of our liking, we will be attracted towards it.\n\nSomething which is of not conducive, we will be staying away from it. Bhagavan said everybody is propelled by this Maya as if they are helpless. But at the core of all being, Ishvara is the cause for all beings functioning in this world. Keep that unity in mind. So this is a profound revelation. We knew that everybody is different from each other.\n\nEveryone has their own qualities. Everyone has their liking and disliking. Everyone has their own talents. But see, what is common is the cause for all the talents and all the liking and all the disliking is that all pervading principle. The Ishvara, the Lord himself. So Brahman, the all pervading self, with his power of Maya becomes the almighty Creator Ishwara.\n\nWith this Maya, he creates this world of plurality. So I myself, with my power of dreaming, I create my own world of dream. While I'm dreaming, I'm by myself. The dream is me. The people in the dream are me. The dreamer himself is also me.\n\nThere is no other entity. Only when I wake up, I realize that there were not actually other people around. There were no different sceneries around. So this is like it is in Ishwara's mind, a great dream. So therefore he said Brahmayan Sarva Bhutani Yantra Rudhani Maya. By this elusive power of Ishvara, each individual in this world is functioning compulsively.\n\nDriven by their own temperaments and qualities. So therefore he says Tamevasharanam gacha. So now the advice, having understood that people will be different: you are different from everybody else. Do not try to compare yourself with others and don't try to copy them. You find your own bearings, what is good for you, what you like.\n\nContinue functioning, but keep the Lord in mind -- that he is Almighty. He is making me do all these things and therefore I am offering everything I do to Him. Tamevasharanam gacha. Take refuge in that Ishvara, that Almighty, all-pervading consciousness. Sarva bhavena Bharata -- in all your being, with all your thoughts, whether thinking about your professional life, your relationships, everything.\n\nWhile you are thinking, put him in the center of it -- all these things are only possible because of Him. Take refuge in him that you are the ones who is enabling me to function in this world as an individual. Tat Prasada paramsanthim Sthanam prapsi Saswatam. If you take refuge in him with all your being, with all your thoughts, no matter what that is, offer it to him that I can only think this way because of you. I can only act this way because of you. Once you start assigning all credits to him, then you are relieved.\n\nYou have no responsibilities. So in the end Bhagavan said this individualized ego which is identifying with this body, mind and intellect and taking credit for what I'm doing, thinking that I'm the doer. If you just keep that aside, do everything that you are doing right now exactly as you are doing. Because you are doing it as per your nature. You are propelled by your nature to do it. If you try to resist your nature, it creates distortion, a kind of mental disease.\n\nSo keep doing what you are doing. Just keep in mind Tamevasharanam Gacha, Sarva Bhavya Bharata. Just take refuge in Him. Make your identification with him versus this limited body, mind and intellect. Tat prasadat paramshantin sthan praapasi Saswatam. The grace is when the identification is complete then I obviously become one with him, his qualities become my qualities.\n\nI start thinking, \"I now have access to his capacities.\" You joined a company a day before, and from the next day onwards you're part of the company -- all the resources of the company are yours. You take the brochure of the company and go to a new client and say, \"I represent IBM.\" All of IBM's resources are your resources. But before that, a day before, when you had not joined the company yet, you didn't have that brochure from IBM.\n\nYou are just an individual. You can say, \"I can do this,\" and that doesn't really mean much. Once you attach yourself to the resources of the Great, all his resources become your resources; all the qualifications of that company become your qualifications. Once you identify with him and take refuge in him Tat Prasad with his grace you will achieve that Santisthanam Propyasi Sastvatam. You will find that eternal peace and a firm abode. All you have to do is just take refuge in him and continue doing what you are doing as per your own nature.\n\nItite Gnanam Akhyatam Guhyat Guhyatram Maya Vimrushyat Ashe. We have discussed this thing in detail from chapter two onward. We have analyzed every point. In the end, I came down to this: just follow your own Dharma, your own nature. You will not incur any sin.\n\nDo not worry about what other people are doing, do not copy them. Your welfare is in following your own Dharma and giving up your ego and attachment. And I will take care of everything else. I told you this very secret of knowledge. \"Secret\" means it was hidden from you. It was right there, but hidden from you.\n\nBecause of your likes and dislikes, your vasanas, your ignorance, you were not able to see this. I took those coverings away from you so that you can see the knowledge as it is. I told you in its entirety. Vimrushya Etat Ashesena. Reflect on it in its totality. Don't take a verse here and there from Bhagavad Gita.",
      "reflection": "Verse 61 reveals a profound truth: ishvara sarva-bhutanam hrid-deshe - the Lord dwells in the hearts of all beings, causing them to revolve as if mounted on a machine (yantra) by the power of Maya. This image combines divine immanence with the mechanical quality of conditioned existence. The Lord is not distant but intimately present in every heart, yet Maya creates the illusion of separate, automatic beings driven by their programming. We are simultaneously divine at core and conditioned at the surface.\n\nVerse 62 delivers the instruction: tam eva sharanam gaccha sarva-bhavena - go to Him alone for refuge with your whole being. The result: tat-prasadat param shantim sthanam prapsyasi shashvatam - by His grace you will attain supreme peace and the eternal abode. Verse 63 concludes Krishna's teaching: I have declared to you this knowledge, the most secret of all secrets. Reflect on it fully, then do as you wish (yathecchasi tatha kuru). This final freedom is remarkable - after all instruction, the choice remains with Arjuna.\n\nThe teaching honors your autonomy while pointing to the truth. Today, contemplate the reality that Ishvara dwells in your heart right now - not as a visitor but as the very core of your being. The sense of being a separate mechanism driven by forces beyond your control is Maya's creation. Beneath that programming lies the Lord. Take refuge there - not as an escape from life but as a grounding that transforms how you engage with life. And remember: after receiving all teaching, the choice remains yours. What will you choose today?"

Some are very sattvic, some are very tamasic and most of us are somewhere in between. Therefore find out what your real nature is. Bhagawan said this is a fact that each one has his or her own qualities and temperaments. So depending on your temperament, now you have to find the field of activity which is appropriate for you.\n\nSo earlier in chapter three, Bhagavan said Swadharma Nidhanam Shreya Paradharma Bhayavahah -- working in your own nature is better, because another's dharma is frightening. If you try to do something against your nature, it will be very frightening. You will always be a fish out of water. You are a very artistic person and you want to run a business -- you will be a fish out of water.\n\nYou will not feel comfortable. So therefore find your own Dharma and then work in it. So in this chapter again he reminds us what is good for you. So he said that Sriyan Swadharmo Vigunaha, Paradharma, Swanushti daat. Your Dharma alone is good for you, even though it has faults. It may not be as pristine as others, but this is what your nature is and it is good for you.\n\nAnd therefore Sahajam, Karma, kaunteh. So find the field of activities which come naturally to you. Do the activities which come naturally to you. You shall not incur any sin in doing so. You shall not incur any sin. Continue doing what you like, what comes naturally to you.\n\nAnd do not worry about whether I'll incur any sin or I'll incur any wrong tendencies. We have learnt in the previous chapter that no matter what your tendencies are and what activities you are performing, you start with Om Tatsat, purify them. So in chapter 17 we have learned that no matter what your Saddha is, whether it is Sattvic, whether it is, whether it is Raja Sikh, whether it is Tamasic, you are acting in that manner. But rather than worrying about whether it is Sattvik, Rajasik, or Tamasik, do whatever is natural to you. But whatever you do, start with Aum. Every activity which you do, remember him, that he is almighty and all pervading.\n\nAnd he is enabling me to do this activity. So start with Om and say end with Tat, that this is not for me, this is for you. There is nothing that I am doing it for myself because I am not even capable of doing anything. He is all pervading and everything I am doing, I am offering to him because he made me do this. So Bhagawan said, with that attitude, when you perform any actions in the field of your liking which come naturally to you, you will find your happiness. We try everything and we get frustrated.\n\nThat's because we say, one, you are not pursuing your own Dharma and secondly, you think you are doing it for yourself. Those two things, if you correct them -- find the field of activities which is natural to you, and then don't expect anything from it -- Then Bhagavan said that you will be relieved from these sorrows and unhappiness. In spite of all this diversity which we see in this world, there is a profound unity. Iswarahas, Sarvabhutanam, Prudeshe, Arjuna, Tisthati.\n\nHe said, this is why you should offer everything to him and remember him all the time. Even though you find yourself to be very different from others, even though you find all these people are very different from each other, there's one thing very common. They are all functioning because of that one single principle functioning through them. There are not several consciousnesses -- mine different from yours, yours different from hers, hers different from his. One consciousness functioning through all. Depending on the quality of the equipment, outer behavior will be different from each other.\n\nJust as we have used these examples many many times. This room space is dependent on the conditioning. How far the walls are from each other and how far the ceiling is from the floor. But the space is the same space as it is outside. The space outside and space inside is no different same. All pervading space is in each room in this universe.\n\nWherever you find a space which is confined by limitations, the space is universal. The same way, Isvara Sarva Bhutanam Hrudeshe Tishtati -- the core of all being is the Ishvara himself residing there. Because of his presence only, things are functioning. But how are they functioning? Bhramayan Sarva Bhutani Yantra Rudhani Mayaya -- by his illusive power Maya, everyone is functioning in this world.\n\nThey are functioning because of Iswara's presence and his power of Maya. The elusive power Brahmayan Sarvabhoot are Yantra Rudhani. It seems like they are just mounted on a machine, helpless to act in this world. We are driven by our own likes and dislikes and vasanas almost compulsively. Whether we like it or not. We see something which is of our liking, we will be attracted towards it.\n\nSomething which is of not conducive, we will be staying away from it. Bhagavan said everybody is propelled by this Maya as if they are helpless. But at the core of all being, Ishvara is the cause for all beings functioning in this world. Keep that unity in mind. So this is a profound revelation. We knew that everybody is different from each other.\n\nEveryone has their own qualities. Everyone has their liking and disliking. Everyone has their own talents. But see, what is common is the cause for all the talents and all the liking and all the disliking is that all pervading principle. The Ishvara, the Lord himself. So Brahman, the all pervading self, with his power of Maya becomes the almighty Creator Ishwara.\n\nWith this Maya, he creates this world of plurality. So I myself, with my power of dreaming, I create my own world of dream. While I'm dreaming, I'm by myself. Even the dream is me. The people in the dream is me. In the dreamer himself is also me.\n\nThere is no other entity. Only when I wake up, I realize that there are not too many people around. There were no different sceneries around. So this is like it is in Ishwara's mind, a great dream. So therefore he said Brahmayan Sarva Bhutani Yantra Rudhani Maya. By this elusive power of Ishvara, each individual in this world is functioning compulsively.\n\nDriven by their own temperaments and qualities. So therefore he says Tamevasharanam gacha. So now the advice, having understood that people will be different: you are different from everybody else. Do not try to compare yourself with others and don't try to copy them. You find your own bearings, what is good for you, what you like.\n\nContinue functioning, but keep the Lord in mind -- that he is Almighty. He is making me do all these things and therefore I am offering everything I do to Him. Tamevasharanam gacha. Take refuge in that Ishvara, that Almighty, all-pervading consciousness. Sarva bhavena Bharata -- in all your being, with all your thoughts, whether thinking about your professional life, your relationships, everything.\n\nWhile you are thinking, put him in the center of it -- all these things are only possible because of Him. Take refuge in him that you are the ones who is enabling me to function in this world as an individual. Tat Prasada paramsanthim Sthanam prapsi Saswatam. If you take refuge in him with all your being, with all your thoughts, no matter what that is, offer it to him that I can only think this way because of you. I can only act this way because of you. Once you start assigning all credits to him, then you are relieved.\n\nYou have no responsibilities. So in the end Bhagavan said this individualized ego which is identifying with this body, mind and intellect and taking credit for what I'm doing, thinking that I'm the doer. If you just keep that aside, do everything that you are doing right now exactly as you are doing. Because you are doing it as per your nature. You are propelled by your nature to do it. If you try to resist your nature, it creates distortion, a kind of mental disease.\n\nSo keep doing what you are doing. Just keep in mind Tamevasharanam Gacha, Sarva Bhavya Bharata. Just take refuge in Him. Make your identification with him versus this limited body, mind and intellect. Tat prasadat paramshantin sthan praapasi Saswatam. The grace is when the identification is complete then I obviously become one with him, his qualities become my qualities.\n\nI start thinking, \"I now have access to his capacities.\" You joined a company a day before, and from the next day onwards you're part of the company -- all the resources of the company are yours. You take the brochure of the company and go to a new client and say, \"I represent IBM.\" All of IBM's resources are your resources. But before that, a day before, when you had not joined the company yet, you didn't have that brochure from IBM.\n\nYou are just an individual. You can say, \"I can do this,\" and that doesn't really mean much. Once you attach yourself to the resources of the Great, all his resources become your resources; all the qualifications of that company become your qualifications. Once you identify with him and take refuge in him Tat Prasad with his grace you will achieve that Santisthanam Propyasi Sastvatam. You will find that eternal peace and a firm abode. All you have to do is just take refuge in him and continue doing what you are doing as per your own nature.\n\nItite Gnanam Akhyatam Guhyat Guhyatram Maya Vimrushyat Ashe. We have discussed this thing in detail from chapter two onward. We have analyzed every point. In the end I came down and told you: just follow your own Dharma, your own nature. You will not incur any sin.\n\nDo not worry about what other people are doing, do not copy them. Your welfare is in following your own Dharma and giving up your ego and attachment. And I will take care of everything else. I told you this very secret of knowledge. \"Secret\" means it was hidden from you. It was right there but hidden from you.\n\nBecause of my own likes and dislikes, my vasanas, my ignorance, I was not able to see this. I took that coverings away from you so that you can see the knowledge as is. I told you in its entirety. Vimrushya Etit Asena. Reflect on it in its totality. Don't take a verse here and there from Bhagavad Gita.",
      "reflection": "These verses contain the Gita's supreme teaching. Verse 64 establishes the context: because you are dear to Me, I will speak for your welfare the most secret of all. Verse 65 gives the complete instruction: man-mana bhava mad-bhakto mad-yaji mam namaskuru - fix your mind on Me, be My devotee, worship Me, bow to Me. The promise: mam evaishyasi satyam - you shall come to Me truly, I promise you, for you are dear to Me. This is love speaking to love.\n\nVerse 66 is the charama-shloka, the ultimate verse: sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam sharanam vraja - abandoning all dharmas, take refuge in Me alone. Aham tva sarva-papebhyo mokshayishyami - I shall liberate you from all sins; do not grieve. This is not abandonment of ethical conduct but transcendence of all limited identifications. Every role we play comes with its dharma - parent, professional, citizen. These are necessary but partial. The instruction is to ultimately take refuge in the One beyond all roles.\n\nThis is the heart of surrender: not passive resignation but active trust in the Source of all. The promise \"I shall liberate you from all sins\" addresses our deepest fear - that our past mistakes have permanently damaged us. They have not. Grace is more powerful than karma. Today, practice this surrender: acknowledge the various dharmas you carry, the roles and their obligations. Then, beneath all these, find the One to whom they are all offered. Say inwardly: \"I take refuge in You alone.\" Notice the peace that comes when the burden of being the sole doer is released. Ma shuchah - do not grieve."

      "commentary": "Discussing chapter 18, Moksha Sannyasa Yoga -- Yoga of Liberation through Renunciation. We are at the conclusion of Bhagavad Gita, and in this chapter Bhagawan has stated a few simple facts which we already know. We have discussed them before and also experienced them in our life. Something as simple as this: in this world, people have different temperaments. Not all people are alike. Each one has his or her own temperament. Depending on that temperament, he may be good at one thing or another. Everybody is not good at everything, but depending on your temperament, you may be good at something.\n\nAnd also this temperament will make you like some things and dislike other things. So this temperament is your own nature or your personality. Therefore, because in this world the different people have different personalities, different temperaments, they do different things. Some are good at scholarly pursuits and some are good at doing heroic things and some are good at creating wealth and some are just happy serving others, you may find yourself to be somewhere in this spectrum. Not everybody likes same type of coffee. Some like strong, some like very mild.\n\nOthers may be somewhere in between. So you will find yourself somewhere in the spectrum of temperament. Some are very sattvic, some are very tamasic and most of us are somewhere in between. Therefore find out what your real nature is. Bhagawan said this is a fact that each one has his or her own qualities and temperaments. So depending on your temperament, now you have to find the field of activity which is appropriate for you.\n\nSo earlier in chapter three, Bhagavan said Swadharma Nidhanam Shreya Paradharma Bhayavahah -- working in your own nature is better, because another's dharma is frightening.

      "reflection": "These verses address the transmission of knowledge. Verse 67 specifies to whom this teaching should NOT be given: na atapaskaya (one without discipline), na abhaktaya (one without devotion), na ashushrusha (one unwilling to serve/listen), and one who abhyasuyati (cavils or finds fault). This is not exclusion but wisdom - teaching reaches only those prepared to receive it. Forcing spiritual knowledge on unprepared minds creates neither understanding nor transformation.\n\nVerses 68-69 describe the supreme service: teaching this knowledge to sincere devotees is the highest form of worship, and no one is dearer to Krishna than one who shares this wisdom. This is the concept of jnana-yajna - the sacrifice of knowledge. Swami Chinmayananda embodied this teaching through the study group movement, recognizing that teaching multiplies understanding both for teacher and student.\n\nConsider: What knowledge have you received that is meant to be shared? Not everyone is ready - verse 67's criteria apply. But among those who show discipline, devotion, and willingness to learn, you have something to offer. Today, reflect on one insight from your spiritual journey that has genuinely helped you. Identify one person in your life who might benefit and is ready to receive. The teaching need not be formal - a conversation, a recommended reading, a shared practice. The Gita promises that sharing wisdom with ready students is the highest devotion. What will you share, and with whom?"

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 18, Moksha Sannyasa Yoga, Yoga of Liberation through Renunciation. This is the last chapter in Bhagavad Gita, and Bhagavan has given his final advice to us. It boils down to Sreyan Swadharma Vigunaha Paradharma Swanashti da. Your own Dharma is better for you than other dharma. And therefore he says, Sahajam Karma Kamateja Sadosham Abhiyana Tej. These are the two basic facts.\n\nHe pointed out to us that your welfare is in staying within your Dharma, whatever Dharma you have acquired through your own choice. My dharma as an architect -- I chose it myself. I decided to go to architecture school and therefore I became an architect. Bhagavan said, your welfare is in your Dharma. Don't try to practice something other than what you're good at. Then there was Sahajam Karma Kaunteya.\n\nDo what comes naturally to you. Because of all your experiences and vasanas and tendencies and your training, there are few things in life which comes easier for you. And others don't stay with what comes naturally to you, even though other things look more glamorous, more glorious. But you say, even if your Dharma, you found it Sadosha Mapi, even there are some defects in it or not very perfect. Do actions in your own field which come naturally to you. There are the only two things he said, doing so you will overcome all your obstacles and you will never incur sin.\n\nWorking in the field which come naturally to you, keeping your own goal in mind that I'm doing it to get my ultimate happiness. But once you will never incur sin. Sin, as we have discussed, is a negative impression on my mind which creates agitations. All we are looking for in life is peace. Give me peace of mind. Peace of mind only comes when the mind is tranquil.\n\nBecause the mind will only be tranquil if you're working according to your own Dharma. And then he said the final advice after completing his entire discourse: now you do whatever you think is right for you. He gave you the complete choice one more time and said, let me summarize what I told you. Manmana Bhava mad Bhaktaha Madhya ji Mam namaskuruhu. In other words, Krishna said, if you want to summarize the entire teachings of Bhagavad Gita in half a verse, this is it.\n\nTo get the happiness which you are looking for, fix your mind onto me -- me, the all-pervading almighty self which is also your self. Focus your mind on that mad Bhaktah worship that identify with that Madhya Ji. Offer all your actions to me. Offer all your actions to the highest goal which you have when you go to the first grade. I'm learning this and that.\n\nBecause eventually I want to become a doctor. My granddaughter was telling me yesterday, I have two inventions I want to release before I became a doctor. So there is an ultimate goal in mind. That ultimate goal is to find perfect happiness. Perfect happiness is only there if my mind is tranquil. Bhagawan said, Madhya Ji, offer everything to me Maam namaskurohu and take refuge in me.\n\nThen he clarified say Sarva Dharma and parity. Aham TVA Sarva Papebiha Moksa Kshya minasucha. Right now you think that you are incomplete. You have lots of baggage -- all your incompleteness and sins, the things which you have not done right. \"I have not done this thing right in my life.\"\n\nBhagawan said, no, you cannot correct yourself on your own. But if you take refuge in me, I can correct that. Sarva Dharman Parityajya. And we have discussed this Sarva Dharman. Every role that I take, it comes with its own Dharma.\n\nEvery role a drama actor plays, it comes with its own requirement. Now if I start identifying with each role, then I'll get confused. I will have a nervous breakdown. I will have a personality disorder. I don't know who I am. Am I a king or a pauper?\n\nBecause I play so many different roles. The Bhagawan says, in your life, you take on too many of these roles. All those roles come with their own Dharma. My Dharma as a father. My Dharma as an architect. My Dharma as a husband.\n\nMy Dharma as a citizen of this country. My Dharma as an employer. All those Dharmas -- if I get bogged down into them and think that they will give me my happiness, then I'll be completely shattered. I do not really know which role is more important than others. Keep working in that dharma when you are there.\n\nWhen you are an architect, act as an architect. When you are father, act as a father. But at the end of the day, you realize that you are something other than all the roles which you play. An actor in Beverly Hills knows that he is something other than the roles he plays. So Bhagawanja Sarva Dharma and Paritya Jya. At the end of the day, give up.\n\nAll those dharmas are not yours. But they belong to the roles which you play. While you're playing that role, you can't give up those dharmas. But once you're out of that role, leave those dharmas with that role and focus on who you are. Who is there One constant in all these roles which has its own dharma. So Bhagawan says, ma makeam sharam Braja.\n\nIdentify with that one single entity which is pervading through all the roles which you play. Ahamtva Sarva Pape bihamoksik Shami Mashu chah. Once you identify with that, all the limitations you have in each one of those roles are of no consequence because it only belongs to the role. You may not have played the role correctly. Fine, let's move on to the next one. One movie gets flopped, the actor doesn't get shattered.\n\nHe moves on to another one, waiting for the next hit. Don't get caught up in any of those roles as that's the only thing which is mine. And if I fail there, I have failed in it. Bhagavan said, you don't worry. Once you take refuge in your own self, everything will be alright. Now that you have learnt this knowledge, don't just sit back and relax.\n\nThat's not where your duty ends. You have to do your part. Now that you were privileged enough to know what is right, you also have an obligation to teach others what is right. And I, the parent, was a son at one point of time. And I got the advice from my parents and they told me what is right and wrong. I made my life right or wrong according to that.\n\nAnd now I learned after my experience what is right and wrong. I have an obligation to pass on that knowledge to my children. Ya Imam paramam guhiyam mad bhakteshu abhi dashyathi bhakti mai param kutva Mama eva isyati asansaya. He said, there is one who declares this, teaches this knowledge of mine to my devotees, not to the people who are not interested in it, but those who are inspired themselves to make their life better, make their life appropriate, remove all the negatives from their life, but they still do not know how to do it. When you find those enthusiastic students, that's what you want to teach them. Therefore I said, the one who teaches this sacred knowledge of mind to my Bhakta, those who are devoted to this knowledge, Bhakti mai param kutva maam eva Eshyati asansayaha.\n\nI consider that he is worshipping me. Bhagavan said, you don't have to come to my temple every day and put $1 in the Aarti or to do anything special. The greatest devotion we can offer to our teacher is to carry the torch of his knowledge. That's why we do Pada Puja. Because the platform on which my Guru is standing that the platform which I worship, that knowledge is important. Bhagawan said, one who spread this knowledge of mine which I gave it to you, to others, I consider him to be my devotee and therefore he will come to me without any doubt.\n\nHe will become one with me or Sansayah. No other thing needed. Bhagavan said, you just continue. You learn this knowledge, practice it, and then pass it on to the others. That Bhagavan said, I consider to my greatest devotion. So basically it encourages all of us, whatever little we have learned from Bhagavad Gita.\n\nThere is an obligation to impart the knowledge to someone else who is curious to know. He may not have the right frame of understanding, but he wants to know. You have an obligation to give him that knowledge. Bhagawan says, Nachatasmat manushesu kaschinmi priyakrutamaha. None other than that person who carries this torch of knowledge is dearer to me than him. He is the closest to me because he's carrying forward the mission that I have -- that I want to correct the misunderstanding in people.\n\nYou were confused, Arjuna. I gave you this discourse so that you can now act in your life correctly. Now you have an obligation to do that to someone else who you will find it in the same situation. And I consider that as my worship that you have appreciated what I have given you. And such a person is dearer to me. Some other people may come and other things for me, but they are of lesser value than you carrying forward my mission.\n\nBhavita Nachame tasmat anyaha Priyatara Bhuvi, not only now, but even in future, there won't be anyone who is dearer to me than the one who is spreading this knowledge to make this world better and spreading the right knowledge. So Swamiji points out here that we have this misconception in our Hinduism -- that we obviously don't convert people, we don't encourage people to come to our fold. In fact, we discourage people: \"If someone has to be Hindu, you can't become a Hindu unless you're born Hindu.\" Swamiji says Sri Bhagawan clearly points out that that's not part of our culture.\n\nWe do not want forced conversion. We don't want to tell people who have not yet understood to believe in this knowledge. Give him his own time. Because forced conversion, forced imposition, never works in reality anywhere. Therefore you say, find people who are willing to understand this and give this knowledge. That's your obligation.\n\nSo that's a kind of missionary work. They never said that this knowledge should never be given out to anybody, or that it should not be given to people who are not from this class or the other. Simply: find the right person, the right group of people who are anxious to make their lives better. Give this knowledge to them. I'll consider that the greatest devotion to me. And he said, such a person is dear to me not only now, but this will never change.\n\nIt's not that right now I'm telling you this, but in the future it may be something different. It will hold true throughout history: whoever spreads his teacher's knowledge is the greatest devotee, and that is the greatest Guru Dakshina one can give to his teacher.\n\nNow, let's say you consider that you are not capable of spreading this knowledge -- you don't have the resources, you don't have the temperament, you don't consider yourself worthy of doing so. But if you just listen to this: Adhyeshyate Cha Imam Dharmyam Samvadam Avayoho. This dialogue of ours, this sacred dialogue which deals with who you are in reality and who you are not, how to act in this world so that you can achieve your ultimate goal.\n\nThis dialogue which we had, which is sacred, even if you just study that listening is slightly different than studying one who studies this.",
      "reflection": "These verses address studying and listening to the Gita. Verse 70: one who studies this dharmya-samvada (sacred dialogue) worships through jnana-yajna (knowledge-sacrifice). Verse 71: even one who merely listens with shraddha (faith) and without anasuya (fault-finding) becomes liberated and reaches the auspicious worlds of the righteous. Verse 72 is Krishna's final question to Arjuna: Have you listened with one-pointed mind? Has your delusion born of ignorance been destroyed?\n\nThe distinction between studying and listening is significant. Studying is active engagement - reading, contemplating, discussing. Listening is receptive - allowing the teaching to enter without immediate analysis or judgment. Both are valid paths. The key qualifier for listening is shraddha (faith) and absence of anasuya (carping criticism). Coming to spiritual teachings looking for flaws prevents any transmission. Coming with openness allows transformation.\n\nHow do you engage with spiritual teachings? Are you a student - actively working with the material, questioning, applying? Or a listener - receptively allowing wisdom to seep in? Both have value. Today, try the approach less natural to you. If you typically analyze, simply listen without judgment. If you typically receive passively, actively wrestle with one teaching. And honestly ask yourself Krishna's question: Has your ignorance-born delusion been dispelled? If confusion remains, that is honest and workable. But if there is pretense of understanding without genuine transformation, that is the real obstacle."

      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 18, Moksa Sannyasa Yoga. Yoga of Liberation through renunciation. Liberating yourself from all that is binding you. What is binding me is my limitations. I'm limiting myself by associating with my body, mind and intellectual. So in the end, Bhagavan Samara says, sarva Dharma Parityajya Maam Ekam Sharanam Praja.\n\nGive up your dependence on your body, mind and intellect as the source of your happiness. That eternal happiness which you are seeking, you are right now dependent on your body, mind and intellect. I'll gain through my power, I'll gain through my intellect. I'll gain through my manipulating the others. Bhagavan said, give up all those and just take refuge in me, the source, the self, the consciousness. And I will take care of all your sins.\n\nAll the things which you have as negative impressions, I will take care of. I will wipe them out and make you clean so that you can experience the joy which is your nature. This is praptasya pravtvi. This is something which we already have. All we have to do is clear that which is veiling that happiness. So we concluded the discourse on Bhagavad Gita.\n\nBhagavan also said who you should not be teaching this knowledge to. One who does not have any discipline. One who does not have any devotion towards this knowledge. One who has no sense of service to others -- in other words, someone so self-centered. Such a person will not be able to learn anything from you because he's so self-centered.\n\nThen lastly he said, the one who cavils at this knowledge or at me -- if I do not have any faith in any idea, I will never be able to learn. In Gujarati, when a child is crying for a long time, they say \"Asu ragda tyanay\" -- \"Ragada\" means \"raga tana,\" pulling. \"Why are you pulling all these ragas?\" You know why they said that? There was a kind of contempt against the people who perform classical music and go on and on.\n\nSo when somebody has no appreciation for classical music, they associate it with babies crying: \"Why are you doing ragada?\" That's cavilling towards that art -- having no respect for it. Sometimes, you know, people go for a dance program and say, \"So how was it?\" \"The same old South Indian dancing all the time.\" Because they were looking for Bollywood dancing, and it turned out to be a Kathak classical dancing concert.\n\nBecause they have no appreciation for the art. I have seen the Ghatapata -- the discourse about Vedanta where they use the analogy of the pot. Ghata Pata, Ghatapada -- in Bombay they say \"Garbhad Karta,\" right? Ghatapata became \"Gadbar.\" No appreciation for that discussion or discourse. Now such a person -- if you try to teach him the same thing, one who says \"Garbhad\" -- you try to teach him Vedanta, it will not work.\n\nOne who says \"Vairu Ragda,\" he will not learn music. He has no appreciation for it. So Bhagavan says such a person, you should not be teaching this Bhagavad Gita. He has to come to a level where he has disciplined himself. He has devotion for this knowledge and he has a sense of service. In essence, he does not think about his own good but sees oneness with others.\n\nThat's how we do service. We can only serve somebody whom we revere, appreciate, or love. For one who has none of this for this knowledge, you should not be teaching that to him. On the other hand, Bhagavan said, if you have learned this knowledge -- by God's grace you got this chance to learn this precious knowledge from your teacher -- you should share it with others. Do not be self-centered.\n\nIf you're a Christian who comes and asks me, that's fine. You don't just become a scholar; share this with others. This is the concept of franchising, right? You have a concept and give it to others. That's how it grows into a huge multinational. Otherwise selling burger, how can that be a big business?\n\nIt is the simplest thing in the world. Take a bun and put a patty in between. Put little lettuce, tomato and ketchup, you're done. But it's a multinational entity. Because the concept of franchising. Somebody asked Einstein, is there anything baffles you in this world?\n\nHe said, the concept of compound interest. Somebody demonstrated to me: if you get one penny the first day, then it doubles the next day, and you keep doubling pennies -- versus I give you a million dollars right away -- which one in 20 years will be greater? He demonstrates that the doubling pennies will be worth millions of dollars. The compound interest. So compounding this knowledge for the greater good of society -- it is every student's duty to share this with others.\n\nThose who are interested and are worthy. So therefore Bhagavan said, such a person will certainly will come to me now. Teaching this subject which you have learnt, you become master at it. After a while you become one with that subject. If you learn music, then continue teaching music. You will become a master of it.\n\nBecause you are practicing more and more and more by every time you teach to somebody else. So Bhagavan says, such a person will certainly come to me. He will become me in a sense he will attain that oneness he is seeking with his own supreme self. So Bhagavan is actively asking you to go out and teach others. How did Swami Chinmayananda become a Jagat Guru? By introducing the idea of the study group.\n\nIf he had just said \"come to my lecture,\" we would have gone to his lectures and left. I did that for a long time. I met Swamiji when I was 17 years old. First I just went to his lectures, because in India I did not know about study groups. When I came to the USA, the first series I attended in 1983, I had no idea about study groups. But Swamiji said at the end of the Gita Yajna that those of you who are interested must now attend a study group. And I said, \"What is a study group?\"\n\nSo Gaurang Nanavati from Houston called me up because I had filled out that form. I had no interest really in joining a study group, because I was thinking, \"Who else other than Swami Chinmayananda can teach me this?\" But because Swamiji said it, I had that little Shraddha -- I must go. And that's how I went to a study group. This is where I started truly learning Bhagavad Gita, not from Swamiji's lectures.\n\nSo the idea of these study groups has made Chinmaya Mission a great organization in sharing this knowledge. The idea came from Bhagavan Sri Krishna: share your knowledge. Bhagavan said, such a person will certainly achieve the goal he's seeking. Then he said, there is no one in this world who is closer to me than the one who is teaching this Bhagavad Gita with Shraddha, with having supreme faith in me, in this knowledge.\n\nYou cannot teach something if you are not convinced about it. You can only convince others. If you are convinced about it with conviction. One who teaches this Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavan says, I don't think there's anyone who is dearer to me, anyone who is nearer to me than that person. Because he came closest to the goal of becoming one with that universal self. So Bhagavan has glorified the teachers and the teachings.\n\nAnd then he said, Adhyeshyate Cha Imam Dharmyam Samvadam Avayoho Gnana Yagnena Tena Aham Ishtaha Syam Iti Me Matihi. Now the student -- is there anything beneficial in just learning? One who studies this dialogue of ours about Dharma. This dialogue, Bhagavad Gita, all 18 chapters of it -- this is a dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna. So Krishna is telling Arjuna: this, our dialogue about Dharma.\n\nWhat is right, what is wrong, what is real, what is unreal. Who studies such a person? I consider that such a person is worshipping me through Gnani Yajna. He may not be a Krishna Bhakta. He may not be doing Sri Krishna, Shranham, Sri Krishna, Shrana, Sri Krishna. He may not be going to the temple at all.\n\nHe may not bow down at Krishna's statue in the temple. But Bhagavan said -- it is not that I will consider or not consider -- it is my conviction that such a person is worshipping me through Gnana Yajna. So the student who is studying Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavan said, is directly worshipping me. And we have learnt in Bhagavad Gita previously: how do you serve your teacher?\n\nBy living the ideal the teacher teaches is the best service to your teacher. Your teacher teaches you music and you don't do anything about it. But just keep giving him fees and never learned music. Is that a service to him? It may make his living. But he is not very proud of you.\n\nBut my teacher teaches me something and I excel in it. And then propagate that knowledge even further. He will be very proud when he hears about you. Even today, if you go and tell Gaurangbhai that you went to Neelkant's class -- you know why? He is my teacher. When he hears that, he knows that after all these years, Neelkant is still into Bhagavad Gita, has not given up.\n\nThat's a service to your teacher. So Bhagavan said, such a person, I'll consider that he's serving me directly. He's worshipping me directly through Gnana Yoga word Yajna Signifies sacrificial fire is invoked and devotees are offering oblations in it. You see here, the fire of knowledge is kindled by your studies and you are offering your ignorance into it. Up till now what I considered me and now no, it is not me. So my ignorance about myself, which in common language we call ego is what we are offering into this Gnar Yajna.\n\nTherefore, Bhagavan said, I am convinced, I'm convicted that such a person is worshipping me through Gnan Yajna. So the student is glorified here. Then the next verse says, okay, but what about somebody who is not even studying? We have heard this before -- there is a difference between reading and studying. Swamiji explained: you read a newspaper.\n\nYou really have no other interest but to get some information what's going on? So you are reading newspaper, but you study your subject. I have to study because I want to know the knowledge. So not just reading Bhagavad Gita. So just chanting Bhagavad Gita may or may not do much good to you. But studying Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavan said, I'm convinced that you are worshipping me through Gnani Yajna.\n\nBut what if I'm not studying? Shraddha Vaan Anasuyash Cha Shrunuyat Api Yo Naraha. A person who is listening to this knowledge -- he may not be studying intently, he may not be reading Bhagavad Gita. But he's listening to the discourse about Bhagavad Gita, about the knowledge of Bhagavad Gita from a Sadguru.\n\nBut you have to have faith in it. You're not just listening to find out what it is all about. With Shraddha -- when we listen to somebody like the Dalai Lama or Sri Sri Ravi Shankar or somebody in whom we have Shraddha -- we are intently listening to what he's saying. We're trying to understand the message behind it. That's Shraddha Vaan Anasuya. He's not listening to find out what is wrong in it.\n\nAs we had heard before, Max Muller and those scholars were given grants by European powers to go and study Sanskrit -- to find out what all this \"garbage\" was that they were teaching their people, and then tell them that it was all wrong. That's Anasuya -- cavilling at that knowledge. But if you are not doing it for that reason -- and it turns out that Max Muller became probably the greatest scholar because he probably had the real intention, even though his sponsors may not have -- then such a person who is just listening to this discourse about Bhagavad Gita, the knowledge of Bhagavad Gita, So Api Muktaha -- he also will get liberated.",
      "reflection": "Verse 73 is Arjuna's triumphant response: nashto moha smritir labdha - my delusion is destroyed, my memory is restored. By Your grace, I stand firm with doubts dispelled. I shall do Your bidding. This is the complete transformation from chapter one's paralyzed, despairing warrior to a clarity-filled instrument ready for action. Smritir labdha - memory restored - refers to remembering his true nature, which ignorance had obscured.\n\nVerses 74-75 shift to Sanjaya, the narrator, who expresses his own wonder: through Vyasa's grace, I heard this secret yoga directly from Krishna, the Lord of Yoga. This acknowledges the lineage of transmission - from Krishna to Arjuna, witnessed by Sanjaya through Vyasa's blessing. Knowledge flows through prepared channels, each receiving according to their capacity.\n\nArjuna's transformation is available to each of us. The starting point - confusion, paralysis, conflicting duties - is universal. The path - listening with attention, receiving with faith, contemplating with discrimination - is accessible. The destination - nashto moha, smritir labdha - is the same: delusion destroyed, true nature remembered. Today, ask yourself: What delusion still clouds my understanding? What truth about myself have I forgotten? The Gita promises that with sustained engagement and grace, the clouds part. Gata-sandeha karishye vachanam tava - doubt-free, I shall act according to truth. This is the goal: not escape from action but action rooted in clarity."

      ],
      "commentary": "So we had been discussing chapter 18, Moksa Sannyas Yoga. We have come to the final concluding portion where Bhagavan has concluded his portion. Arjuna has confirmed that he is now completely in control of himself. His delusion is gone. He regained his memory. In other words, what is right and what is wrong, what needs to be done and what's to be avoided and what his real self is.\n\nI'm now ready to do whatever you have asked me to do. In other words, I'm now ready to follow your instruction in Bhagavad Gita, which I have learnt so far from you. So I will now fight this war. Basically, when we are deluded and somebody gives advice and we are now ready to face the challenges of life, then we say, don't worry, I'm now ready. I will fight this battle. That's where Arjuna is now.\n\nAnd the only other two people who are participating in this was Sanjaya, sitting in Dhritarashtra's palace. Dhritarashtra, the blind king, who is somewhat a cause for this conflict. Had he done what needed to be done for him as a king, we wouldn't have the situation of these two armies facing each other. Because of his blindness, his ignorance about what is right and wrong, the situation led to this battle of the war. So he's sitting in his palace. Sanjay, his charioteer or the personal assistant, had narrated what was going on between the Krishna and Arjuna.\n\nAs we had discussed before, this was only possible because Bhagavan Ved Vyas, in his last-ditch effort to stop this war, goes to Dhritarashtra and says, \"You need to stop this. For you to see what's happening, I can give you a divine vision. This will lead to a disaster for the Kauravas.\" But Dhritarashtra was not comfortable, so he said, \"I do not want this vision. Give it to my secretary; he can narrate it to me.\" And that's how Sanjaya got the divine vision, so he could see everything while sitting in the palace.\n\nFor all practical purposes, Sanjaya became the first telecaster who narrated what was happening in a distant place. He was given this vision so that he could not only see what was happening there, but also hear what Krishna and Arjuna were talking about, and even see in their minds what they were thinking. So now, since Arjuna has concluded, Sanjaya gives the final comments. The last five verses are Sanjaya's -- he is the third party. Arjuna was involved in it completely.\n\nHe was the recipient of this knowledge. Knowledge was directly given to him. Krishna was the giver of the knowledge, and he obviously had not only Arjuna but everyone's betterment in mind. Sanjaya is the third party, looking at the situation, and now gives his version of what he has seen.\n\nSo the next five verses which conclude Bhagavad Gita -- Sanjaya said: Ithi Aham Vasudevashya Parthasyacha Mahatmanah Samvadam Imam Ashrausham Adbhutam Romaharshanam. He said, \"This is me witnessing the dialogue between Vasudeva and Partha.\" Krishna is called Vasudeva because he is the son of Vasudeva -- Vasudevasutam Devam, Devaki's son. He's also called Vasudeva because he is the Deva of the Vasavas.\n\nThe Vasavas, as we learned in chapter 10, are the deities of the seasons. There are eight seasons, and each season has its own presiding deity. As we have said, in our culture everything is personified, and nothing can really work in a chaotic situation. Everything has its own order. If there is order, we absolutely know there is a controller -- without any laws or enforcing agency, there cannot be any order. Since in nature there is a perfect order, there have to be lawmakers and law enforcers. The enforcing deities for these seasons are the Vasavas, the Vasus.\n\nThese eight Vasus are controlling the eight seasons. As we may have discussed before, the six seasons we commonly know are summer, winter, monsoon, and then subsets like spring and fall -- so there are six seasons. Where are the other two? The other two are in our mind: happiness and unhappiness.\n\nSo two micro seasons and six macro seasons make eight, with their presiding deities. All Vasus are Vasavas, and the Deva of the Vasus is Vasudeva. So he is the Deva of all the seasons -- in other words, the Deva of all the seasons in our life. He is the presiding deity, Vasudeva, the consciousness. All these eight seasons are perceived by me because consciousness is functioning through me.\n\nSo this is the dialogue between Vasudeva and Mahatmana Partha -- High-Souled Arjuna. Arjuna is called \"High-Souled\" here not because he was Krishna's cousin or Pandu's son, but because he is a normal man who faced the challenges of life and broke down -- yet he had the courage to listen to the right advice and rise to the situation. Therefore he is high-souled: not because he was perfect, not because he had no faults, but because he had the normal faults of a normal person and the courage to overcome them. So Sanjaya said, \"The dialogue between the supreme self, the sacred, and the normal man Partha -- listening to this, I am so thrilled that I am having goosebumps.\"\n\nWhat have I experienced so wonderful? He said this was an incredible dialogue which he never thought he would be able to witness in his life. And then he continues: Vyasa Prasadat Shrutavan Etat Guhyam Aham Param Yogam Yogeshwarat Krishnat Sakshat Kathayatah Svayam. \"I had the good fortune of listening to this dialogue because of Vyasa Prasadat. I was not capable of listening to it on my own. I would never have been able to see what Krishna and Arjuna were talking about. It was possible for me to hear because of the grace of Vyasa.\" We have seen why Vyasa gave him the divine vision, and therefore he could listen to it.\n\nAny experience which I feel is incredible in my life, I always think it came to me by somebody's grace -- in this case, Vyasa's grace. He said, Yogam Yogeshwarat Krishnat Sakshat Kathayatah -- this dialogue which describes the yoga, I heard directly from the mouth of Yogeshwara Krishna. We have learned before that Krishna is Yogeshwara -- he is the Lord of Yoga, the perfect Avatara. There was never a time he was not connected with his supreme self. He was always a man walking on this earth, yet always connected with his supreme self. One who is connected with his supreme self is a Yogi.\n\nKrishna is Yogeshwara. He is the Lord of all yogis, because there was never a time in his life, from the time he was born till he left, when he was not connected to his supreme self. Sanjaya says, \"I heard from a person who is Yogeshwara, from his mouth directly.\" In other words, it's not that this was something completely new to him.\n\nGrowing up in Vedic culture as the minister or private secretary of the great king, he had heard these things before. But now he heard directly from the Lord himself, the one who is one with the supreme self. So this now completely clarifies any doubt he ever had in his mind. This is now his direct knowledge. He experienced directly what the Lord has said. The next verse says: Rajan Samsmritya Samsmritya Samvadam Imam Adbhutam Keshava Arjunayoho Punyam Hrishyami Cha Muhurmuhuhu.\n\n\"I keep remembering what I have just experienced, over and over again. The more I think about it, the more joy it gives me -- to know that the self is immutable, imperishable. More and more I remember, and it gives me great strength and great joy, that I have heard from the great soul what reality is.\" So Sanjaya is trying to impress upon Dhritarashtra: you are not facing somebody mortal -- your sons are facing someone who is the Lord himself, who has direct knowledge. And he will be on Arjuna's side.\n\nTat Cha Samsmritya Samsmritya Rupam Atyadbhutam Hareho Vismayo Me Mahan Rajan Hrishyami Cha Punaha Punaha. \"Not only did I hear the dialogue between the two, but I also saw his Virat Rupa, his cosmic form. I've seen your sons going into his mouth and getting crushed. I have seen these Mahatmas praising him, some in fear and some in awe.\" That wondrous vision -- Tat Samsmritya Hareho -- that wonderful, magnificent form, he keeps remembering over and over again. And he is wonderstruck.\n\n\"I am completely wonderstruck about that vision. O Rajan, Hrishyami Cha Punaha Punaha. I rejoice again and again just remembering the Lord's complete form.\" And I know that the victory will be on the side of the truth. Obviously all the good people who knew what is right, including Drona, Bheeshma, Sanjaya, Vidur. But they could not be on the Pandava side because of the Niti Shastra at that time, if you have eaten somebody's salt, in other words, if you're obliged by somebody, you have to be on their side, no matter how wrong he is.\n\nTherefore they cannot be on the Pandavas' side. But they are making every effort to see whether Dhritarashtra changes his mind. He is the one person who has complete control to stop this war right then and there. But as we have said, he has already confessed he is very comfortable in his blindness, in his ignorance. He does not want to come out of his comfort zone of what he knows. This is basically where we are at some level -- clinging to something familiar.\n\nWe are afraid of change. That's why from one generation to another there is always a generation gap. In my old age, I am so comfortable in what I do. I get completely baffled by all this technology and social media. And so we need support from somebody younger who can guide us.\n\nThat's a source of wonder for me. The last verse is the complete conclusion of what Sanjaya has learned. But this is not merely Sanjaya's opinion -- it is a direct teaching for us on how to live life. It says: Yatra Yogeshwara Krishna Yatra Partha Dhanurdharaha Tatra Shri Vijaya Bhutihi Dhruvah Nitihi Matir Mama. Where there is Yogeshwara Krishna -- he didn't simply say just Krishna.\n\nWhere there is Krishna, where there is Arjuna -- Yatra Yogeshwara Krishna -- where there is the Lord of Yoga, the Lord Krishna. And what does that mean for us? That person is the one who is always one with his supreme self. That Yogeshwara Krishna is present in our consciousness. When we invoke our consciousness, our divine vision -- the sacred in us, the divine in us -- along with Yatra Partha Dhanurdharaha, where there is Arjuna with his bow and arrow ready to fight -- not lying on the ground as was the case in the first chapter. When we face challenges in this life, we have the tools to fight this battle.\n\nBut we get dejected and put our tools down and say I'm not ready. So we cannot win that battle and therefore there cannot be any success. World will be what it is. You will be facing this battle of life no matter how sacred and pious you are. Because that's the nature of the world. What you have to be is Dhanurdhara Partha -- not just Partha, but Dhanurdhara Partha. Partha is a common man like you and I.\n\nThe only difference is he's ready to fight. So when you are ready to fight the challenges of life -- but not just with your ego saying, \"I can take care of myself\" --",
      "reflection": "The Gita concludes with Sanjaya's joyful declaration. Verses 76-77: repeatedly remembering this wonderful, sacred dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna, I rejoice again and again. Recalling that supremely wondrous form of Hari, great is my amazement, and I rejoice repeatedly. The teaching has not just informed Sanjaya but transformed him. He cannot stop thinking about it, and each remembrance brings fresh joy and wonder.\n\nVerse 78 is the Gita's triumphant conclusion: yatra Yogeshvara Krishna yatra Partho dhanurdharah tatra shrir vijayo bhutir dhruva nitir - wherever is Krishna, the Lord of Yoga, and Arjuna, the archer with bow ready, there are fortune, victory, prosperity, and firm righteousness. This is the promise and the formula. When higher wisdom (Krishna/Yogeshvara) combines with prepared, committed action (Arjuna/Dhanurdhara), success is assured.\n\nThis final verse is your daily practice in condensed form: Invoke the Lord of Yoga in your heart - the wisdom, the guidance, the connection to the Supreme. Then take up your bow - bring your skills, your preparation, your readiness to act. Together, these ensure victory - not necessarily the victory your ego envisions, but the victory of dharma, the triumph of what is right. Today, bring both elements to whatever challenge you face: yogeshvara (higher guidance) and dhanurdhara (capable readiness). Neither alone is sufficient - passive wisdom without action, or frantic action without wisdom, both fail. United, they are invincible. This is the Gita's final teaching: connect to the Source, prepare yourself, act decisively. Shri, vijaya, bhuti, and dhruva niti will follow."
